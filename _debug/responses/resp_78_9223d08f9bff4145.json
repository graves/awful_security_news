  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a tense working lunch meeting in which Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, including giving up parts of the Donbas region. The meeting, described as acrimonious by European officials, saw Trump raise his voice and insist on a ceasefire along current battle lines, contradicting earlier statements that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. Trump later clarified that he did not demand full surrender of Donbas and emphasized the need to stop killing civilians and end the war at existing frontlines. Ukrainian officials downplayed the tension, calling it constructive, while noting Zelensky and Trump agreed on a ceasefire at current battle lines. The meeting reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to ending the war, influenced by his success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza and concerns over war escalation and winter casualties. The article highlights the growing conflict between Trump’s demand for territorial concessions and Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty.",
