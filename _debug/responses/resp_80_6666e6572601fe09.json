Although he clarified that U.S. forces would not directly intervene, he authorized regional actors to take action under U.S. auspices. This threat comes amid reports that Hamas has used the ceasefire to target Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli forces, undermining confidence in the peace deal and prompting concerns about its stability. Trump reiterated that Israel could resume military operations if Hamas fails to comply, and he expressed confidence that Hamas would honor its commitments, warning that failure to do so would result in consequences.",
