  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has entered La Santé prison in Paris to begin serving a 5-year sentence for a criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya, a historic moment as he becomes the first former head of state in modern French history to be imprisoned. The conviction stems from allegations that between 2005 and 2007, Sarkozy, then interior minister and presidential candidate, used his influence to channel illicit funds from Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi regime. He will serve his sentence in solitary confinement, with limited contact to others, and is allowed one hour of outdoor time and three family visits weekly. Sarkozy and his legal team contest the conviction and the court’s decision to incarcerate him before appeal, calling the case a political scandal and a violation of justice. A powerful public demonstration of support has emerged in France, with citizens and political figures affirming his innocence and criticizing the judicial process. The case has also triggered concern among legal experts about potential political interference, especially with current Justice Minister, a former conservative, possibly visiting Sarkozy in prison, threatening judicial independence.",
