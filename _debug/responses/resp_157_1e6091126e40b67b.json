  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Lebanese court has ordered the release on $11 million bail of Hannibal Gaddafi, the son of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who has been held in pre-trial detention since 2015. The decision stems from allegations that Gaddafi withheld information about the 1978 disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia leader Musa al-Sadr during a visit to Libya. The al-Sadr family and Human Rights Watch have criticized the detention as arbitrary and unjust, while Gaddafi’s lawyer Laurent Bayon claims the bail is unattainable due to international sanctions and financial constraints. Libyan authorities have previously requested Lebanon’s cooperation in freeing Gaddafi to help uncover the truth behind al-Sadr’s disappearance, especially given Gaddafi’s deteriorating health and hunger strike. The ruling marks a pivotal moment in a decades-long political and humanitarian dispute between Lebanon and Libya over a historical event still shrouded in mystery.",
