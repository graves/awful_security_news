  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors from the Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to serve as James Comey’s defense attorney, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to share classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies these claims, asserting that the memos Comey shared were unclassified at the time and citing a prior inspector general report that found no evidence of leaks. The dispute raises significant ethical concerns about conflict of interest, as Fitzgerald may have been both a witness and a defense counsel in the same case. Experts note that such a role violates fundamental legal principles. The case highlights tensions between national security, legal ethics, and political accountability surrounding the 2016 Russian election investigation.",
