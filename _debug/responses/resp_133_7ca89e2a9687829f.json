  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Milwaukee Brewers, who had a strong regular-season record and a dominant history in regular-season matchups against the Los Angeles Dodgers, were swept in a four-game playoff series, failing to reach the World Series. The Dodgers, led by a historic performance from two-way star Shohei Ohtani—who hit three home runs and struck out 10 in a two-hit, scoreless outing—outpaced the Brewers both offensively and defensively. Despite the Brewers’ regular-season success and financial constraints (payroll of $124.8 million vs. Dodgers’ projected $509.5 million), the team struggled with energy, offensive production (only four runs in four games), and pitching, particularly in a key Game 4 against veteran pitcher Jose Quintana. The article highlights both the underdog narrative and the growing dominance of elite players like Ohtani in shaping playoff outcomes, while also emphasizing team resilience and camaraderie in the face of disappointment.",
