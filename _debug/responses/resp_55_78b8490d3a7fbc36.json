  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, who used the alias Arthur Knight and faked his death in 2020, to a prison term ranging from five years to life for two rape convictions from 2008. The case emerged from a decade-old rape kit backlog in Utah, where Rossi was identified through DNA. After being arrested in Scotland via an Interpol notice based on his tattoos—including a Brown University crest—he was extradited to Utah in 2024. Rossi, described as a 'serial abuser of women' and 'flight risk,' had previously evaded justice in Rhode Island and faced fraud charges in Ohio. The victims testified about financial manipulation and abuse, emphasizing trauma and a need for accountability. The case highlights the dangers of false death claims, identity deception, and the importance of addressing rape kit backlogs to bring perpetrators to justice.",
