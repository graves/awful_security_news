  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1993 by defeating the Seattle Mariners in a seven-game ALCS, overcoming a strong Mariners team that had a 2-0 series lead. The Blue Jays' dramatic turnaround from a last-place finish in 2024 to a 94-68 record in 2025, along with their 34-run performance against the Yankees in the ALDS, underscores their rise. However, they narrowly avoided elimination in the ALCS due to critical errors and a late-game home run by George Springer. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the largest payroll and a dominant postseason run — including a legendary performance by Shohei Ohtani — are the defending champions and poised to become the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back titles. The Blue Jays face a significant challenge in the World Series, especially in the bullpen, while the Dodgers are known for superior pitching and defense. The series begins on October 24, 2025, in Toronto, marking a pivotal moment in baseball history.",
