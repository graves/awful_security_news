  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced the immediate end of all U.S. payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to stop drug production, despite years of financial support. The move escalates a long-standing diplomatic conflict between the two leaders, rooted in disagreements over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean. The U.S. has provided over $210 million in aid this fiscal year, including $31 million in agricultural support, making it Colombia’s largest funder. Trump criticized Petro as an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened military action, while Petro responded with cultural and ideological criticism, referencing Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez to highlight the U.S. lack of understanding of Colombian society. The incident also follows a series of U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats, with one strike resulting in the deaths of all three on board and another resulting in two survivors being returned to their countries. These developments underscore a dramatic deterioration in U.S.-Colombia relations, driven by economic, security, and political tensions.",
