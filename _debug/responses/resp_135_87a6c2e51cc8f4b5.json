    "Takaichi has formed a fragile coalition with the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), a conservative opposition party, which lacks long-term stability and may not provide sufficient legislative support.",
    "Her policies include a strong military buildup, support for male-only imperial succession, opposition to same-sex marriage, and resistance to reforms allowing married couples to retain separate last names.",

    "Experts warn that a Takaichi government may be short-lived, with an early election possibly needed to regain majority support."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sanae Takaichi, 64, is poised to become Japan’s first female prime minister after the collapse of the LDP-Komeito coalition, triggered by Komeito’s exit over concerns about Takaichi’s ultraconservative policies. She will replace Shigeru Ishiba and form a fragile coalition with the Japan Innovation Party (JIP), a conservative opposition group, to secure parliamentary votes. Despite this historic milestone, her leadership faces major challenges: strong opposition to women’s rights reforms (including same-sex marriage and dual last names), diplomatic tensions with China and South Korea due to her support for visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and a minority coalition that may not have long-term legislative stability. Takaichi, a protege of Shinzo Abe, is expected to follow his economic and security policies, including doubling Japan’s defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027. She faces pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to increase military spending to NATO levels. Experts warn that her government may be short-lived due to internal instability, lack of broad support, and conflicting policy priorities. Political observers note this shift reflects a broader trend of multiparty politics and declining popularity of mainstream parties in Japan.",
