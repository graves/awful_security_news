  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals that Guatemala’s garment factories (maquilas), which supply clothing to major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, operate under exploitative conditions. Workers—mostly women—earn minimal wages, work long hours, and face threats, harassment, and wage theft. Korean-owned companies dominate the sector, controlling nearly two-thirds of investments. Despite promises of reform under new President Bernardo Arévalo, enforcement remains weak due to factory resistance, lack of access to inspections, and threats to union members. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial devastation when factories close, with no severance or pension. The article highlights a culture of fear, with union leaders like Corina Olivares facing violence after her predecessor was murdered. It also underscores the systemic failure of US brands and Guatemalan institutions to ensure safe and fair labor practices, calling attention to the human cost of global supply chains.",
