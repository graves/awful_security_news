This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has served time in prison. Sarkozy claims he is innocent and expresses sorrow over what he perceives as political vengeance and national humiliation. He is being held in the VIP wing of La Santé Prison, a high-security facility previously housing notorious figures such as Manuel Noriega, Carlos the Jackal, and Jacques Mesrine. The prison’s conditions are described as relatively comfortable but noisy. Sarkozy’s legal team has requested early release, with a two-month window for the court to decide. The case raises concerns about foreign interference in elections, transparency in campaign financing, and the judicial treatment of high-profile political figures.",
