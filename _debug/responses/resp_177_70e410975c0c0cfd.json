  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed openness to joining a proposed trilateral summit with US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary, under a 'shuttle diplomacy' format, emphasizing a just peace over a quick one. The meeting between Zelensky and Trump was described as frank and acrimonious, with Trump reportedly threatening to have Putin 'destroy' Ukraine and insisting on surrendering the Donbas region. Zelensky criticized Hungary as an unsuitable location, citing Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s lack of support for Ukraine. Despite Zelensky’s efforts to secure US support for Tomahawk missiles, the request was met with non-commitment. Trump has shifted his position to suggest Ukraine could reclaim all territory, contradicting previous claims of territorial concessions, and has been pressuring NATO, China, and India to halt purchases of Russian oil as economic pressure. The article highlights deep disagreements between the US, Ukraine, and Russia, and the fragility of diplomatic engagement amid significant ideological and strategic divides.",
