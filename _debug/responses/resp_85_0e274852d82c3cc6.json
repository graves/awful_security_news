  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats across multiple states—including Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania—are reactivating abortion rights as a core campaign issue, despite it not being the top voter concern. In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger has highlighted her opponent, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears’ anti-abortion record, using targeted advertising and personal narratives from candidates like Ghazala Hashmi and Jay Jones to frame abortion as a matter of women’s rights and healthcare access. Virginia remains the only Southern state without post-Roe abortion restrictions, making it a strategic flashpoint. While polling shows that threats to democracy, inflation, and immigration are more pressing for voters, trust in Democratic candidates on reproductive rights remains strong by a 20-point margin. Democrats plan to push for a constitutional ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in Virginia. Republicans, including Earle-Sears and Jack Ciattarelli, have tried to downplay abortion, while former President Trump's actions—including cutting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood and studying mifepristone safety—are cited as threats to access. Advocates warn against repeating the political mistakes of 2024, where abortion was downplayed, arguing that the issue remains vital to Democratic electoral strategy and voter alignment.",
