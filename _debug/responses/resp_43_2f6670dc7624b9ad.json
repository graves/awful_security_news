  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli forensics have identified the body of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli soldier killed during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, as the 13th deceased hostage returned under the US-proposed ceasefire agreement. Haimi, who was defending a kibbutz, is survived by his wife, four children, father, and sister. The return of his body, retrieved through Red Cross efforts in Gaza, follows earlier challenges, including Hamas's reported misidentification of one body. Despite the ceasefire agreement requiring Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, Israeli intelligence believes full recovery is unlikely due to war damage. The Trump administration has threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the agreement, and high-level meetings between US officials and Israeli military leaders are ongoing to enforce compliance. The identification of Haimi’s body highlights both the humanitarian dimension of the crisis and the diplomatic fragility of the ceasefire, with continued tensions and accusations of violations undermining its implementation.",
