The decision, which nullifies a landmark case in Colombia’s history, has reignited political polarization, with critics accusing the judiciary of enabling cover-ups of right-wing paramilitary abuses. Senator Ivan Cepeda has announced plans to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, and the case is now poised to have a major impact on Colombia’s 2026 presidential election. The ruling has also drawn international attention, with U.S. officials like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio criticizing Latin American judicial systems as biased against conservative leaders.
