  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early exposure to peanuts in infancy significantly reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that this public health intervention has made a measurable impact. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in U.S. children under age 3 have declined by more than 27% and by over 40% after expanded guidelines were issued in 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records and found that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies due to early allergen introduction. Despite initial confusion among medical professionals—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the recommendations—the practice is now being adopted, supported by evidence from the LEAP trial, which showed over 80% allergy risk reduction. Experts and advocacy groups like FARE now endorse early exposure to allergens such as peanut butter and soy-based products between 4 and 6 months of age as safe and effective. The findings underscore a significant shift in public health, reducing the prevalence of a life-threatening condition that once affected over 2% of children.",
