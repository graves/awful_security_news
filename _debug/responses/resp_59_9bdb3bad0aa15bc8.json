  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Roughly 42 million Americans are at risk of losing food stamp benefits in November due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture warning that the program will run out of funds in two weeks. The Trump administration has not committed to funding SNAP, unlike its use of tariff revenue to sustain WIC, and has blamed Democrats for the political impasse. While a $6 billion contingency fund exists, it is insufficient to cover the $8 billion needed for November payments. As a result, 17 states have paused new food stamp applications, and experts warn that food pantries are already overwhelmed. This crisis is part of a broader national debate over whether political priorities should override critical social safety net programs, especially with Thanksgiving approaching. Advocacy groups and state leaders are calling for urgent intervention to prevent vulnerable families from going hungry.",
