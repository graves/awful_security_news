  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has a long history of renovations, with each presidential administration leaving a unique mark. From Theodore Roosevelt’s 1902 construction of the West Wing, which replaced Victorian conservatories, to Harry Truman's 1946–1952 overhaul that included a bowling alley and structural gutting, the building has consistently evolved. Jacqueline Kennedy’s 1960s restoration featured a televised tour and the restoration of the Resolute Desk, enhancing public engagement. More recently, President Barack Obama converted a tennis court into a basketball court, and current renovations under a modern president are creating a new ballroom in the East Wing—echoing a tradition of adapting the White House to reflect the values and interests of each administration. These changes illustrate how the White House serves not just as a residence, but as a living symbol of American political history, culture, and change.",
