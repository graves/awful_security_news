  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance visited Israel to reinforce the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, downplaying concerns about its fragility despite internal administration worries. While Vance expressed optimism and refused to set deadlines for Hamas’ disarmament or the return of hostages, he emphasized the need for continuous mediation. The visit is seen as a show of force to ensure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the deal. Tensions escalated after Hamas was accused of an attack that killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed dozens in Gaza. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire, though Israeli officials are pushing for Hamas demilitarization. Trump, meanwhile, dismissed the attack as not being led by Hamas leaders, calling it a 'rebellion,' and threatened to 'eradicate' the group if necessary, while signaling that allies may enter Gaza to address the situation. The next 30 days are deemed critical for the ceasefire to hold and for talks to move to a second phase.",
