  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democrats are attempting to pressure Republicans into extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts during a prolonged government shutdown, using public concern over rising health care costs as a central argument. While they have built divisions within the Republican Party and demonstrated political backbone, President Donald Trump has defied conventional political norms by firing federal workers, diverting tariff revenues to protect key social programs, and refusing to negotiate on reopening the government. Despite strong public disapproval of Trump's actions, Democrats face challenges in gaining public and political traction due to their own poor perception and the Republican Party's hardening stance. Progressive leaders like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez insist on concessions without guarantees, while Republican leaders like John Thune and John Kennedy believe the shutdown may become the longest in history. The political stalemate shows no immediate resolution, with potential future leverage at Thanksgiving, but the fundamental conflict—centered on health care policy and the president’s disregard for constitutional norms—suggests a deep and enduring standoff.",
