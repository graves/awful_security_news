  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is set to begin a five-year prison sentence at Paris’ La Santé prison on October 20, 2025, after being convicted of criminal conspiracy involving illegal campaign financing from Libya. Despite maintaining his innocence and protesting the decision, the judge ruled that he must serve the sentence immediately due to the severity of the offense and its disruption to public order. The prison, renowned for housing high-profile figures like Captain Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal, will house Sarkozy in a small 9-square-meter cell, possibly in a VIP section with limited amenities. Former inmates such as Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological and physical shock of incarceration, emphasizing the loss of status and privacy. Sarkozy will be allowed to bring 10 family photos and three books, including 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and a biography of Jesus Christ. He plans to file an appeal after entering prison, with a two-month processing window. The case marks a landmark moment in French political history, raising questions about the treatment of former leaders and the balance between accountability and personal liberty.",
