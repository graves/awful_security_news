  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using royal titles such as Duke of York following renewed public and political pressure linked to his alleged long-term contacts with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Though he has stepped down from using titles, he still holds his princely status and remains legally a prince. Giuffre’s memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl', alleges that Andrew treated her as if sex with her was a birthright and that his team attempted to silence her with a gag order. Opposition politicians, including SNP member Stephen Flynn, have called for formal legislation to strip Andrew and others like Peter Mandelson of their titles, citing public outrage and trauma to victims. The UK government and Buckingham Palace have declined to act unilaterally, citing constitutional separation between monarchy and politics. The Metropolitan Police are investigating whether Andrew in 2011 asked a bodyguard to investigate Giuffre’s background, suggesting possible efforts to smear her reputation. Questions remain over the cost and access to Royal Lodge, where Andrew lives, and the financial responsibility of the Crown Estate. With Giuffre's death in 2025 and the ongoing revelations, the royal family faces mounting pressure to address the legacy of these allegations.",
