  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 and convicted on fraud charges related to fabricated biographical details, was released from prison on October 18, 2025, after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence. The commutation came amid public and political controversy, with Trump citing mistreatment in solitary confinement and calling for 'fairness' and a chance for rehabilitation. Santos had previously pleaded guilty in August 2024 and expressed full responsibility for his actions, while also appealing for a second chance. The move drew praise from some Republican allies, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and others, who claimed Santos was unfairly treated, but criticism from Democratic leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued Trump should have addressed broader national issues like healthcare. The case underscores tensions in U.S. politics over justice, accountability, and the role of presidential clemency.",
