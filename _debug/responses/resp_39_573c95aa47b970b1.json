  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the hidden labor abuses in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, which supply clothing to major US brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt. Despite being central to Guatemala’s economy and contributing nearly 10% of GDP, these factories operate under exploitative conditions: workers face long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats to union activity. Most factories are owned by Korean companies, which control nearly two-thirds of investments, and US brands do not hold legal responsibility for labor conditions due to complex subcontracting. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra endure financial devastation, with no pensions or severance, and face threats, violence, and suppression when attempting to organize. The Guatemalan Ministry of Labor struggles to enforce regulations due to factory resistance, and union leaders have been murdered or threatened. Though President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms such as a 6% wage increase, enforcement remains weak. The article raises concerns about the sustainability and ethics of a global supply chain built on exploitation, particularly for women and marginalized communities.",
