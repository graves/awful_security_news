  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Judge Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal agencies, particularly Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for allegedly violating her order restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests in response to Operation Midway Blitz — a Trump administration-led immigration enforcement campaign that resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, 2025. Despite claims by officials that body-worn cameras are now mandatory and that no tear gas was used without warning, the judge expressed serious concern that the order was not being followed. She has called for testimony from key officials, including former ICE Chicago head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino, and has mandated camera use to ensure transparency. Protests continued at the Broadview ICE facility, with over 25 arrests reported, highlighting ongoing public resistance to federal immigration enforcement actions.",
