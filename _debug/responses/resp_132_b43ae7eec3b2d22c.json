  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether individuals who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own firearms, following a case revived by the Trump administration involving Texas man Ali Danial Hemani. Hemani was originally charged with a felony for possessing a gun in his home while being a regular marijuana user, and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a federal ban on gun ownership for drug users is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court’s 2022 expanded interpretation of the Second Amendment. The Justice Department has appealed this decision, asserting that such a ban is justified due to public safety risks, citing FBI findings of drugs and a gun in Hemani’s home. Hemani’s legal team argues the law unfairly criminalizes millions of Americans, as approximately 20% of U.S. adults have used marijuana, and half of U.S. states have legalized recreational use. This case represents a key test of how the Supreme Court’s new firearm rights framework applies to drug use, with broader implications for gun ownership policies and constitutional interpretation.",
