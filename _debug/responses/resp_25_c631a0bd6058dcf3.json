  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has made its first confirmed discovery of mosquitoes in the wild, with three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species found in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. This marks a significant ecological shift, as mosquitoes were previously absent from Iceland due to its extreme cold climate. The discovery, initiated by local resident Björn Hjaltason who spotted a strange fly, was verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson. While the species is native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere and capable of surviving freezing temperatures, it is unclear how the mosquitoes arrived in Iceland—possibly via ships or containers. Experts are divided on whether climate change directly caused this event, with some suggesting it may have increased the likelihood of mosquito establishment, while others argue that natural range shifts already occur in colder regions. The finding underscores broader global trends of expanding mosquito habitats due to warming climates, and highlights the need for further monitoring to determine if the species can survive and establish long-term populations in Iceland.",
