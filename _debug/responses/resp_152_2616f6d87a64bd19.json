  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims on October 9, 2025, asserting that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing two flawed studies — a 2013 cross-national analysis and a 2015 Danish study — and a 2025 unpeer-reviewed preprint from WPLab. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, clarify that neither study establishes causation, both have significant methodological flaws such as small sample sizes, lack of data on acetaminophen use, and failure to account for confounding variables. The 2013 study found only a weak correlation, not causation, and the 2015 study’s results are based on extremely limited data. The WPLab paper, which claims acetaminophen causes autism, is unpeer-reviewed and not supported by scientific consensus. Decades of research show that acetaminophen is safe for infants when used as directed, and there is no evidence linking it to autism. Kennedy’s statements are misleading and contrary to medical and scientific evidence.",
