  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approached, several prominent institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—declined to participate. The Compact required colleges to enforce policies such as banning transgender students from restrooms and sports, freezing tuition, limiting international enrollment, and mandating standardized testing. Critics, including university leaders, argued that such policies conflict with academic merit, scientific research integrity, and diversity. Despite a White House meeting with multiple schools, no institutions agreed to sign, with leaders citing concerns about political interference in education and erosion of trust in higher learning institutions. The controversy highlights growing resistance to politically driven academic mandates and raises broader concerns about the role of federal funding in shaping university policies.",
