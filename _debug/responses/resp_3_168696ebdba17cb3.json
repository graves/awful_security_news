  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration secured a legal victory in Portland, Oregon, when a 2-1 decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court order blocking the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops, citing the president’s lawful exercise of statutory authority. However, a second restraining order still prevents immediate mobilization. The ruling sparked significant backlash from state officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who argue it undermines state sovereignty and the First Amendment. Similar legal challenges are unfolding in Illinois and Tennessee, where local leaders assert no emergency exists and that troop deployments violate state law or constitutional principles. In San Francisco, the mayor and governor publicly oppose the deployment, emphasizing that the National Guard cannot address drug-related crime. The broader issue centers on the scope of presidential power in deploying military forces during domestic protests, with a bipartisan Senate group calling for an inquiry into the impacts of such actions on military readiness and constitutional rights.",
