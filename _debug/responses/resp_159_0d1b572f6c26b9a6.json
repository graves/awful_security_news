  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-powered voice scams targeting Italian businessmen has exposed how advanced deepfake technology can mimic real human voices with near-perfect realism. Fraudsters cloned the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to solicit money for a fake rescue operation involving kidnapped journalists, leading to financial losses and prompting public disclosure. Research by Queen Mary University of London confirms that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real ones, with participants rating them as more trustworthy. The global scale of deepfake fraud is growing—over $500 million lost in 2025 alone—while AI-generated content including sexual abuse material has reached alarming levels. This raises serious concerns about identity theft, misinformation, and privacy, prompting legislative responses from the U.S. and Australia. Despite risks, the technology also offers compassionate applications such as restoring speech for people with voice impairments.",
