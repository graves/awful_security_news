  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be contributing to illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. Despite promises made in 2009 to track indirect suppliers, JBS lacks the ability to verify the origins of its cattle due to Brazil’s flawed animal transit permit (GTA) system, which does not track individual animals. The report documents illegal land encroachment in protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, with state agency Adepará authorizing cattle transport without environmental oversight. With deforestation in Pará rising 421% in 2024 and critical climate discussions set to take place at COP30, experts and advocacy groups stress that voluntary corporate commitments are insufficient and that the Brazilian government must implement stronger, enforceable traceability systems—such as making GTA data publicly accessible—before illegal ranching continues to thrive.",
