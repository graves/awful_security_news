    "A mysterious diffuse glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has long puzzled scientists, with two main theories: pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars) and dark matter collisions.",
    "Recent supercomputer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues show that dark matter could have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center — matching the observed glow’s shape, which previously favored the pulsar theory.",
    "The new findings suggest a 50% chance the glow originates from dark matter, challenging the long-held assumption that dark matter is uniformly spherical.",
    "The study supports the hypothesis that dark matter might consist of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), which annihilate and produce gamma rays when they collide.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate by 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively determine if the glow is from dark matter or pulsars.",
    "While the new simulation does not provide conclusive proof, it reinvigorates the dark matter hypothesis and strengthens the scientific case for continuing the search for WIMPs via ground-based detectors like the LZ Dark Matter Experiment."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A long-standing mystery of the galactic center — a mysterious, diffuse glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope — may finally be gaining support for a dark matter explanation. While pulsars were previously favored due to the glow's shape resembling the galactic bulge, new supercomputer simulations show that dark matter could have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center, closely matching the observed data. Led by Joseph Silk and colleagues, the simulations suggest a 50% chance the glow originates from dark matter, particularly WIMPs — hypothetical particles that annihilate and produce gamma rays. The findings do not provide definitive proof but reinvigorate the dark matter theory. A new gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to operate by 2027, will offer high-resolution data to confirm or rule out this link. The discovery would be a breakthrough in physics, confirming dark matter’s existence and nature, while also deepening the global scientific effort to detect WIMPs through both space and ground-based experiments.",
