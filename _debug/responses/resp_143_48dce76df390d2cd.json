  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine island of Catanduanes, thousands of residents have evacuated due to the threat of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high and heavy rainfall. The storm is expected to pass near the island with sustained winds up to 80km/h, and local officials have activated evacuation plans for high-risk zones. This event occurs amid a broader context of increasing climate-related disasters, with scientists linking stronger storms to global warming. The Philippines, which faces an average of 20 storms and typhoons annually, is still recovering from recent earthquakes and typhoons, including a magnitude 7.4 quake and the deadly Typhoon Ragasa. The repeated occurrence of such disasters underscores the region’s vulnerability and the urgent need for resilient disaster preparedness.",
