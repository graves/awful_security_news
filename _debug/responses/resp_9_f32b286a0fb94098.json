  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have collapsed, as the administration now states there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This follows a previous announcement that a summit would happen within two weeks after a phone call between the two leaders. Officials say that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a productive but inconclusive call, with divergent views on ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov, viewed as a loyalist to Putin without real decision-making power, is seen as ineffective in advancing negotiations. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky blames the U.S. withholding long-range missiles for Russia’s reduced interest in diplomacy, suggesting that enhanced Ukrainian capabilities are key to ending the war. The Kremlin maintains that no date was set for the summit and thus cannot be postponed. While the direct Trump-Putin meeting is on hold, diplomatic efforts may continue through side meetings at a future ASEAN-led global summit in Malaysia.",
