  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A high-profile theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris, occurring on Sunday, October 20, 2025, involved the robbery of valuable royal jewelry including a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding gift to Marie-Louise. The thieves, believed to be armed with tools such as an angle grinder and blowtorch, broke into the Apollo Gallery through a window using a truck-mounted ladder, completing the heist in just seven minutes and fleeing on two scooters. French prosecutor Laure Beccuau estimated the stolen items are worth $102 million, with eight of nine items still missing. Authorities have recovered one scooter and a helmet, but no solid leads have emerged. Experts, including French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, author Elaine Sciolino, and Art Recovery International founder Christopher Marinello, warn that the jewelry may have been dismantled or sold on the black market for money laundering, with little chance of recovery. The incident has exposed serious security flaws at the museum, including unsecured windows and public access to equipment. The heist is seen as a profound cultural blow, akin to the 1911 Mona Lisa theft, and has sparked national outrage and concern over the long-term preservation of France’s heritage.",
