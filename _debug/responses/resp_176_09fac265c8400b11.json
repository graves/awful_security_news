  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing better than expected, with US Vice President JD Vance visiting Israel to support its implementation. Despite a recent Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered retaliatory air strikes killing dozens of Palestinians, both sides remain committed to the truce. Hamas has returned 13 of 28 deceased Israeli hostages, with more expected. The US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are pushing for long-term peace measures such as an interim Palestinian government, international stabilisation force, and Hamas disarmament. However, Israel has not agreed to engage in negotiations until Hamas returns all dead hostages, and humanitarian aid delivery remains severely constrained by limited crossings—only Kerem Shalom and Kissufim are open—leading to dire food shortages, especially in northern Gaza. The situation remains fragile, with concerns that Netanyahu may abandon the ceasefire, and the world watches as diplomacy and military actions continue to shape the future of the conflict.",
