  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Maccabi Tel Aviv has announced it will refuse to offer tickets for its upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa on November 6, 2025, despite calls from the UK government and public appeals to reverse a ban on its fans. The ban was imposed by West Midlands Police after a violent incident in Amsterdam during a match against Ajax in 2024, where fans clashed with locals, resulting in injuries and condemnation as antisemitic. The decision by Maccabi, citing fan safety and lessons learned from past violence, has drawn criticism from British leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who condemned the ban as a 'wrong decision'. The situation is part of a larger context of rising antisemitism in Britain following a synagogue attack and international calls for a sports boycott of Israel over actions in Gaza. The article also notes that similar controversies have occurred in other matches, such as the one against PAOK in Greece and the domestic derby with Hapoel in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, European basketball leagues have relocated matches from Israel since 2023 due to safety concerns. Maccabi emphasized its commitment to diversity and inclusivity, asserting that football should unite rather than divide.",
