  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Colorado dentist, James Craig, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline (from Visine eyedrops). The case unfolded over several weeks in early 2023, beginning with Craig’s romantic relationships and online searches for poisons. He created a fake email account to research lethal substances, ordered arsenic and cyanide through various suppliers, and repeatedly purchased eye drops using his credit card. Angela experienced worsening symptoms after consuming shakes made by her husband, leading to hospitalizations and eventually her death on March 18. Key witnesses, including office manager Caitlin Romero and dental partner Dr. Ryan Redfearn, discovered the cyanide delivery and raised concerns, which helped expose the plot. Forensic analysis confirmed high levels of toxins in Angela’s blood. The case raises concerns about the accessibility of poisons, the role of dating websites in enabling harmful relationships, and the potential for domestic violence disguised as illness.",
