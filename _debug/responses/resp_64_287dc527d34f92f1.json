  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, in response to escalating tensions over drug trafficking and U.S. military actions. The move follows a July incident when the U.S. recalled its ambassador in Bogotá and comes after President Donald Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of promoting drug production and threatened to raise tariffs on Colombian goods. The U.S. has conducted multiple attacks in the Caribbean on vessels suspected of drug trafficking, resulting in at least 30 deaths, with Colombia accusing the U.S. of targeting Colombian nationals and even committing 'murder.' These actions have intensified diplomatic friction, with Colombia asserting that U.S. actions are both unjust and politically motivated, marking the second time this year that Colombia has recalled its ambassador.",
