  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the United Nations, has issued a global call to action to address severe gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate infrastructure. With over 2 million deaths from weather, water, and climate-related disasters in the past 50 years—90% of which occurred in developing nations—the WMO stresses that early warnings are critical to saving lives and protecting infrastructure. Despite progress in early-warning adoption (from 52 to 108 countries in the last decade), assessments reveal that half of 62 evaluated countries have only basic or no capacity, with the situation being most dire in conflict-affected regions. The article highlights real-world examples such as the successful evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, due to a monitored glacier collapse in May 2025, and widespread disasters in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and southern Europe, all underscoring the urgent need for improved, accessible, and standardized early-warning systems globally.",
