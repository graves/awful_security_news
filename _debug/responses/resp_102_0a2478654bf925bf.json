  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite not securing approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The project, announced in July and now underway since October 2025, aims to accommodate up to 999 people, far exceeding the original 650-seat capacity. Trump claims the space is needed due to the East Room’s limited size and insists it will be privately funded by donors and himself, with Carrier Global Corp. donating an energy-efficient HVAC system. The demolition poses a major disruption to the East Wing, which has housed the First Lady's offices since 1902 and will be temporarily relocated. Key officials like Will Scharf and Karoline Leavitt have defended the actions, citing jurisdictional exceptions for demolition and site prep. The project, expected to be completed by January 2029, marks the largest structural change to the White House since the 1948 Truman Balcony and has sparked debate over federal oversight, historical preservation, and transparency of funding sources.",
