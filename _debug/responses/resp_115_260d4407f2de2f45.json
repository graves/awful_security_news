  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify both their social behavior and nest architecture in response to a deadly fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially caregivers—move farther from high-risk foragers, demonstrating a form of proactive social distancing. Additionally, nests exposed to the pathogen become more compartmentalized, with reduced tunnel connectivity, wider entrances, and longer travel routes, which slows disease transmission. These changes work together to protect vulnerable colony members. The research, published in Science, demonstrates the first known instance of a non-human social species actively reshaping its environment to defend against disease. Experts like Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Sarah Kocher suggest these natural strategies could inspire human-designed public spaces to reduce disease spread through a concept known as 'architectural immunity'.",
