  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest were abandoned after it became clear that Russia refuses to accept a ceasefire at the current front line in Ukraine. Key disagreements persist over whether to freeze the fighting line or pursue full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas. Trump expressed support for a 'cut and stop' ceasefire, while Russian officials, including Lavrov and Peskov, maintain that a sustainable peace requires addressing root causes like recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas and demilitarization of Ukraine. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was canceled after a 'productive' call, suggesting diplomatic momentum has shifted. European leaders and Zelensky have emphasized that freezing the front line is the first step in diplomacy, and that Russia’s participation in talks was likely prompted by fears over US missile supply. Despite the cancellation, the discussion over long-range weapons has been framed as a significant diplomatic breakthrough.",
