  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Meridah Nandudu, a woman from the rural Ugandan village of Bugibulungu, overcame personal trauma and gender-based economic oppression to found Bayaaya Specialty Coffee, a business that empowers over 600 women farmers by enabling them to sell coffee beans directly and earn income. Rooted in the traditional male-dominated structure of Ugandan coffee farming, where women perform labor but receive no financial benefits, Nandudu leveraged training from a Netherlands-funded program through AVSI-USA to gain expertise in coffee production and business management. She introduced a financial incentive model to convince male farmers to allow their wives to sell coffee, thereby securing direct financial independence for women. This shift has not only improved the economic conditions of women in her community but has also helped many escape abusive relationships. Her work has become a model of gender equity and sustainable entrepreneurship in rural Uganda, inspiring other women to pursue economic self-reliance. The article highlights how personal experiences of violence and marginalization can be transformed into powerful social change, with broader implications for women’s rights and economic development in agriculture worldwide.",
