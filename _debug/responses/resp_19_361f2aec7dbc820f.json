  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was serving a seven-year prison sentence for fraud charges, was released after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence in October 2025. Santos claims the prosecution was not political and that he has absorbed significant personal accountability by eating a 'very large slice of humble pie' during incarceration. Despite criticism from Republican colleagues like Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino, who argue the crimes warranted more than a brief prison term, Santos maintains that the commutation was not politically motivated and that he is now focused on prison reform and personal redemption. He has no plans to return to politics in the next decade and emphasizes that he will fulfill legal obligations regarding donor repayment. The case reflects broader tensions over executive clemency, political accountability, and the role of prisons in the U.S. justice system.",
