  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a vulnerable Philippine island, have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, bringing heavy rainfall and a risk of coastal flooding from up to 1.2-meter waves. The storm is forecast to pass near the island with winds up to 80km/h, prompting the provincial government to activate evacuation plans for high-risk coastal and landslide-prone areas. This event occurs amid a broader pattern of natural disasters in the Philippines, including recent earthquakes and typhoons, which have already caused significant loss of life and displacement. The situation underscores the country's ongoing struggle with climate change-related intensification of storms and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, placing vulnerable, impoverished communities at risk and highlighting the need for improved disaster preparedness and climate adaptation strategies.",
