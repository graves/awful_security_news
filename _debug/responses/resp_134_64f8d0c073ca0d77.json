  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in two decades, won the 2025 presidential runoff with 54.5% of the vote, signaling a dramatic end to decades of leftist rule under the MAS party. In a bid to restore stability, Paz pledged to rebuild relations with the United States and attract foreign investment, rejecting a proposed IMF bailout due to public resentment toward international financial institutions. He emphasized economic reform, including targeted fuel subsidies and a $3.5 billion loan with a $600 million additional plan to balance the budget. His campaign, boosted by populist running mate Edman Lara, resonated with rural and working-class voters, though it risks alienating former MAS supporters. Paz’s shift from alignment with Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro to support for Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado marks a regional realignment toward democracy. However, the transition faces challenges, including widespread protests over election legitimacy, deep-seated inflation (23% in September), and a national crisis of fuel supply. The new government faces the difficult task of balancing economic recovery with political stability, including reforming the judiciary and addressing Indigenous concerns over constitutional changes.",
