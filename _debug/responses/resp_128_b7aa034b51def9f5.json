The ban has drawn criticism from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called it a 'wrong decision'. Despite government efforts to resolve the situation and increase police resources, Maccabi has maintained that fan safety is paramount, emphasizing its commitment to inclusivity and anti-racism. The incident reflects broader concerns about antisemitism and sports boycotts related to the Gaza war, as well as the growing intersection of international politics and sports. The situation also highlights the sensitivity of fan safety regulations in European football, especially in the absence of a history of violence between Maccabi and Aston Villa fans.",
