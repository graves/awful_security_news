The U.S. canceled a preparatory meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, citing a 'productive' call, and a key diplomatic breakthrough—Russia's engagement on the issue—was triggered by concerns over the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that the front-line freeze represents the beginning of diplomacy, while Russia continues to avoid substantive negotiations, citing its demands for maximalist peace terms. The failure of the Trump-Putin meeting reflects broader challenges in achieving sustainable peace in the Ukraine conflict.",
