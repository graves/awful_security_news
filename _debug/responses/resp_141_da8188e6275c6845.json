    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals under restriction.",
    "The seven rare-earth metals previously restricted in April 2025 are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium.",
    "China now restricts the export of specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals.",
    "Export licenses are only granted if foreign companies clearly explain the intended use of the products containing rare-earth metals, especially those with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content.",
    "China cites national security and threats from foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications as justification for the controls.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for critical technologies such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, LED screens, camera lenses, and advanced defence systems including F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, and sourced 70% of its rare-earth compounds from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "The new controls are seen as a strategic move to strengthen China’s leverage during upcoming US-China negotiations, particularly ahead of the APEC summit in South Korea.",
    "Analysts view the move as 'pre-meeting choreography' to signal that China can weaponize its dominance in the rare-earth supply chain, especially in a high-stakes diplomatic setting.",
    "China has maintained exceptions for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, and disaster relief exports.",
    "The US has previously restricted China’s access to semiconductors, indicating a reciprocal strategic dynamic in the technology and defence supply chains.",
    "The move underscores the deep economic interdependence between the US and China, even as tensions rise, and highlights that full decoupling is not feasible."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of the 17 rare-earth elements—adding five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to earlier controls—effective December 1, 2025. The restrictions apply to both the metals themselves and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain special licenses detailing the intended use of the products. China justifies the move on national security grounds, citing unauthorized transfers of rare-earth materials to military or sensitive applications. The announcement comes just three weeks before President Donald Trump is expected to meet President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, framing it as a strategic diplomatic signal to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The US, the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruptions in critical sectors such as defence (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, missiles) and civilian technology (e.g., electric vehicles, AI, consumer electronics). Analysts interpret the move as 'pre-meeting choreography,' signaling China’s ability to weaponize its dominance in the rare-earth supply chain. While emergency medical and disaster relief exports remain exempt, the controls underscore the deep interdependence and geopolitical tensions between the US and China in the global technology and supply chain landscape.",
