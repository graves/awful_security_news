  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asserts that mounting public pressure—driven by the impending expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies and the start of open enrollment on November 1—will force Congress to extend health insurance subsidies to prevent catastrophic premium increases. With costs projected to rise by up to $2,000 per month, potentially reaching over $24,000 annually, Jeffries warns that millions of Americans, especially those earning under $63,000 a year, will face unaffordable health care. He opposes Republican proposals for a one-year extension, arguing that such measures fail to address deeper issues like Medicaid cuts and billionaire tax breaks. Jeffries also criticizes Republican efforts to pay furloughed federal workers as politically motivated and lawless, emphasizing that full government reopening and equitable health care access are essential. The article underscores the urgency of legislative action before the end of the open enrollment period, as public awareness of financial hardship grows across key states.",
