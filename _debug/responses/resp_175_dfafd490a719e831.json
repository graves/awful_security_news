  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In May 2024, Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner and amateur poet, shot Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico during a public visit to Handlova, about 180km from Bratislava. The attack occurred when Cintula believed Fico was a supporter, and he fired five shots at close range, seriously injuring Fico in the abdomen. Cintula claimed he only wanted to injure Fico to oppose policies he viewed as damaging to Slovakia. Despite his claim of not targeting vital organs, the court found him guilty of terrorism, rejecting his defense to charge as an attack on a public official. Judge Igor Kralik emphasized that the attack was specifically directed at the prime minister, not a random citizen. The case has sparked debate over political extremism and the role of rhetoric in inciting violence, with Fico himself blaming the opposition for fostering hatred, though he is known for controversial statements.",
