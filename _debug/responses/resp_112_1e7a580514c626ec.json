    "A classified satellite network built by SpaceX, known as Starshield, is emitting signals in the 2025–2110 MHz frequency band, which is normally reserved for Earth-to-satellite uplinks, not satellite-to-Earth downlinks.",
    "The transmission violates International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards, which regulate the use of radio spectrum globally, raising concerns about radio frequency interference with other satellites.",
    "The signals were first detected by amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley in Canada during a routine scan, who noticed an anomaly in a normally quiet frequency band.",
    "The Starshield network, a classified version of SpaceX's Starlink, is being operated by the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and reportedly uses frequencies that allow only low-bandwidth data transmission (closer to 3G cellular speeds).",
    "Experts like Kevin Gifford suggest the behavior may be intentional to obscure operations, or due to exploiting a rare quiet period in the frequency spectrum.",
    "The signal has been detected from 170 Starshield satellites, and the precise frequencies shift frequently, making detection and analysis difficult.",
    "While potential interference with other satellites exists, experts note no widespread disruptions have been confirmed yet, and the full impact remains unresolved.",
    "SpaceX and the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office have not responded to requests for comment on the issue.",
    "Amateur satellite trackers, such as Tilley, are raising awareness due to concerns about the implications of classified satellites operating in contested radio bands and potentially disrupting critical space-based systems."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A classified network of SpaceX satellites known as Starshield is emitting signals in the 2025–2110 MHz frequency band, which is normally reserved for Earth-to-satellite uplinks, not satellite-to-Earth downlinks. This usage violates international radio spectrum standards set by the International Telecommunication Union and could interfere with other scientific and commercial satellites. The signal was first detected by amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley in Canada during a routine scan, who noticed an unusual transmission in a normally quiet band. Experts like Kevin Gifford suggest the behavior may be intentional to obscure operations or due to exploiting a rare quiet period in the spectrum. The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office operates the Starshield network, having launched 11 satellites since May 2024, and the signal has been detected from 170 satellites. While interference has not been confirmed as widespread, the potential for disruption to legitimate satellite operations raises serious concerns, prompting calls for transparency and regulatory oversight.",
