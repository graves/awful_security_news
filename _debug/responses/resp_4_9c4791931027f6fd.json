    "A Slovak court convicted Juraj Cintula of terrorism and sentenced him to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, writer, and public activist, shot Fico five times during a public greeting in Handlova, leaving Fico seriously wounded.",
    "The court found that Cintula targeted the prime minister specifically, not a random citizen, which supported the terrorism charge over lesser charges of murder or assault.",
    "Cintula claimed the attack was intended to stop Fico's policies, which he said damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and stated he did not want to kill.",
    "The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia, particularly between Prime Minister Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the opposition’s calls for democratic reform and media freedom.",
    "Fico, who has held office since 2006, has been criticized for undermining media independence, overhauling public broadcasting, and ending state military aid to Ukraine.",
    "The opposition claims Fico has eroded democratic standards, while Fico blames the opposition for fueling societal anger that led to the attack.",
    "The sentence is less than the maximum of life in prison, indicating the court did not consider the case as falling under the most severe penalties.",
    "Cintula stated he would appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust,' and the defense argued that not every attack on an official constitutes terrorism.",
    "Judge Igor Kralik cited Cintula’s own justification for the attack when justifying the terrorism classification."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for terrorism charges related to an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024. The attack, which occurred in the central town of Handlova, left Fico seriously injured and sparked deep political and societal divisions. Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, which he said threatened Slovak freedom and culture. The court ruled that the attack was targeted specifically at the prime minister, supporting the terrorism charge over lesser offenses. The verdict reflects broader tensions in Slovakia between Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the opposition’s demands for democratic reform and media freedom. Fico has forgiven Cintula, while both the defense and prosecution emphasized the political and symbolic significance of the attack. The case underscores the risks of political polarization and the potential for violence in democratic societies.",
