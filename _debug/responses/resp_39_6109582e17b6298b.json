  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are experiencing heightened anxiety as US President Donald Trump threatens to impose tariffs and cut economic and military aid to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being a drug trafficker. Petro has responded with strong rebukes, calling Trump rude and ignorant. The feud, rooted in disagreements over drug trafficking and US intervention in the Caribbean, threatens Colombia’s economy—its largest trade partner is the US, which accounts for 30% of exports. Citizens fear job losses, business collapses, and restricted visa access. The $450 million in annual US aid for anti-drug efforts could be reduced, impacting both national security and economic stability. The conflict illustrates how political rhetoric between world leaders directly affects ordinary citizens' livelihoods and national well-being.",
