  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Elon Musk launched a public backlash against Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, calling him 'Sean Dummy' and accusing him of poor judgment, after Duffy suggested NASA might replace SpaceX in its $2.9 billion lunar lander contract due to scheduling delays. Musk defended SpaceX as the only U.S. company to successfully certify a new orbital space vehicle, while also supporting Jared Isaacman as a potential NASA administrator. The controversy underscores tensions between private space innovation and government oversight, particularly in the context of NASA’s Artemis III mission, which aims to land humans on the Moon by mid-2027 amid a global space race with China. Despite Duffy stating he has no interest in becoming NASA’s permanent leader and only supports vetting candidates, the debate reflects broader questions about agency independence, competition in space development, and political influence on science and technology policy.",
