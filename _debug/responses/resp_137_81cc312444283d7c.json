  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of diplomatic and military tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of enabling drug production, calling him an 'illegal drug leader' and threatening to cut U.S. aid and impose tariffs. The U.S. announced a military strike on a vessel linked to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian rebel group, and claimed it carried narcotics. Colombia rejected the accusations, with Petro accusing the U.S. of assassinating a civilian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, and asserting that the U.S. has violated national sovereignty. Despite Colombia's efforts to combat drug trafficking, including dismantling labs and seizures, the U.S. slashed aid to Colombia from over $700 million to around $230 million. Analysts warn that such actions could severely damage U.S.-Colombia cooperation and regional stability, especially as the U.S. intensifies military pressure in Latin America, including in Venezuela. The conflict reflects a deepening rift between a U.S. leadership that prioritizes anti-drug operations and a Colombian government that emphasizes sovereignty, peace, and social progress.",
