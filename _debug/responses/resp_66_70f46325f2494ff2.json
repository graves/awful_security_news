  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel, including judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents, is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed the standard Senate confirmation process. The Department of Justice argues that delegation of authority under the Attorney General’s power is a lawful and established method, especially when Senate nominations are blocked. However, legal advocates, including Abbe Lowell, contend that delegating full US attorney powers — including oversight, personnel decisions, and public roles — is unprecedented and unlawful. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, initially served as interim US attorney and was later designated as special attorney with full authority through delegation. The case has broader implications, as similar challenges are underway in Nevada and California, and it reflects a larger political standoff over congressional obstruction of appointments. The ruling may set a precedent for how future US attorney vacancies are filled, especially in the context of political gridlock.",
