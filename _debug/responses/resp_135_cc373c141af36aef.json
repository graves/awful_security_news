Despite progress in early-warning adoption, nearly half of all countries still lack adequate systems, with the majority of weather-related deaths occurring in developing nations. The article highlights real-world examples such as deadly floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, all occurring in 2025. It emphasizes that climate change is intensifying weather extremes, with a notable example being the successful evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten in May 2025 after a glacier collapse was predicted through monitoring. The WMO stresses that early warning systems are vital not just for alerting populations, but for enabling timely action to save lives and protect infrastructure, especially in vulnerable and conflict-affected regions.",
