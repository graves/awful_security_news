  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is urging global action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather, citing that nearly half of all countries lack sufficient capacity, especially in developing nations. Over the past 50 years, more than 2 million people have died due to weather-related disasters, with 90% of those deaths occurring in developing countries. The WMO acknowledges progress, with 108 countries now using some form of early-warning systems, but highlights that half still have only basic or inadequate systems. Real-world examples like the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, in May 2025 due to a monitored glacier collapse, underscore the life-saving potential of such systems. The article emphasizes that extreme weather events are escalating globally—impacting countries such as Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, southern Europe, and the United States—proving that no region is immune to climate change and reinforcing the urgent need for equitable, science-based early-warning networks worldwide.",
