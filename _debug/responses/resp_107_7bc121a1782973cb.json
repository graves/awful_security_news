  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced a new policy to de-register international humanitarian organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as supporting 'terrorist activities' or inciting 'racism'. The process, administered by COGAT, requires approval from a committee that includes Israeli officials from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. This move has effectively blocked major organizations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps from delivering aid, with some now in the appeal process. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and requests for entry are routinely denied. Israel has also banned UNRWA, the largest humanitarian provider in Gaza for decades, from sending aid, alleging ties to Hamas without providing evidence. The U.S. has ceased funding to UNRWA, deepening the crisis. Humanitarian officials warn that the restrictions are ideologically driven and not based on security needs, and that the resulting humanitarian situation in Gaza—already devastated by Israeli airstrikes—could lead to a full-scale famine.",
