  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early exposure to peanuts in infancy can prevent peanut allergies, new research shows a significant decline in allergy rates in the U.S. Since 2015, when guidelines recommended introducing peanuts to infants as early as four months, peanut allergy rates in children under age three have dropped by more than 27%, and by over 40% after expanded recommendations in 2017. A study by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, analyzing electronic health records, found that around 40,000 children who would have otherwise developed peanut allergies have avoided them. The LEAP trial, led by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, showed early allergen exposure reduces allergy risk by over 80%. Despite initial hesitancy among medical professionals—only about 29% of pediatricians followed the guidelines—adoption has grown, supported by advocacy from groups like FARE. Experts now recommend introducing allergens such as peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products between four and six months of age, with little or no prior screening. The findings highlight a measurable public health success in reducing the prevalence of life-threatening food allergies.",
