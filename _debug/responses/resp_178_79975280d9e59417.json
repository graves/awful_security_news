  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a dramatic daylight heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, four masked thieves stole high-value historical jewellery—worth €88 million—within less than eight minutes of the museum opening. The stolen items include a diamond and emerald necklace from Emperor Napoleon and a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, among other royal pieces. Using a modified truck with a mechanical lift and a battery-powered disc cutter, the thieves entered via the Galerie d'Apollon and threatened guards before fleeing on scooters. A damaged crown belonging to Empress Eugenie was found on their escape route. Security failures were identified, with one in three rooms lacking CCTV and the main alarm system failing to activate. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, condemned the heist as a serious attack on France's cultural heritage. Experts believe the stolen items were likely melted down and smuggled abroad, making recovery extremely difficult. The incident has prompted urgent security upgrades across France’s cultural institutions.",
