  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the current cultural surge of cowboy imagery across fashion, media, and politics, tracing its roots to 19th-century entertainment and political symbolism. It highlights how the cowboy has become a symbol of American patriotism, especially within conservative political movements, including the Trump administration and conservative media. While popularized through romanticized films and TV shows like 'Yellowstone' and '1923', the article argues that the image is a mythologized construct that obscures the true history of cowboys — many of whom were Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. The rise of Black cowboy culture, especially through Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour and Gabriela Hasbun’s photography, is acknowledged as a significant effort to correct this historical erasure. However, the article also notes that mainstream media and political discourse continue to rely on a whitewashed, idealized version of the cowboy, often omitting the harsh realities of labor, poverty, and environmental challenges. Ultimately, the article presents the cowboy as a cyclical cultural phenomenon shaped by politics, entertainment, and national identity, rather than a reflection of actual historical or social realities.",
