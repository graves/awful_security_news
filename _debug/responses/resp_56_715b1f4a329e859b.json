  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli officials have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage as those of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, who was killed during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Haimi, a 41-year-old military officer, is the 13th deceased hostage to be returned under the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal signed on October 9, 2025. The identification follows a complex process involving the Red Cross and Israeli forensic teams, and comes amid ongoing diplomatic pressure from the US, particularly President Donald Trump, who has warned of 'eradication' if Hamas fails to comply. Hamas has faced criticism for delays and a previous misidentification of a non-Israeli body, raising concerns about the accuracy and completeness of body recovery. Israeli military and political leaders, including Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, insist the return of all deceased hostages is a non-negotiable part of the ceasefire. The situation highlights both the humanitarian toll and the political fragility of the ceasefire efforts in Gaza.",
