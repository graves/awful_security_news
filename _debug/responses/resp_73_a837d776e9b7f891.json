  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 23-year-old Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, went missing on October 4, 2025, after disconnecting from her phone and social media at her workplace. Two weeks later, human remains of an unidentified female were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school, prompting police to investigate. Authorities identified Keon King, a 21-year-old man, as the suspect based on phone tracking and his prior criminal history involving a domestic kidnapping. King is charged with Scott’s kidnapping and with a previous case where he allegedly assaulted and kidnapped a woman. A public tip led investigators to a gold 1999 Toyota Camry believed to be connected to King, which was later found in a parking lot. The case is being investigated by the Philadelphia Police Department’s homicide division with assistance from the FBI’s Violent Crime Task Force. The remains are now under examination by the medical examiner to determine if they belong to Kada Scott. The family has expressed deep anguish and is urging the public to come forward with any information. Officials emphasize that this case may represent a pattern of behavior by King, and that every piece of information—no matter how small—could be crucial to solving it.",
