  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement. The return comes as Israel faces growing frustration over the slow and incomplete recovery of all hostage remains, with Israeli officials accusing Hamas of holding some bodies as leverage. Despite Hamas claiming to have returned all accessible remains, Israeli intelligence suspects Hamas may not have located all victims, and that some remain hidden. Meanwhile, the ceasefire is strained by Israeli military actions, including the killing of a Palestinian family crossing the ceasefire line, and by the ongoing closure of the Rafah border crossing, which severely restricts humanitarian aid. Aid organizations like the World Food Programme report difficulties in delivering food due to poor infrastructure and limited access. Negotiations on Phase Two of the ceasefire, focused on Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and a proposed international stabilization force, are underway in Egypt. The Trump administration's 20-point plan proposes a technocratic Palestinian government and an ISF chaired by Donald Trump, though Hamas remains vague on disarmament and power transfer, and countries are still negotiating ISF participation with demands for UN Security Council approval.",
