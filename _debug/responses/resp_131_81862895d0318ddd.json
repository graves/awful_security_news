  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and advisor to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s education secretaries, founded the National Education Equity Lab in 2019 with a $50,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The initiative, now known as the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), brings college-level courses from 17 elite universities—including Harvard—directly into Title I high schools. Over five years, NEON has delivered over 40,000 courses to students across 33 states, with 80% of students passing. NEON students are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges and persist in college compared to peers, addressing the systemic inequity where elite universities remain underrepresented by low-income students. Despite limited funding—only $7.5 million in 2024 and 32 full-time staff—NEON has gained support from major foundations and individuals like Henry McCance. The program has expanded to all Title I schools in Jackson, Mississippi, and 120 in New York City, and aims to serve 1 million students in 10 years. NEON’s model, which builds student confidence and college readiness through direct access to elite coursework, is seen as a more effective alternative to the failing Advanced Placement system, particularly for students from rural, poor, and marginalized communities.",
