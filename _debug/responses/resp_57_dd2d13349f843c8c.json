  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors from the Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald, James Comey’s lead defense attorney, claiming he may have been involved in the improper dissemination of classified information in 2017. The dispute arises from allegations that Comey used Fitzgerald to share unclassified memos about his interactions with President Trump, which the government later claims were upclassified. Fitzgerald denies these allegations, asserting that the memos were unclassified at the time of sharing and that no classified information was disclosed. The case raises significant ethical and legal questions about a lawyer’s ability to represent a client when they were also a witness to or participant in the events being investigated. Legal experts note that a person cannot serve as both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case, adding to the controversy.",
