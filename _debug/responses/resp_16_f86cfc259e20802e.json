  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Louvre Museum heist marks a significant escalation in museum crime, as thieves used industrial tools to breach the Apollo Gallery during daylight hours, stealing Napoleonic jewels and damaging the crown of Empress Eugénie. This incident reflects a broader shift from stealing culturally valuable artworks to targeting artifacts with high material value — such as jewelry and coins — for resale or melting. The heist is linked to prior attacks in Paris, including the Natural History Museum and Limoges museum, suggesting a pattern or organized criminal network. Experts, including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath, warn of a growing trend of 'grab-and-go' thefts enabled by museum openness and weak security. The robbery has sparked national outrage in France, with officials like Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticizing security failures. Interpol has added the stolen artifacts to its database, indicating international concern. The event is seen as a form of 'cultural terrorism' — not for cultural loss, but for financial gain through material extraction, signaling a serious threat to global cultural heritage.",
