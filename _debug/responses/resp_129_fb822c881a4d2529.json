  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Due to a government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was unable to participate in IDWeek, the nation’s largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts. This disruption, which prevented hundreds of researchers—including CDC scientists—from attending, has serious implications for public health, especially as measles and whooping cough surge. The Trump administration's policies, including funding cuts, furloughs, and restrictions on CDC scientific participation, have hampered vital research sharing and collaboration. Experts like Michael Osterholm are now stepping in to fill the gap by launching open-access publications and forming private-sector research partnerships. The situation raises concerns that critical public health information may be suppressed, undermining efforts to combat emerging threats such as bird flu, superbugs, and HIV.",
