  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A hard-hitting report from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, released on October 16, 2025, criticizes the Catholic Church’s decades-long failure to respond adequately to sexual abuse allegations, especially involving clergy. The report highlights ongoing trauma for survivors due to dismissal, denial, and retaliation, and calls for reparations, transparency, and reforms. It singles out Italy for cultural resistance and lack of cooperation, and Africa for weak safeguarding protocols and resistance to accountability. The report urges the Vatican to improve transparency in resignations linked to abuse and to strengthen anti-abuse policies—especially in developing nations—through greater investment and better vetting of candidates. The findings are grounded in survivor testimonies and expert analysis, with the commission led by Archbishop Thibault Verny and compiled by former UN Special Rapporteur Maud de Boer-Buquicchio. The report marks a key moment under Pope Leo XIV, who has committed to embedding a culture of prevention and accountability throughout the Church.",
