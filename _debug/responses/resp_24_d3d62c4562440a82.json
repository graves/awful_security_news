Passengers, including Henry Gruver and his family, were unaware of the issue until police boarded the aircraft. The FAA and SkyWest identified a malfunction in the flight crew’s inter-phone system as the root cause. The flight eventually took off again five hours late, resulting in the family missing their connection to Japan and having to wait overnight at the airport. No further communication has been made by either airline to affected passengers.",
