  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Ukrainian drones struck the Orenburg gas processing plant in southern Russia, damaging a key facility operated by Gazprom and disrupting gas intake from Kazakhstan. The attack has been linked to Ukraine’s broader strategy of targeting Russian energy infrastructure to weaken the war effort. In retaliation, Russian forces reportedly launched 62 drones into Ukraine, with several strikes occurring near Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, including a long-range rocket bomb attack on Lozava, raising concerns about civilian casualties. Ukrainian officials claim to have also damaged Russia’s Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested in a Fox News interview that Ukraine may need to give up territory in exchange for peace, marking a significant shift from previous support for Ukrainian territorial restoration. Trump also declined to commit to supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, citing U.S. defense needs. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, with talks between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy expected in Hungary, though no major breakthroughs are anticipated.",
