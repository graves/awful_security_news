  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean were to be repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador for detention and prosecution. The strike, which targeted a vessel believed to be transporting large quantities of fentanyl and other narcotics, resulted in at least 29 deaths, including one additional fatality reported. Trump justified the action by framing it as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, invoking the legal authority used during the post-9/11 war on terrorism. Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed the safe return of a Colombian national and pledged prosecution. Ecuador has not confirmed repatriation plans. The operation has drawn bipartisan criticism from Congress over lack of transparency and legal concerns, including the classification of traffickers as enemy combatants and potential violations of international law. Simultaneously, the Trump administration has authorized covert actions in Venezuela, reportedly targeting President Nicolás Maduro, who has offered resource stakes to avoid U.S. pressure, raising broader geopolitical tensions.",
