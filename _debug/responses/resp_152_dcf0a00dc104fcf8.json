  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), led by the World Health Organization and including the Gates Foundation, faces a critical $1.7 billion funding shortfall through 2029, driven primarily by reduced foreign aid from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This financial strain threatens ongoing polio eradication efforts, especially in high-risk regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan, which continue to report wild polio cases. To address the shortfall, the GPEI will prioritize surveillance and vaccination in vulnerable areas, adopt cost-effective strategies such as fractional dosing, and collaborate with other health programs like measles initiatives. While polio cases have declined since 2024, persistent transmission and vaccine-derived outbreaks in places like Nigeria highlight the ongoing challenges. Experts stress that sustained global commitment and funding are essential to achieving polio eradication.",
