Moynihan, who was previously sentenced to 21 months in prison for breaching the Capitol, was among the first rioters to break through police lines and take photos from a Senate desk. His arrest and the broader context of recent political violence — including killings of Democratic lawmakers and conservative activists — highlight deepening concerns about the safety of elected officials and the consequences of pardoning violent rioters. This incident underscores the ongoing tension between political accountability and executive leniency in the wake of civil unrest.",
