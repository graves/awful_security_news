  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s interim president, Jose Jeri, has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital, Lima, following weeks of antigovernment protests driven by Gen-Z activists over corruption and rising organized crime. The move allows military deployment and suspension of constitutional rights, including freedom of assembly. The emergency follows the removal of former President Dina Boluarte after impeachment, and comes amid a surge in extortion cases—estimated at 18,000 this year—linked to a 30% increase from the previous year and a rise in homicides. A prior state of emergency under Boluarte in March 2025 failed to curb crime after the murder of singer Paul Flores, highlighting the challenges of addressing crime through emergency measures. The lack of clarity in how intelligence will be gathered to combat extortion raises transparency concerns. Protests turned violent on Thursday, resulting in one death and 100 injuries, including police and journalists, and Jeri has affirmed he will not resign.",
