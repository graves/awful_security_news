    "Guatemala’s garment factories, known as 'maquilas,' employ tens of thousands of workers, primarily women, and supply garments to major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren.",
    "The sector contributes nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP and has been crucial during the pandemic, especially due to US nearshoring efforts.",
    "Workers face extreme working conditions, including daily quotas of thousands of garments, 15-hour shifts, minimal wages (less than $500/month), dirty water, and sexual harassment.",
    "Korean companies control nearly two-thirds of investments in Guatemala’s textile industry, acting as key intermediaries in the supply chain.",
    "US brands like Ralph Lauren and Target do not have formal contracts with workers and are legally unaccountable for labor abuses, relying on sub-contracting arrangements.",
    "Workers report widespread threats, violence, and suppression of union activity, including threats of violence against union leaders like Anastacio Tzib Caal, who was shot dead, and harassment of union members.",
    "Labor inspectors face obstruction from factory management, and union members are often dismissed after raising concerns, leaving workers with little recourse.",
    "The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, raised the minimum wage by 6% in 2024 and pledged reform, but enforcement remains weak due to systemic corruption and power imbalances.",
    "The future of maquila workers is uncertain due to US import tariffs and the growing recognition of a 'gendered supply chain shock,' where women are disproportionately affected.",
    "Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra have experienced job loss, pension theft, and psychological trauma, with severance funds often delayed or provided only through third-party payments like $3.3 million from Sae-A Trading, which is not legally responsible."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the hidden labor conditions in Guatemala's garment factories, known as 'maquilas,' where thousands of women work under extreme conditions for US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite the sector contributing nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP and rising due to nearshoring policies, workers face daily quotas, minimal wages, sexual harassment, dirty water, and threats of violence. Korean companies dominate the industry, with little accountability from US brands that rely on sub-contracting. Workers report being silenced, union leaders are targeted, and labor inspections are blocked by factory management. A key case involves Rutilia Cano, a 23-year worker who lost her job and pension after factory bankruptcy, and Alexandra, who endured years of sexual harassment. The Guatemalan government under President Bernardo Arévalo has raised wages and pledged reform, but enforcement remains weak. The article highlights the lack of legal responsibility for US brands and the systemic power imbalance between workers and management, with global supply chain policies like US import tariffs adding further uncertainty for workers.",
