  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenny Loggins has objected to the use of his song 'Danger Zone' from the 'Top Gun' film in a social media video posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social, depicting Trump dumping excrement from a fighter jet during 'No Kings' protests. Loggins claims he was not asked for permission and criticizes the video as divisive and aimed at tearing society apart. The video, which draws on music from a 1986 film featuring Tom Cruise, remained active on Truth Social as of Tuesday morning. This incident follows a pattern of Trump using AI-generated videos with music from popular songs—including Blue Oyster Cult’s 'Don’t Fear the Reaper'—to promote political messaging, sparking backlash from musicians like Adele and Bruce Springsteen. The 'No Kings' protests, held nationwide, are a response to perceived authoritarian policies by Trump, which he dismisses as a 'joke'.",
