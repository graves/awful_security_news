  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits individuals with a history of drug use from possessing firearms, centering on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for marijuana and cocaine use at his home. The Trump administration defends the law, claiming habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially during police encounters, and cites alleged ties to Iran. However, Hemani’s legal team argues the law lacks historical grounding and is inconsistent with the trend of marijuana legalization in nearly half of U.S. states. The case builds on a 2022 Supreme Court precedent requiring gun prohibitions to have historical roots and contrasts with prior rulings that upheld bans for domestic abuse victims. The case is politically charged, as President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned. The Court is expected to hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026, marking a pivotal moment in Second Amendment jurisprudence.",
