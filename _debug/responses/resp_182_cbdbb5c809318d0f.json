  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a massive Russian assault involving over 100 Iranian-made Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles, the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv experienced a complete blackout, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The attack, which also killed four civilians and injured ten, including a 10-year-old girl, targeted civilian infrastructure such as power plants and water pumping stations. Officials, including Deputy Head Andriy Podorvan, describe a pattern of increased strikes on energy and civilian facilities in the past six months, with no clear military justification. Despite the severity, Ukrainian residents maintain high morale, using back-up generators and mutual aid. The broader concern is that sustained attacks are eroding Ukraine’s energy resilience and economy, with estimated infrastructure damage exceeding $16 billion. International cooperation, especially from US energy companies, is helping Ukraine restore power, though limited equipment supply and long production times delay recovery.",
