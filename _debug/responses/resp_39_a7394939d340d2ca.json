  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As artificial intelligence drives a surge in data center demand, companies and researchers are exploring space-based computing as a solution to energy and land constraints. With data center power demand projected to rise 165% by 2030, initiatives like the European ASCEND project and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are testing small-scale space-based computing systems. These efforts aim to leverage continuous solar energy and avoid terrestrial carbon emissions, though significant challenges remain — including heat dissipation, radiation effects, launch costs, and space debris risks. While proponents believe space-based data centers will become essential within a decade due to terrestrial resource exhaustion, experts like Quentin A. Parker question their economic and practical feasibility, noting current terrestrial solutions remain cheaper and more reliable. The article highlights both the technological ambition and the skepticism surrounding the future of space-based data centers.",
