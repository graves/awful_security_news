The most affected areas are central and southeastern states like Hidalgo, Puebla, Queretaro, and Veracruz, where landslides, road collapses, and power outages have displaced tens of thousands. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range was especially vulnerable due to its topography. The Mexican government deployed over 8,700 military and 3,300 navy personnel, along with emergency supplies, to assist with evacuations and aid. A return of the La Niña climate pattern is believed to have intensified rainfall, contributing to record-breaking precipitation, including in Mexico City. The situation is ongoing, with Raymond expected to make landfall in southern Baja California by the weekend.",
