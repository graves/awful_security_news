  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow deployment of the National Guard to Chicago to address protests against ICE enforcement, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that upheld similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that the protests constitute 'violent resistance' and invokes the 1827 precedent in Martin v. Mott to assert that the president alone has the authority to determine exigent circumstances. In contrast, Illinois officials and federal judges, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, challenge the characterization of protests as riots, asserting that local law enforcement has handled the situation effectively and that the current situation differs substantially from the wartime context of Martin v. Mott. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision quickly, with implications that could extend to future National Guard deployments across the United States.",
