  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a global call to action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capacity. With climate change intensifying weather disasters, the WMO reports that over 2 million people have died from weather-related hazards in the past 50 years, with 90% of deaths occurring in developing nations. Despite progress—such as an increase from 52 to 108 countries using early warning systems—the assessment reveals that half of 62 assessed countries still have only basic or insufficient systems, especially in fragile or conflict-affected regions. The article highlights real-world examples, including the May 2025 evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a predicted glacier collapse, and widespread disasters such as floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the U.S., underscoring the urgent need for global investment in early-warning infrastructure to save lives and protect infrastructure.",
