  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump and supported by US envoys JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, is progressing better than expected, according to Vance during a visit to Israel. Despite renewed violence on 2025-10-21—triggered by a Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers—Israel and the US maintain that the truce is holding. Hamas faces pressure to disarm and return all deceased hostages, with Israel insisting that this is a prerequisite for peace talks. As of October 2025, 13 of 28 Israeli hostage bodies have been returned, and 20 living hostages have been released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian aid delivery through the WFP is severely constrained, with only two crossings open and a dire food situation in northern Gaza. The US and Israel are pushing for negotiations on the next phase of a 20-point peace plan, including an interim Palestinian government, international force deployment, troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. Meanwhile, Hamas chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya confirms commitment to the ceasefire, though challenges remain in recovering bodies due to structural and logistical limitations.",
