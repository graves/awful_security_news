  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power, water, and heating infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, causing widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned these attacks as deliberate efforts to terrorize civilians through cold and prolonged suffering, and responded by urging European allies to increase military and financial support, including using frozen Russian assets to fund critical air defense systems. Ukraine has also launched retaliatory strikes, such as on the Russian Bryansk Chemical Plant, while remaining concerned about U.S. policy shifts under Donald Trump, especially regarding possible diplomatic meetings with Vladimir Putin in Budapest. Analysts note a pattern in which Russian aggression increases when U.S. pressure on Russia wanes, and Ukraine continues to assert its commitment to peace on the battlefield, with Zelensky calling for a ceasefire based on the current line of contact.",
