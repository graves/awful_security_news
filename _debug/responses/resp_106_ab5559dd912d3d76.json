  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense to return books discussing race and gender to school libraries on military bases after students filed claims that their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed under policies from President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. These policies, including executive orders targeting 'gender ideology' and 'discriminatory equity ideology,' led to the removal of books on topics like LGBTQ+ pride, racism, and sexual identity, as well as the cancellation of cultural and historical events such as Black History Month and Holocaust Remembrance Day. The ACLU filed a legal motion supporting the students, arguing that the removals were politically motivated, not pedagogically sound. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the actions were rooted in improper partisan motives and mandated the immediate restoration of the removed materials, affirming the importance of free speech in public education.",
