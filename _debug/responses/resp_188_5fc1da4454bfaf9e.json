  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s first former president to go to jail, begins a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 presidential campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. While cleared of personally receiving the funds, he was convicted of criminal association with aides Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, who arranged secret meetings with Libyan intelligence officials in 2005 through intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine. Sarkozy is currently held in isolation at La Santé prison, where he faces restricted contact, limited exercise, and emotional distress. He has appealed the conviction, claiming he is an innocent man being punished for political revenge. French leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have expressed public support, with Darmanin pledging to visit him. The case remains highly controversial, and France’s highest administrative court will deliver a verdict on the appeal in late November 2025.",
