  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the U.S., including volunteers from New York, participated in an annual citizen lobby day in Washington, D.C., to urge Congress to prioritize cancer research funding, expand access to cancer screening, and retain health insurance subsidies. Despite deep political divisions—such as Mary Catherine Johnson’s support for Donald Trump and Lexy Mealing’s Democratic affiliation—participants emphasized that cancer transcends political boundaries. The event took place during a federal government shutdown, highlighting the urgency of health policy in a politically divided environment. Volunteers wore matching blue polo shirts, delivered personal narratives, and visited 484 congressional offices. While some Republican lawmakers resisted subsidies, both parties supported increased research funding and screening access. A candlelight vigil on the National Mall honored 10,000 individuals affected by cancer, emphasizing unity and empathy. The story underscores how shared personal experience with cancer can foster bipartisan cooperation and bridge political divides in a time of national division.",
