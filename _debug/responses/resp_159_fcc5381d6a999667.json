  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, using hundreds of modified drones and missiles to conduct precise attacks, including a devastating strike on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 on October 10. This marks a shift from earlier attacks to a targeted strategy aimed at crippling power and heating during the expected harsh winter. Russian missile modifications have reduced interception rates from 37% to 6%, while corruption in Ukraine’s anti-drone procurement has undermined defense efforts. As a result, Ukraine’s energy systems face near-collapse, forcing civilians to prepare with generators, batteries, and alternative fuels. Analysts warn that without better protection and accountability, Ukraine may face unprecedented winter hardships.",
