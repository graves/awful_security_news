The Blue Jays’ strong offensive performance, especially in the ALDS against the Yankees, and their ability to overcome a 2-0 deficit, marks a significant turnaround from their 2024 performance. The Los Angeles Dodgers, meanwhile, are the most successful team in recent years with a record of two World Series titles and five NL pennants, and they are poised to become the first repeat champions in 25 years. The Dodgers’ postseason dominance, including a standout performance by Shohei Ohtani in the NLCS, makes them a formidable opponent. However, the Dodgers’ bullpen has shown vulnerabilities, creating a potential opportunity for the Blue Jays to exploit. Game 1 of the World Series is set for Friday, October 24, in Toronto.",
