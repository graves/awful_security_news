  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, many national parks remain partially open due to state funding and critical operations, despite the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees. Tourists like Nudrat Mahajabin continue visiting parks such as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite, but the absence of rangers and fee collection has led to unregulated behavior, including drone flights and base jumping, raising safety concerns. Advocacy groups like the National Parks Conservation Association and the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks warn that limited staffing compromises visitor safety, emergency response, and environmental integrity. In West Virginia, parks are kept open through Bridge Day using state funds to protect tourism revenue. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., closures of Smithsonian museums have led to a surge in visitors to nearby private museums and an increase in public transit usage, but Destination DC warns of significant economic losses due to disrupted tourism. Local businesses report mixed impacts, with some unaffected and others facing drops in bookings. Volunteers are now cleaning up trash in parks like Rocky Mountain National Park, indicating long-term environmental consequences of sustained unregulated access.",
