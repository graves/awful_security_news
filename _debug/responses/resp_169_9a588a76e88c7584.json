  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks targeted Khartoum international airport and surrounding areas in Sudan on October 21, 2025, just one day before its long-awaited reopening. The attacks, reportedly using suicide drones and attributed to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), involved over eight blasts and caused significant concern for the airport’s safety and recovery. The airport has been closed since April 2023 due to conflict damage, and its reopening was a key milestone in Sudan’s post-conflict recovery. Despite the Sudanese army reclaiming control of the capital earlier in 2025, drone strikes have persisted, threatening ongoing reconstruction and civilian stability. The RSF continues to target military and civilian infrastructure, including army bases in Omdurman, and threatens to seize el-Fasher in Darfur—a move that could lead to ethnic violence and further destabilize the country. The wider conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, over 12 million displaced people, and the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises, highlighting the global significance of Sudan’s ongoing war.",
