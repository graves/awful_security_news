    "Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing it was necessary to avoid a 'crapshoot' trial due to evidentiary weaknesses and jurisdictional uncertainty.",
    "Acosta claimed that many victims refused to testify, had inconsistent stories, and that the lack of evidence of interstate travel or co-conspirators made a federal trial unlikely.",
    "The plea deal resulted in Epstein serving only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges, which critics labeled a 'sweetheart deal' or 'deal of a lifetime'.",
    "Acosta stated he objected to Epstein’s work release program, which allowed him to be outside jail during business hours, and expressed frustration at the decision by the Palm Beach sheriff.",
    "Acosta emphasized that the decision to settle the case was made jointly by prosecutors across his office, not unilaterally by him, and that the goal was to ensure Epstein would go to jail.",
    "Acosta denied any knowledge or involvement in interviews of Donald Trump regarding Epstein, stating that such decisions are outside the role of a U.S. attorney.",
