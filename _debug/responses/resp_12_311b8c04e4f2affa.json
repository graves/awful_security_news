The rebels confiscated all communication equipment, including phones and servers, and have repeatedly accused UN staff of espionage, which the UN has denied. This incident follows a similar raid on another UN facility and part of a broader, sustained crackdown across Sanaa, Hodeida, and Saada province, where over 50 UN staff have been detained and one WFP worker died in detention earlier this year. The UN has suspended operations in Saada and relocated its top humanitarian coordinator to Aden. The organization is urgently working with the Houthis and other parties to resolve the crisis, restore control over facilities, and ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel.",
