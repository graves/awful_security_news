  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America have intensified in recent years, with Madagascar serving as a pivotal case study. In 2025, Gen Z protesters in Madagascar toppled President Andry Rajoelina, who was initially installed via military intervention in 2009. The movement succeeded through a convergence of youth mobilization via social media and military action, with power now held by army commander Michael Randrianirina. Similar movements have occurred in Bangladesh (2024), Nepal (2025), and Sri Lanka (2022), demonstrating a global trend of Gen Z political activism driven by dissatisfaction with governance, corruption, and economic hardship. Experts like Kingsley Moghalu and Swikani Ncube warn that African leaders are increasingly at risk due to the continent's young, politically assertive population and high youth unemployment. While some leaders like President Ruto of Kenya have challenged critics, others like President Museveni of Uganda have responded with repression. The success in Madagascar may inspire renewed or revived protests in suppressed movements, such as in Kenya and Mozambique. This trend underscores a broader challenge: the failure of African governance to deliver basic services and jobs, which has empowered youth to take political action using technology and collective voice.",
