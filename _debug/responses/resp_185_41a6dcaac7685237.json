Sarkozy is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, where he has limited contact and is denied public interaction. He has appealed his conviction, arguing it is unjust and that France has been humiliated by a desire for revenge. The case has sparked national debate over political accountability, the ethics of foreign funding, and the treatment of former leaders in the justice system. A final verdict on his appeal is expected from France’s highest administrative court in late November 2025.",
