  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is facing mounting legal and political scrutiny over its decision to release two survivors from a failed strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean. Despite claiming the individuals were 'narco-terrorists' posing an imminent threat to American lives, the administration chose not to detain or prosecute them, instead releasing them to Colombia and Ecuador. This action contradicts the narrative of an active war against drug traffickers and raises serious legal concerns, including the lack of public evidence, absence of congressional authorization, and potential violation of due process. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro, experts like Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, and lawmakers such as Senator Todd Young, have challenged the administration's claims and the legality of the operations. The decision appears to be a strategic avoidance of legal accountability, undermining the administration’s narrative and exposing deep flaws in its justification for using military force without democratic oversight.",
