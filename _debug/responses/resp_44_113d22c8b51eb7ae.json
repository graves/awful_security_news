  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, especially in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes over the past month. These attacks, which include a deadly strike in Novhorod-Siverskyi and damage to critical energy facilities, are seen as a deliberate tactic to terrorize civilians and prolong suffering. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes the strategy to Russia’s aim of ‘killing people and terrorizing them with cold,’ and responds with both enhanced air defenses and retaliatory missile strikes on Russian facilities such as the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Despite expectations of U.S. support, Ukraine remains short on air defense capabilities and is now turning to Europe for military and financial aid. The European Union is exploring the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at around $200 billion—as a loan to fund Ukraine’s war effort, with Germany proposing a 140-billion euro loan. This initiative is met with resistance from Russia, which calls it an illegal seizure. Meanwhile, the possibility of a summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban raises concerns among Ukrainian officials about diplomatic manipulation. Analysts note a pattern where shifts in Western rhetoric—such as Donald Trump’s tone—trigger Russian aggressive tactics, indicating a complex interplay of diplomatic and military strategy.",
