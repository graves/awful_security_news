  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has withstood its first major test, with both sides reaffirming their commitment despite escalating tensions. Following the killing of two Israeli soldiers in Gaza—Major Yaniv Kula and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz—Israel launched airstrikes that killed at least 44 people, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire by attacking forces in Rafah. Hamas denied involvement, claimed to have found another Israeli hostage, and stated it remains committed to the agreement. The Israeli military and Hamas both accuse each other of breaches, including violations of the Yellow Line and delays in returning hostages. Aid deliveries have continued into Gaza, though the Rafah crossing remains closed. Key US officials, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have arrived to support implementation, and US Vice President JD Vance is set to visit. Domestic pressure in Israel, particularly from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, criticizes Israel’s aid continuation as a 'backdown.' Meanwhile, internal conflicts in Gaza—including Hamas’s security campaign and alleged attacks by Israel-backed militias—have deepened the fragile security situation, raising serious doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ceasefire.",
