  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. district judge, Phyllis Hamilton, has ruled that Israeli spyware company NSO Group must be barred from targeting WhatsApp users, citing that its software causes irreparable harm by undermining the core promise of privacy in encrypted messaging. The decision stems from a six-year lawsuit filed by Meta in 2019, which accused NSO of reverse-engineering WhatsApp to deploy Pegasus spyware on users' phones, including through zero-click attacks and repeated design evasions to bypass security. The judge found that NSO’s conduct is ongoing and damaging, thus granting a broad injunction specifically for WhatsApp. However, the court reduced the initial $168 million damages award to $4 million, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to deem the conduct 'particularly egregious' in the context of smartphone-era surveillance. The ruling does not extend to Meta’s other platforms due to lack of evidence, and it establishes a precedent that digital surveillance firms face legal consequences when exploiting encrypted services for unauthorized targeting of civil society members.",
