  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the planet will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerously hot weather. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days projected under a pre-Paris 4°C warming scenario, but still indicates severe climate risks. The study reveals a stark global inequity: small island nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—accounting for less than 1% of global emissions—are expected to face the largest increases in heat exposure, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 additional superhot days. Experts warn that this disparity may deepen global inequalities and spark future geopolitical instability, emphasizing that climate change is not just a scientific issue but a moral and social one affecting billions.",
