  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of scams using AI-generated voices have targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, including impersonations of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, who was falsely contacted by a deepfake voice asking for a $1.17 million transfer. These scams, which gained momentum after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's release of journalist Cecilia Sala, have become increasingly sophisticated, with AI voice cloning technology now producing voices indistinguishable from real ones. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voices were frequently mistaken for authentic, and participants often rated them as more trustworthy. Global losses from such scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. AI-generated deepfakes are also being used to create non-consensual sexual content, including child abuse material, prompting legal actions in the US and Australia. While AI has promising applications such as helping people who have lost their voice, the rise of deepfakes poses a significant threat to personal identity, financial security, and public trust.",
