  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. jury has ruled that French bank BNP Paribas is complicit in atrocities in Sudan by facilitating the regime of former leader Omar al-Bashir through financial services such as letters of credit that enabled exports and revenue generation. The plaintiffs—two men and one woman, all now American citizens—described severe torture, including burning, slashing, and sexual assault, which they claim were made possible by the regime’s financial sustainability. The jury awarded $20.75 million in damages, asserting that BNP Paribas’s operations were a ‘natural and adequate cause’ of the harm. While BNP Paribas denies liability, citing legal operations and lack of knowledge of human rights abuses, the verdict follows a prior $8.97 billion penalty for sanctions violations and the U.S. recognition of the conflict as genocide. The case underscores growing pressure on global financial institutions to account for their role in supporting authoritarian regimes and enabling mass violence.",
