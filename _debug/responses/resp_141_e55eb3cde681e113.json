  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added types—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—plus seven previously restricted ones. These controls, effective from December 1, 2025, apply not only to the metals themselves but also to specialized refining equipment. The Chinese government justifies the move on national security grounds, citing foreign entities' use of Chinese rare-earth materials for military applications. The move occurs just weeks before a high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The US, the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruptions in its defense sector—including for F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI technologies—while also affecting civilian technologies such as electric vehicles and smartphones. Analysts interpret the action as a signaling maneuver to assert China’s dominance in the global rare-earth supply chain. Exemptions exist for emergency medical, public health, and disaster relief purposes, ensuring humanitarian access. This development underscores the deep interdependence and strategic tension between the US and China in critical technological and supply chains.",
