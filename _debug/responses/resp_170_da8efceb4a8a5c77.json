  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly financing illegal deforestation and land grabs in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. The report highlights critical gaps in JBS’s supply chain, including the lack of tracking for indirect suppliers and the use of group-level animal transit permits (GTA) that cannot trace individual animals. This enables a 'laundering' system where illegally deforested cattle are transferred to JBS facilities without transparency. Despite past promises, such as the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement, JBS has failed to implement full traceability, and experts argue that the current timeline for national tracking systems—by 2026 in Pará and 2032 federally—is too slow. The situation is compounded by fraudulent land registrations, violence against Indigenous communities, and systemic weaknesses in Brazil’s animal movement data. The report calls for immediate, enforceable federal traceability mechanisms and public access to GTA data to hold companies accountable and halt deforestation.",
