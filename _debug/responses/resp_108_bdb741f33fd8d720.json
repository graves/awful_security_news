  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a seven-mile-long artificial reef off its coast, combining marine science and art to restore a historic coral habitat lost in the 1970s. Led by marine biologist Colin Foord and arts curator Ximena Caminos, the project includes 22 concrete cars arranged in an underwater traffic jam that will serve as coral substrates, eventually being covered by growing gorgonian and other soft corals. Designed as both an ecological restoration and an underwater tourist attraction, Reefline is accessible to the public via swimming at shallow depths and aims to bring back a natural marine ecosystem that once existed in the area. The project is funded by a $5 million city bond and seeks $6 million in additional public funding, with a marine learning center planned to educate visitors. A future phase involving 57 giant starfish sculptures may one day become a cultural symbol of the city, reflecting the broader mission of using art to revitalize communities and protect the environment.",
