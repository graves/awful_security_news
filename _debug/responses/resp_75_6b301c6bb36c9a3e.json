  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite President Donald Trump's call for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue to advance in Ukraine, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and drones—particularly targeting Ukrainian military positions and energy infrastructure. Key areas of conflict include Kupiansk, Vovchansk, and Pokrovsk, where Russian advances are met with strong Ukrainian resistance and counterattacks. While Russia has gained approximately 120 square miles of territory, Ukrainian commanders maintain that Russia lacks strategic initiative, and the conflict remains stalled with no sign of a ceasefire. Russia has suffered massive casualties, prompting changes in recruitment policies, such as reducing sign-on bonuses. Ukraine is countering with long-range strikes on Russian energy facilities, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Analysts note that Russia’s improved battlefield tactics and increased drone use have turned a weakness into strength, while the Kremlin remains unwilling to negotiate, suggesting a prolonged and costly conflict with no immediate resolution.",
