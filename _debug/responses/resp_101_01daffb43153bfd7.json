  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under the Biden-Harris administration, has publicly stepped away from the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing deep internal disunity, disloyalty, and failure to anticipate the 2024 election outcome. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she recounts how the June 2024 presidential debate revealed public concerns about President Biden’s health, which were amplified by Democratic figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney. She argues that the party’s inability to unify behind Biden—despite his successful four-year presidency—was a critical factor in the 2024 defeat. Jean-Pierre also highlights structural biases against her as a Black woman in the press secretary role and the political loyalty and marginalization of Black women and other marginalized communities. Ultimately, her decision to identify as an independent is not a rejection of the party, but a call for accountability, transparency, and a reimagining of American politics beyond partisan loyalty, especially in light of initiatives like Project 2025 and the erosion of DEI policies.",
