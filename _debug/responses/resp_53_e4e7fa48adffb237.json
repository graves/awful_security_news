  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel, including judges appointed by Reagan, Bush, and Obama, is evaluating the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed Senate confirmation. The Department of Justice argues that delegation of authority by the Attorney General is a lawful and established practice, citing precedents such as a Biden administration attorney serving in a senior role without confirmation. However, critics, including legal counsel Abbe Lowell, argue that full US attorney powers—such as oversight of investigations and personnel—cannot be delegated and that the process is unprecedented and unconstitutional. The case has broader implications, with similar appointments in Nevada and California under legal challenge. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, has claimed that Congress’s obstruction of nominations has undermined the president’s authority. The ruling could reshape how executive branch appointments are made and set a precedent for future vacancies in federal positions.",
