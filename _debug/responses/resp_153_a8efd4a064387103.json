  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A general strike and mass protests in Tunisia’s southern city of Gabes, led by the powerful UGTT labour union, have shut down economic activity in response to severe environmental pollution from the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents blame the plant—opened in 1972—for widespread health problems, including respiratory illness and cancer, as well as ecological collapse, such as poisoned marine life and contaminated crops. Despite a 2017 government pledge to phase out the plant, production has been increased, fueling public outrage. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination' and has blamed past administrations for the damage. Environmental activist Safouan Kbibieh claims the pollution has degraded the entire local ecosystem, even affecting food. Authorities have responded by bringing in Chinese companies to manage gas emissions and prevent further environmental dumping into the Mediterranean. The unrest represents a major test of governance and public trust in Tunisia since President Saied took extraordinary powers in 2021.",
