  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated a major structural change to the White House by demolishing the East Wing to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, estimated to cost $250 million and capable of seating up to 999 people. This marks the first such renovation since 1948 and the first under Trump, despite the absence of formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently shut down due to a government shutdown. The project, announced in July 2025 and confirmed via Truth Social, is funded entirely privately by Trump and private donors, with no cost to taxpayers. The East Wing, which has housed the First Lady’s offices since 1977 and includes a visitor’s entrance and underground bunker, is being reconstructed with design leadership from McCrery Architects and construction by Clark Construction, supported by engineering from AECOM. Critics have questioned the safety and feasibility, especially given the location directly over the president’s emergency bunker. The White House, built in 1792 and redesigned over centuries, remains a central symbol of U.S. governance, and this project reflects both a long-standing presidential aspiration and a moment of political and architectural controversy.",
