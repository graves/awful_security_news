  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after being extradited from France. The case highlights systemic failures in prosecuting campus sexual assaults, including lost evidence, long delays in investigation, and institutional reluctance to act. Shannon Keeler, the victim, pursued charges for over a decade, eventually gaining public attention through an Associated Press story in 2021, which led to renewed prosecution. Cleary pleaded guilty and admitted remorse, citing a 12-step program as part of his atonement. Despite this, the Facebook message he sent saying 'So I raped you' re-traumatized Keeler and exposed the lasting impact of sexual violence. The case underscores the urgent need for reform in how institutions respond to sexual assault, especially on college campuses.",
