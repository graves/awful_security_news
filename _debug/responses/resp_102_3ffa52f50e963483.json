  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission—the federal agency responsible for such projects. President Donald Trump announced the project as a private, taxpayer-funded initiative, claiming it would not interfere with the historic structure and would accommodate up to 999 people. The demolition, visible in photos, has drawn public and legal scrutiny, especially since the East Wing houses the first lady’s offices and has been renovated since 1902. The White House asserts that site preparation and demolition fall outside the NCPC’s jurisdiction, but the lack of formal review raises concerns about compliance with federal oversight. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an energy-efficient HVAC system, and the project is expected to be completed by January 2029. The White House has not disclosed donor information, contributing to transparency concerns.",
