The demolition of parts of the East Wing — traditionally used by the first lady — has sparked public and institutional concern, as the White House claims the project is necessary due to the East Room's limited capacity. While President Donald Trump asserts the work is privately funded and will not burden taxpayers, no donor list has been released. The construction, which began in September 2025, includes site preparation and the potential relocation of offices, with the ballroom projected for completion before the end of Trump’s term in January 2029. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an HVAC system for the new space, and the project has drawn scrutiny for bypassing federal oversight and altering a historic part of the White House.",
