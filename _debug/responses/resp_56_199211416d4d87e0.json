  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Electricity bills are rising across the U.S., with increases driven by a surge in demand from AI-powered data centers. A 13% rise in average electricity prices since 2022 reflects broader trends, but AI is now a major catalyst — with tech giants like Meta and Microsoft spending billions on data center construction. The Department of Energy projects data centers will consume 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Experts say this surge, fueled by the computational demands of advanced AI systems, is straining the power grid and pushing prices up, especially in regions near data centers. Some states, like Oregon, are addressing the issue by requiring data centers to pay for their grid strain, to protect residential consumers from cost increases.",
