  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police in southwest Dublin on 2025-10-21, throwing bottles and launching fireworks after allegations of a sexual assault on a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum applicants. The accused man, possibly an asylum seeker who requested a Romanian interpreter, was charged, though his ethnicity was not confirmed. The girl reportedly absconded while under state care, adding to public concern. The protests, marked by signs reading 'Irish lives matter' and chants of 'Get them out!', turned violent when a police van was set on fire. This follows a similar pattern of unrest in 2023 after a knife attack involving a man from Algeria, and echoes earlier riots in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, where two Romanian boys were arrested on suspicion of assault. Despite Ireland having no far-right members of Parliament, rising anti-immigration sentiment has led to repeated violent demonstrations, with officials like Minister Jim O’Callaghan and Prime Minister Michael Martin condemning the weaponization of crime and calling for strong government responses.",
