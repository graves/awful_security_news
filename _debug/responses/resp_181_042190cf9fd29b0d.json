  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO have discovered two new species in the deep sea off Western Australia during a 2022 expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park. These include a semi-transparent porcelain crab, about 1.5cm long, found at 122 meters depth, which feeds using long hairs to catch plankton, and a new lantern shark species, the West Australian Lantern Shark, found over 600 meters below sea level, growing up to 40cm with bioluminescent features. The discoveries highlight Australia’s status as a biodiversity hotspot and the vast amount of unexplored marine life, with around 600 more species estimated to remain to be described. Scientists emphasize that the deep-sea environment, particularly in protected areas like the Gascoyne Marine Park, remains a frontier for biological discovery.",
