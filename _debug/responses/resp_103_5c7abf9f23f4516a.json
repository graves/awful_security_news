  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study in Pediatrics, led by Dr. David Hill of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, shows that reversing long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infancy — based on the 2015 LEAP study — has significantly reduced food allergies in U.S. children. Since the 2015 shift in guidelines, including those from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, peanut allergy rates have dropped by 43%, with a 36% decrease in overall food allergies. The study analyzes data from over 120,000 children and estimates that at least 40,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies due to early exposure. While the findings are promising, experts like Dr. Corinne Keet note challenges in real-world implementation and limitations in data collection, such as reliance on diagnostic codes rather than actual eating habits. The reversal in guidance — from avoidance to early exposure — marks a pivotal shift in pediatric health, offering long-term benefits given that only about 10% of children who develop peanut allergies outgrow them.",
