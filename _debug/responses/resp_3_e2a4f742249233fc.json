  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On Sunday, October 20, 2025, a high-profile heist occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where armed thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery, stealing jewelry from the French crown jewels, including a diamond and sapphire tiara and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise. The theft, which took place in just seven minutes between 9:34 and 9:38 a.m., is estimated to be worth $102 million (88 million euros). The robbers used tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch to bypass security, and escaped on two scooters along the Seine. Eight of the nine stolen items remain unaccounted for. French prosecutors and officials, including prosecutor Laure Beccuau and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have highlighted serious security flaws, such as unsecured windows and public placement of a basket lift. Experts, including French senator Natalie Goulet and author Elaine Sciolino, believe the jewelry has likely been dismantled and sold abroad for money laundering, with no realistic chance of recovery. The incident has sparked national outrage, with critics calling it a 'dagger into the heart of France' and a stark reminder of the vulnerability of cultural heritage. The event is compared to historic heists like the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 Corot heist, underscoring a long-standing issue in museum security. The Apollo Gallery remains closed, and the Louvre is scheduled to reopen on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.",
