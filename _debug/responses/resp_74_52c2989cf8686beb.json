  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, is charged with 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing sensitive data with family members without proper clearances. Unlike the cases of James Comey and Letitia James, where Trump directly pressured prosecutors and used politically appointed officials, Bolton’s charges were brought by experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors, and the investigation began under the Biden administration. A key difference is that the indictment alleges a cyber breach by an actor linked to Iran, which exposed classified national defense data, suggesting a more serious threat than prior cases. While Trump has publicly accused Bolton of crimes and targeted him with administrative actions like stripping his security clearance, he did not directly orchestrate the charges. A 2020 federal judge had previously warned that Bolton likely jeopardized national security, which adds credibility to the current charges. The article suggests that Bolton’s case may be more substantial than prior political prosecutions due to its potential impact on national security and the depth of investigative detail.",
