  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Roman Surovtsev, a stateless immigrant from the former Soviet Union, was detained at a routine ICE check-in in August 2025, despite having no valid citizenship documents and no viable path to deportation. ICE attempted to deport him to Ukraine, a country that cannot provide travel documents and is currently in active war with Russia, making the move effectively a death sentence. Roman’s wife, Samantha, secured legal representation, successfully vacated his carjacking conviction, and reinstated his green card. Despite these legal victories, ICE continues to detain him, arguing that travel documents are still being requested. The case highlights systemic issues in U.S. immigration policy, including mass detention, lack of due process, and the disregard of human rights. Multiple similar habeas cases have been filed, signaling broader legal resistance to re-detention practices under the Trump administration’s one-million-deportation goal. The story underscores the human cost of immigration enforcement and the urgent need for legal protections for stateless and vulnerable individuals.",
