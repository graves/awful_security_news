  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America have led to significant political changes, with Madagascar in 2025 seeing the removal of President Andry Rajoelina through a convergence of youth activism and military intervention. This follows similar events in Bangladesh (2024), Sri Lanka (2022), and Nepal (2025), where Gen Z movements driven by grievances over corruption, economic hardship, and poor governance have successfully ousted leaders. The role of social media and technology in organizing these protests is pivotal. While Madagascar’s youth achieved a partial victory, power now rests with military commander Michael Randrianirina, suggesting that youth movements alone may not fully achieve democratic transitions. Experts warn that such movements are likely to grow in influence across Africa, where youth form over half the population and face high unemployment and systemic governance failures. African leaders, including those in Kenya, Uganda, and Morocco, are responding with resistance, including threats, arrests, and prolonged rule, indicating a growing political contest between youth demands and state power. The article raises urgent concerns about the future of governance in Africa, suggesting that if current conditions persist, youth-led uprisings may become a regular feature of political life on the continent.",
