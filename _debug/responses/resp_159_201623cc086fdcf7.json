  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The University of Arizona has become the seventh elite university to reject the Trump administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education, citing commitments to academic freedom, merit-based funding, and institutional independence. The compact proposes politically driven policies such as eliminating race and sex in admissions and hiring, limiting international student enrollment to 15%, and abolishing departments that suppress conservative viewpoints. The initiative has drawn widespread criticism from academic unions like the AAUP and AFT, who accuse the administration of favoritism and ideological bias. Other institutions such as Brown, MIT, USC, Penn, Virginia, and Dartmouth have similarly rejected the compact, while Vanderbilt and Texas at Austin remain undecided. Legal challenges have emerged, including a September 2025 federal ruling that found the administration violated the law by canceling over $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard, calling the cuts ideologically motivated. The broader context includes the Trump administration’s targeting of universities involved in antiwar protests following the 2023 Gaza war, which the administration falsely linked to anti-Semitism, a claim rejected by student activists.",
