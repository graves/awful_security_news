  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 have severely damaged the country’s middle class, which historically supported political reform, stability, and entrepreneurship. A study in the European Journal of Political Economy uses a synthetic control method to show that without sanctions, the middle class would have grown by 17%, but instead it shrank by 28% by 2019, with an estimated 9 million people losing middle-class status. Rising inflation, unemployment, and fuel shortages have deepened the wealth gap, leading to increased social resentment. The political landscape has shifted from middle-class demands for reform to working-class struggles for survival, weakening long-term democratic engagement. Sanctions have also strengthened hardline institutions like the IRGC and bonyads, entrenching authoritarian power. This trend threatens long-term social stability and reform, making the recovery of the middle class a generational challenge.",
