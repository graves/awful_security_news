  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 21, 2025, CVS reported a network outage that prevented some of its pharmacies from fulfilling prescriptions and providing flu shots, prompting customer frustration and social media complaints. The company confirmed the issue was due to a known system connection failure, which has since been resolved, with some minor delays reported. This event occurred just one day after Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major cloud outage, highlighting how society’s dependence on digital infrastructure—especially in healthcare and daily services—makes it vulnerable when these systems fail. While CVS recently expanded by acquiring 60 Rite Aid locations, the outage appears unrelated to this business move.",
