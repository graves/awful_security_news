    "Historically, the party making extraneous policy demands (like GOP's border wall demand in 2018-19) has lost politically during shutdowns; however, this dynamic is reversed in 2025 due to the popularity of the Democrats’ policy demand.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The federal government shutdown has now reached 21 days, the second-longest in history, with potential for it to exceed 35 days if unresolved by early November. Despite Democrats making a popular policy demand—extending Obamacare subsidies, supported by 72% of Americans—public opinion polls show they are winning the blame game, with Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats. Historically, the party making policy demands (like GOP in 1995 and 2018–19) has lost politically, but this dynamic is flipped due to the popularity of the Democrats’ demand. Key consequences of the shutdown—such as delayed paychecks, small business loans, and food stamp aid—add pressure, especially as open enrollment for Obamacare begins on November 1, when premiums could double. Democrats may consider backing down at that point to shift political blame to Republicans, but if Republicans fear the political fallout from premium hikes, they may be compelled to negotiate. This situation presents a unique and complex political dynamic, with Democrats potentially gaining political leverage by holding out.",
