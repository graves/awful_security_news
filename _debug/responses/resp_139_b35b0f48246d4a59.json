  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a college football game on October 18, 2025, the Michigan Wolverines defeated the Washington Huskies 24-7. Jordan Marshall, playing in place of injured Justice Haynes, had a career-high 133 yards on the ground and scored a crucial 14-yard touchdown after Washington quarterback Demond Williams Jr. was intercepted. Bryce Underwood threw two touchdown passes, including a 22-yard and a 10-yard pass, to help Michigan's offense. Michigan's defense, which had struggled in the previous week's loss to USC, excelled by intercepting Williams twice in a key stretch and recovering from turnovers. Washington, led by Williams, faced offensive difficulties, with Williams being picked off three times in five attempts, and tight end Quentin Moore was injured during the game. Michigan, now 5-2 and 3-1 in the Big Ten, continued a rebuilding phase after falling out of the AP Top 25, while Washington fell to 5-2 and 2-2. The game highlighted the importance of defensive discipline, offensive consistency, and team resilience in college football.",
