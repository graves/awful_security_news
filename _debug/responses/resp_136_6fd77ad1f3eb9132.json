  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial showed that early introduction of peanut products to infants significantly reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms a measurable public health impact. Since 2015, when medical guidelines recommended introducing peanuts as early as 4 months, the rate of peanut allergies in young children has declined by more than 27%, and by over 40% after 2017 guidelines expanded. The study, led by Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records from pediatric practices and found that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since the recommendations took hold. The 2015 LEAP trial by Gideon Lack at King’s College London demonstrated that early exposure reduced allergy risk by over 80%. Despite initial slow adoption—only 29% of pediatricians followed the guidance—real-world data now show that early allergen introduction is being adopted and is having a tangible effect. Experts and advocacy groups like FARE now endorse the practice, recommending small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and other allergens between 4 and 6 months of age as safe and effective for immune system development.",
