  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions, leading the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to postpone the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months. The NZF, which would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon pricing system for ships, was previously approved in April but delayed due to political pressure from the United States. Despite support from major economies like China, the EU, and Britain, opposition from Russia and Saudi Arabia, along with shifts from Argentina and Singapore, contributed to the vote. The decision was condemned by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping as a missed opportunity to advance climate action in shipping, which is already being impacted by extreme weather and changing ocean conditions. The delay undermines progress toward the IMO’s goal of reducing shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050.",
