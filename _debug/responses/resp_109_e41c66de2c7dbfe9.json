  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef initiative that combines marine art, coral restoration, and ecotourism. Led by artist and cultural placemaker Ximena Caminos and marine biologist Colin Foord, the project features underwater sculptures—including 22 concrete cars designed as coral habitats—crafted from marine-grade concrete. The corals, including resilient gorgonians, are grown in nurseries and transplanted to the reef, which will be located about 700 feet offshore in 15 to 20 feet of water, accessible to divers and snorkelers. The project aims to restore a historic coral reef that was buried in the 1970s and is funded in part by a $5 million city bond with additional funding goals. It also includes an onshore marine learning center and may eventually feature 57 giant starfish sculptures as a symbolic urban landmark. The initiative blends science, art, and community engagement to create a sustainable, publicly accessible underwater ecosystem.",
