  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A government shutdown has led to widespread furloughs of National Park Service employees, resulting in limited staffing, no entrance fees, and reduced law enforcement at key national parks. While tourists like Nudrat Mahajabin continue visiting, advocates warn of serious safety risks such as unauthorized drone flights, base jumping, and trash accumulation, which could compromise park safety and ecosystems. In West Virginia, state funds have kept New River Gorge and Harpers Ferry National Parks open to protect tourism revenue, especially for Bridge Day. In Washington, DC, closures of federal museums have led to a surge in visitors to private attractions like Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum. However, local businesses—such as Mountain Mama cabins and DC Trails—report mixed outcomes, with some experiencing declines and others remaining stable. Advocacy groups are urging park closures due to risks to visitor safety and operational integrity, while the Department of Interior maintains that critical safety functions remain active. The article underscores the tension between public access and long-term park sustainability during political gridlock.",
