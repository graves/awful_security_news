  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, President Donald Trump faces minimal public support in the United States, with his approval ratings on both the deal and domestic issues remaining low. While one poll shows a slight improvement in approval on Gaza, disapproval remains high, and overall approval is at a second-term low. Economic concerns — including inflation, rising costs of living, and job insecurity — are now the dominant public issues, with a majority of Americans disapproving of Trump’s economic leadership and expressing pessimism about the future of the economy. Public skepticism about foreign policy successes is amplified by the short-lived nature of previous peace efforts, such as the Biden administration’s ceasefire. Americans prioritize domestic economic well-being over international diplomacy, suggesting that Trump’s global achievements are not translating into political capital at home.",
