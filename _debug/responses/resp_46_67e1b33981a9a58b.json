  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a government shutdown in October 2025, many national parks including Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite remained open despite staff furloughs and lack of ranger presence. While some local businesses report no immediate losses, others—such as Mountain Mama in Harpers Ferry—see a 30% drop in bookings, signaling economic vulnerability. Increased tourism to private museums like Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC, reflects a shift in visitor behavior. Advocacy groups warn that limited staffing increases risks of illegal activities, vandalism, and trash buildup, undermining park safety and visitor experience. The Department of the Interior maintains critical services, but long-term impacts on local economies and park operations remain a growing concern.",
