The incident follows a sustained pattern of detentions since August 2025, with over 50 UN staff now reportedly imprisoned. Houthi forces confiscated all communication devices, and the UN has denied allegations of espionage, calling the accusations 'dangerous and unacceptable'. The UN has suspended operations in Saada and relocated key personnel, while calling for immediate release of detained staff. This escalation reflects broader hostility toward humanitarian actors in Yemen, where a prolonged civil war has led to one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.",
