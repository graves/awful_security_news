  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, tourists continue to visit national parks despite closures and staffing shortages. While some businesses report no immediate decline, others face reduced bookings and economic strain. Key parks like Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and New River Gorge remain open through state and federal agreements, but with no rangers present, safety risks such as illegal base jumping, drone use, and vandalism have increased. Advocacy groups warn that limited staffing compromises emergency response, environmental safety, and visitor education. Simultaneously, tourism in Washington, D.C., shifts to private museums due to closures of the Smithsonian and National Zoo, with Mount Vernon and other sites seeing significant visitor increases. However, local economies face long-term financial losses, especially during peak seasons. The article raises urgent concerns about the sustainability of park operations and the broader economic and safety implications of prolonged federal shutdowns.",
