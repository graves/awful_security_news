  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, including the termination of President Biden’s humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans, has led to widespread job losses and economic disruption. Immigrant workers, such as Maria, a school cleaner in Florida, are being displaced, while skilled foreign workers are being deterred by a massive increase in H-1B visa fees. The loss of foreign labor is harming essential sectors like farming and construction, with hiring slowing to just 29,000 jobs per month from June to August. Experts from the Brookings Institution, CBO, and other think tanks warn that without immigrant labor, the U.S. could face near-zero or negative job growth and reduced innovation. Organizations like Goodwin Living and farmers like John Boyd Jr. are struggling to replace workers, and foreign governments, including South Korea, are reconsidering U.S. investment due to immigration instability.",
