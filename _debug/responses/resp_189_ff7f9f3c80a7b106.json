  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new species during a deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park in late 2022: a tiny porcelain crab about 1.5cm long using hairs to filter food and a bioluminescent lantern shark with large eyes found over 600 meters below sea level. These discoveries underscore Australia’s rich but largely unexplored marine biodiversity, with over 20 new species identified and an estimated 600 more awaiting formal description due to the time required for scientific validation.",
