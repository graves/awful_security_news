Zelenskyy criticized Trump’s failure to provide the missiles and expressed skepticism about Hungary hosting future Trump-Putin meetings, citing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s obstruction of Ukrainian interests.

Zelenskyy noted that although Putin’s demand for full control over eastern Donetsk and Luhansk remains unchanged, all parties appear to have moved closer to a possible war end, with Trump aiming to leverage his Middle East successes to push for a peaceful resolution.",
