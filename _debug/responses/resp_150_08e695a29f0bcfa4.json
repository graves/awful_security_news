  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bolivia is holding a presidential run-off election on October 19, 2025, marking the end of nearly two decades of socialist rule under the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party. The vote pits conservative former interim President Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga against centrist economist Rodrigo Paz, both of whom promise to reform the country’s crisis-hit economy, reduce inflation, and restore relations with the United States. The nation, facing a severe economic downturn with inflation above 20%, fuel shortages, and long queues, sees this election as a turning point toward market-oriented policies. While both candidates propose cutting the universal fuel subsidy and opening the economy to foreign investment, the MAS party's failure to field a candidate in the first round signals a decisive political shift. Public sentiment reflects deep economic hardship, with citizens expressing low hope for improvement. Analysts warn that without meaningful reforms, especially for vulnerable populations, social unrest could follow. Despite the political change, challenges remain, including the continued influence of former President Evo Morales and the lack of congressional support for either candidate. The election is seen as a transformative moment in Bolivia’s political and economic trajectory, with potential long-term implications for U.S.-Bolivia relations.",
