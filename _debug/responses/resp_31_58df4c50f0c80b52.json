  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels during daylight hours, marks a significant shift in museum crime. Unlike traditional heists focused on high-profile paintings, this robbery targets raw materials for resale or melting, reflecting a new trend in art theft. The operation, which included the use of an angle grinder, gasoline, and a walkie-talkie, echoes similar incidents like the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden. Experts, including Remigiusz Plath and Laura Evans, argue that museums are now vulnerable due to open access and low physical barriers, making them 'soft targets.' The theft has prompted national outrage in France, with Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticizing security failures. French authorities and Interpol are investigating, and the stolen items — including the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie — are now listed in Interpol’s stolen cultural heritage database. This incident signals a troubling escalation in museum crime, moving from cultural exploitation to industrial theft with long-term consequences for national heritage.",
