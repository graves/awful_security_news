  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic late-game comebacks, historic performances, and significant coaching decisions. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit to defeat the New York Giants, becoming the first team to reverse a 161-0 lead record since 2007, with second-year QB Bo Nix delivering a breakout performance. Meanwhile, New England Patriots’ Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, marking a turning point in the franchise’s quarterback development. On the flip side, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets suffered devastating losses, leading to high-profile quarterback benchings: Tua Tagovailoa was replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers, and Justin Fields was benched at halftime, replaced by Tyrod Taylor. The Green Bay Packers also secured a late win against the Arizona Cardinals, fueled by Micah Parsons’ defensive dominance. The season has now seen 26 lead changes in the final two minutes of regulation, the most in NFL history, reflecting a growing trend of unpredictability and intensity in the league.",
