  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A significant increase in car loan delinquency among Americans with credit scores below 670—up to 6.43% since 2021—has raised alarms among economists, marking the second-highest level since the early 1990s. This trend, which surpasses delinquency rates during past recessions, reflects deepening financial stress caused by record auto payments, soaring repair and insurance costs, and the resumption of student loan payments. Despite a slight stabilization in 2025, economists warn that a weakening labor market and increasing layoffs could worsen the crisis. Unlike prime borrowers, who show minimal delinquency, subprime borrowers face overwhelming financial pressure, often unable to sell their vehicles due to negative equity. The situation exemplifies a 'K-shaped economy' where wealthier consumers thrive while lower-income Americans struggle. Lenders are actively using GPS tracking and ignition disabling to recover vehicles, signaling that current delinquency and repossession levels are nearing or matching those seen during the Great Recession.",
