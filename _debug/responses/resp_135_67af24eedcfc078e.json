  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using royal titles such as Duke of York following renewed public and political pressure tied to allegations of inappropriate behavior and prolonged contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While he has formally relinquished the use of titles, he still holds the title by inheritance. These actions come amid revelations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a survivor who claims she had sex with Andrew when she was 17 and that he treated the relationship as a 'birthright.' The controversy intensified after a 2019 BBC interview, a 2022 civil settlement, and new disclosures about Andrew’s 2011 attempt to have Giuffre’s criminal record investigated. Public outrage, amplified by political figures like SNP lawmaker Stephen Flynn, has led calls for formal removal of titles through legislation. The British government and monarchy have emphasized constitutional boundaries, stating that such decisions should not be made unilaterally. As Giuffre’s memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' is set for publication, further revelations may emerge, potentially deepening the scrutiny on the royal family and its members.",
