  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after more than a week of deadly cross-border fighting, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The conflict, rooted in accusations of cross-border terrorism and violations of sovereignty, escalated when Pakistan conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan’s Paktika province targeting militant groups like Hafiz Gul Bahadur. The strikes killed at least 10 civilians, including three local cricketers, prompting widespread condemnation, a cricket boycott by Afghanistan’s national board, and international outcry from the ICC. The Taliban accused Pakistan of violating Afghan sovereignty, while Pakistan’s army chief urged mutual security. Despite the ceasefire, experts warn that the core issue—Taliban denial of responsibility for militant activity and the disputed Durand Line—remains unresolved, threatening long-term regional instability.",
