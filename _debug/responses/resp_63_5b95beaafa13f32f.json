  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal agencies, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for allegedly violating her order to restrict the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests against immigration enforcement in Chicago. The controversy stems from Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led crackdown that resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, 2025. Despite promises of compliance, Judge Ellis expressed serious concerns that her directives—such as requiring body-worn cameras and banning unannounced deployment of tear gas—are not being followed. Officials including Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified, denying reports of tear gas use without warning, though they acknowledged not having personally witnessed such incidents. The judge has mandated that key officials, such as former ICE Chicago head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino, be deposed to provide full context. Protests at the Broadview ICE facility have continued, with over 100 demonstrators and 30 arrests reported, highlighting public resistance to immigration enforcement. The case underscores the tension between federal executive power and judicial oversight in policing civil dissent.",
