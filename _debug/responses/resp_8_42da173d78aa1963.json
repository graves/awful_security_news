  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay, leading to widespread financial distress. Federal employees like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams are struggling to cover rent and basic needs, prompting large-scale food bank events such as one in Landover, Maryland, where more than 370 households received food — far exceeding expectations. Organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries, the event required federal IDs to verify eligibility, underscoring the direct link between employment status and access to aid. The situation reflects deep legislative division: Senator Ron Johnson proposes paying only those working during the shutdown, while Democrats demand full pay for all federal workers. Personal testimonies reveal a shift in perception among federal employees, from viewing government jobs as secure to now facing real hardship, highlighting the human cost of political gridlock.",
