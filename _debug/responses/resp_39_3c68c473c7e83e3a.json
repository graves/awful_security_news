  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million federal workers—many of whom have been furloughed or are working without pay—face severe financial strain. A food bank event in Landover, Maryland, organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries, served more than 370 households, significantly exceeding expectations. Workers like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams express shock at the loss of job security, with some having to rely on food pantries despite having previously considered themselves financially stable. The crisis has prompted legislative debate, with Republican Senator Ron Johnson proposing to pay only those working during the shutdown, while Democrats push for universal payment. The event underscores how federal employment, once seen as secure, is now exposed as vulnerable during prolonged shutdowns, highlighting both the human and systemic impacts of government gridlock.",
