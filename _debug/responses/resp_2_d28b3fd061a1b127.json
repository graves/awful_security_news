  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the implications of Amazon Web Services' Monday, October 20, 2025, outage, which exposed the internet’s deep dependency on a small number of cloud providers. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly central to daily operations — from healthcare to finance — businesses face heightened risks if AI tools or cloud infrastructure fail. The article highlights that AWS, Microsoft, and Google dominate cloud computing and AI services, creating a single point of failure. It notes that AI's high computational demands and the trend toward automation are pushing greater reliance on cloud computing, raising concerns about resilience. However, solutions are emerging through diversification of cloud providers, investment in AI-specific data centers, and development of more efficient, locally run AI models. Experts warn that while AI promises efficiency, its widespread adoption also increases systemic vulnerability, suggesting a need for more robust, distributed infrastructure.",
