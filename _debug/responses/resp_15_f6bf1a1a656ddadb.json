In response, Ukraine is expanding its air defenses and launching retaliatory long-range missile attacks on Russian facilities like the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Ukraine is also urgently seeking European support, including air defense systems and financial aid, with the European Union exploring the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—as funding. The Kremlin denies legitimacy to such asset use.
