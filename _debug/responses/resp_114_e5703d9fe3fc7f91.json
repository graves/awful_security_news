  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million, 999-person-capacity ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal body that regulates major renovations to government buildings. President Donald Trump, who announced the project in July, claims the new space is long overdue due to the limitations of the existing East Room and his preference for hosting dignitaries indoors. The demolition has sparked controversy, as the East Wing, built in 1902 and housing key offices including those of the First Lady, will be permanently altered. The White House asserts that site preparation and demolition fall outside the jurisdiction of the NCPC, but the project has proceeded without formal review. Private contributions, including a donation of HVAC systems from Carrier Global Corp., are funding the construction, with no cost to taxpayers. The ballroom, set for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, represents the largest structural change to the White House since the 1948 Truman Balcony addition.",
