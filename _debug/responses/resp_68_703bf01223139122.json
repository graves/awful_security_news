  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has issued a public call for widespread vaccination, criticizing federal officials—including President Donald Trump—for spreading false claims about vaccines and altering immunization schedules. The coalition highlights rising measles outbreaks in areas like South Carolina, where over 100 unvaccinated students are in quarantine, as evidence of the dangers of declining vaccination rates. They argue that public health decisions must be grounded in science, not political ideology, and express concern over declining trust in the CDC, which has seen public confidence drop to just 50% according to a KFF poll. The CDC and HHS are responding by asserting a return to science-based, non-political vaccine guidance, yet the growing divergence among major medical organizations such as the AAP and ACOG signals a deepening crisis in public health coordination and trust. As local jurisdictions like Mecklenburg County face cross-boundary health threats, the coalition emphasizes that local collaboration is essential to protect public safety in an era of fragmented federal leadership.",
