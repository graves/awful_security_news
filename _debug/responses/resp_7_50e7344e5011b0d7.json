A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, Puerto Rico, Florida, and the Bahamas could face rain and wind impacts. The storm’s development is fueled by extremely warm Caribbean waters, a phenomenon linked to global warming and climate change, and reflects a broader trend of rapid intensification observed in recent hurricanes such as Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Forecasters are monitoring two potential tracks: one turning north toward Hispaniola and another moving west toward Central America. The article underscores the growing danger of late-season storms and the need for vigilance as hurricane season continues beyond its official end date.",
