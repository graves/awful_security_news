  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is pressing federal officials, particularly ICE and CBP agents in Chicago, over their response to protests during Operation Midway Blitz, a major ICE enforcement effort that led to over 1,000 arrests. The judge expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for federal agents during protests, noting that some agents, especially those in ICE’s Special Response Teams, are not equipped with them. She questioned the training, transparency, and use of force—particularly in incidents involving Reverend David Black, who claimed he was struck with pepper balls without warning while praying outside the Broadview detention facility. Despite ICE asserting internal training and review processes, the judge continues to pursue accountability by deposing high-ranking officials including Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino. The White House has denied media reports of tear gas use without warning, adding tension over transparency and federal authority in protest enforcement.",
