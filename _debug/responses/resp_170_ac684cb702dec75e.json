  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge is proving essential in responding to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) as technological early warning systems fail. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on traditional signs—such as sudden rainfall, animal behavior, and sound patterns—to detect disasters and activate community evacuations. Despite government investments, such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, there is widespread distrust in the systems due to malfunctioning equipment, lack of follow-up, and poor community engagement. These failures have led to a reliance on human-based warnings, where timely action by local residents has saved lives. The article highlights Pakistan’s status as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, with rising temperatures accelerating glacier melt and flood risks. It underscores the urgent need to integrate traditional Indigenous knowledge into official disaster response frameworks, as a more culturally grounded, effective, and trusted system for climate resilience.",
