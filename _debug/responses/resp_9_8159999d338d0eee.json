  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been scrapped, with the White House stating there are no plans for such a meeting in the immediate future. This reversal follows a previous statement by Trump that a summit would occur within two weeks after a phone call. The administration now believes that high-level meetings between US Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, intended to lay groundwork, are unnecessary due to divergent positions—especially on Ukraine’s need for long-range missiles—and Lavrov’s limited influence in real decision-making. The Kremlin rejected the idea of freezing the war, which Trump had proposed after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky argues that Russia has become less interested in diplomacy due to the US withholding key weapons, suggesting that long-range capabilities are essential for peace. Despite these challenges, the Trump administration remains committed to brokering peace in Ukraine, and future diplomatic talks may occur at an ASEAN-led meeting in Malaysia, though no immediate summit with Putin is on the horizon.",
