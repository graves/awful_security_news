  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, the two sides have exchanged the remains of captives, with Hamas returning 15 Israeli captives' bodies—among them soldier Tamir Adar and civilian Aryeh Zalmanovich—and Israel returning 15 Palestinian dead. The article highlights Israel’s failure to open the Rafah border crossing with Egypt since May 2024, despite an ICJ order, which severely limits humanitarian access and has been cited by Hamas as a violation of the ceasefire. Palestinian officials, including Ubai Al-Aboudi, argue that detained Palestinians are dehumanized 'hostages' due to lack of due process and abuse. A forensic team reported signs of abuse on some returned bodies, and both parties remain committed to the ceasefire despite ongoing tensions and violations. The situation underscores deep humanitarian and political challenges in Gaza, including the dehumanization of detainees and the critical importance of humanitarian corridors.",
