  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked antidepressants based on their physical side effects, revealing significant differences in impacts such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations. The research, involving over 58,500 patients across 151 studies, shows that even patients with the same diagnosis may benefit from different drugs depending on individual health conditions. While SSRIs like sertraline and citalopram generally have fewer side effects, other drugs such as venlafaxine or paroxetine carry risks for cardiovascular or metabolic issues. The findings challenge the current UK prescribing pattern, where 85% of prescriptions go to just three generic SSRIs, and suggest a shift toward personalized treatment. Researchers emphasize that patients should not discontinue treatment but should engage in shared decision-making with clinicians. A free online tool is being developed to support such personalized choices, though cultural changes in the NHS are needed to implement these recommendations. The study analyzed side effects within the first eight weeks of treatment, with researchers noting potential long-term cumulative risks, especially in chronic depression.",
