  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man from Rhode Island, to a prison term ranging from five years to life for two rape convictions from 2008, after authorities identified him through a decade-old DNA rape kit. Rossi had falsely claimed to have died in 2020, using a fake obituary, and had previously fled the U.S. by using false identities, including claiming to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. He was arrested in Scotland in 2023 due to recognition of his tattoos from an Interpol notice, extradited to Utah in January 2024, and convicted in both cases. The victims described being manipulated financially and subjected to abuse, with one stating the case was about safety and accountability. Rossi, who had a history of evading justice and failing to register as a sex offender, is now facing multiple legal consequences, including fraud charges in Ohio. The case underscores the dangers of serial abusers and the importance of clearing rape kit backlogs and using international cooperation to bring fugitives to justice.",
