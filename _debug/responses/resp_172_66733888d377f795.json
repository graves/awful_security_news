  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that, despite current efforts under the Paris Climate Agreement, the planet will still face an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100 — a significant climate risk for vulnerable nations. The study reveals that small, ocean-dependent countries like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face dramatically higher increases in dangerous heat, with up to 149 extra days per year, despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions. In contrast, top emitters such as the United States, China, and India — responsible for 42% of global CO₂ — will face only 23–30 extra days, exposing a profound global injustice in climate impacts. Experts warn this disparity could deepen global inequities and threaten geopolitical stability, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by rising extreme heat, even if the warming is not as severe as in worst-case scenarios.",
