  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual sounds, animal behavior, or lightning—plays a vital role in predicting and responding to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially as government early warning systems fail due to technical flaws, lack of maintenance, and community distrust. Despite significant investments like the $37 million GLOF-II project, residents have reported that warnings have come from local shepherds such as Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, who use traditional signals like gunfire or fire to alert villages. This reliance on human-based systems, passed down through generations, highlights a critical gap in policy: the failure of top-down technological solutions to integrate with local, lived experience. As climate change accelerates, with Pakistan's temperatures rising 1.3°C since the 1950s and nearly 90 GLOFs occurring between 2019 and 2022, Indigenous knowledge emerges not just as a survival tool, but as a proven, culturally rooted mechanism of climate resilience. The article calls for a reevaluation of disaster response strategies that prioritize community trust, local knowledge, and participatory implementation over isolated technological deployment.",
