  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 government shutdown, the White House announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue—typically dedicated to child nutrition—to keep the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) operational. WIC, which supports nearly 7 million vulnerable families, faced a funding lapse due to Congress’s failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the White House claims the plan is a ‘creative solution,’ experts and advocacy groups question its legality and long-term stability, noting that Congress has not formally appropriated funds. The decision has drawn bipartisan political attention, with House Speaker Mike Johnson criticizing Democrats for shutting down essential programs. Despite the temporary fix, advocates stress that long-term, sustainable funding is needed to ensure continued access to nutrition support amid rising food costs and increased enrollment.",
