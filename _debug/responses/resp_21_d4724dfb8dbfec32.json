The protest follows a prior incident in 2023 after a stabbing of three children and reflects a growing trend of far-right activism in Ireland, despite the country lacking far-right parliamentary representation. A 20-something man was charged with assaulting a young girl, and Sinn Fein noted he had a deportation order from March 2025. Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan condemned the actions as unacceptable, vowing a strong response and demanding a detailed review of the asylum case. The incident underscores rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Ireland, fueled by public anxiety over immigration and housing policies.",
