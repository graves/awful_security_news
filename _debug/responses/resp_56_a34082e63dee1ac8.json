  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Louvre Museum heist, where thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels during museum hours, marks a worrying shift in museum crime—from stealing culturally significant art to targeting raw materials for resale. The heist, described as a case of 'cultural terrorism,' shows increasing sophistication and coordination, with parallels to the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden. Experts like Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath argue that the rise of material-focused theft—due to high liquidity and ease of resale—is a major threat to cultural heritage. Evidence, including discarded tools and the damaged Empress Eugénie’s crown, indicates a well-planned, organized operation. The thefts in Paris, including earlier incidents at the Natural History Museum, suggest possible connections to organized crime, such as the Remmo clan. French authorities have acknowledged security failures, and Interpol has added the stolen items to its database, signaling international concern over the escalating threat to cultural institutions.",
