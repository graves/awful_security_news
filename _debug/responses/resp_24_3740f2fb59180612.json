  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A CNN investigation reveals that Guatemalan garment factories—known as maquilas—serve as a key production hub for US fashion brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, despite severe labor violations. Workers, mostly women, face exploitative conditions including long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Korean companies dominate the sector, controlling nearly two-thirds of textile investments, and US brands often have no direct responsibility for labor conditions. Union activity is met with resistance, and labor inspectors are blocked from factory access. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra suffer financial devastation upon layoff, with little to no severance or legal protection. While Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms, enforcement remains weak. The article exposes a global supply chain where consumer demand enables systemic exploitation, particularly of women, and calls for greater accountability and reform.",
