Since 1990, there have been six shutdowns, with increasing political polarization and procedural obstacles like the Senate filibuster making resolution difficult. The current situation is further complicated by a narrow House majority and lack of bipartisan consensus, highlighting ongoing challenges in U.S. legislative funding processes.",
