  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, through its national space agency SUPARCO. The H1 satellite, equipped with hyperspectral imaging technology, is expected to revolutionize precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management by detecting subtle chemical and material changes on Earth’s surface. This milestone reflects Pakistan’s strategic partnership with China and supports national development goals, including those of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While H1 will require about two months of calibration before full operational status, it marks a pivotal advancement in Pakistan’s space programme, which has expanded with three satellite launches in 2025, including already-operational EO-1 and KS-1.",
