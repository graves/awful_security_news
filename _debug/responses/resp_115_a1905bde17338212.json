    "Ants, specifically black garden ants (Lasius niger), modify their nest structures in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum.",
    "Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants, especially nurses, increase their distance from foragers, showing proactive social distancing.",
    "Nests exposed to the fungus become more compartmentalized, less interconnected, with longer travel routes and spaced-out entrances, reducing disease spread.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to the lethal fungus Metarhizium brunneum by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants, especially nurses, increase their distance from foragers, demonstrating a form of proactive social distancing. When threatened, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with longer travel routes, spaced entrances, and reduced interconnectivity, which slows the spread of infection. These changes, observed in a 2025 study led by Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, represent a first demonstration of non-human social species modifying their spatial environment to combat disease. The research suggests that principles of 'architectural immunity' — where space design limits disease transmission — could be applied to human public health and urban planning to protect vulnerable populations.",
