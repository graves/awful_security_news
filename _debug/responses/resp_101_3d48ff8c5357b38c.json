  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has commenced demolition of part of the East Wing, built in 1902 and housing key offices including the first lady's, to construct a $250 million ballroom that will accommodate up to 999 people. This project, announced by President Trump in July 2025, is being described as privately funded by donors and 'Patriots' and is set to be completed by January 2029. Despite claims that the ballroom will not interfere with the main structure and that it respects the existing White House, the White House has not secured approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees major federal construction. The demolition and site prep began in September 2025, with Carrier Global Corp. donating HVAC systems and Trump emphasizing the project's non-taxpayer cost. The East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated, and the project marks the largest structural change to the White House since 1948.",
