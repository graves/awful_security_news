Petro has repeatedly criticized US actions, including military strikes on drug-smuggling vessels, and faced visa revocation after a pro-Palestinian speech. The conflict reflects deeper tensions around drug trafficking, respect between nations, and the failure to resolve long-standing issues affecting both countries’ citizens.",
