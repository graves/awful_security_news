  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2025 reveals that reversing decades-old advice against early peanut exposure has significantly reduced food allergies in U.S. children. The shift, rooted in a 2015 landmark study called LEAP, led to new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, recommending that high-risk infants be introduced to peanuts between 4 and 6 months of age. By analyzing health data from over 120,000 children, researchers found a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergies, preventing at least 40,000 peanut allergy cases and 60,000 food allergy cases. Dr. David Hill, the lead researcher, attributes the success to early allergen introduction, while Dr. Corinne Keet, an independent expert, cautions about implementation challenges and data limitations. Despite these concerns, the study marks a major public health victory, demonstrating how evidence-based policy can reverse a growing epidemic.",
