  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef extending from the shoreline, combining art and science to restore a lost coral habitat. Led by artist and cultural placemaker Ximena Caminos and coral scientist Colin Foord, the project involves casting underwater sculptures — including cars and starfish — from marine-grade concrete. These sculptures serve as substrates for resilient soft corals like gorgonians, which are cultivated in nurseries and transplanted onto the reef. The reef, planned to take at least a decade to complete, will be accessible to the public at only 15 to 20 feet deep, 700 feet off the beach. Funded by a $5 million city bond and aiming to raise an additional $6 million, the project seeks to revive Miami Beach’s historical coral reef, promote ecotourism, and educate the public on coral reef conservation through an onshore learning center. Ultimately, Reefline blends environmental restoration with artistic innovation, aiming to become a symbol of sustainable urban coastal development and marine life recovery.",
