  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration proposed a funding compact for nine major U.S. universities, offering expanded federal research funding in exchange for significant ideological policy changes, including removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes. Seven universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and the University of Arizona — have formally rejected the offer, citing threats to academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House claims the compact would strengthen higher education through improved governance and federal partnerships, while universities argue that linking funding to ideological compliance undermines free inquiry and innovation. The situation highlights a growing conflict between federal political influence and institutional independence in American higher education, with state leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom adding further resistance through legislative threats.",
