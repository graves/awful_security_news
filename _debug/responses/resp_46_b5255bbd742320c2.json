  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing backlash against the Trump administration’s proposal for a federal funding compact with universities has emerged, with seven institutions—including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown—formally rejecting the offer. The compact, sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, requires changes to admissions, tuition, international enrollment, and gender definitions, and includes annual compliance polls. Critics argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding, warning that it could undermine innovation and create unfair competition. The White House claims the agreement promotes a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas,' but universities maintain that governance should remain independent. The deadline for initial sign-ons is November 21, 2025, and while some schools like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, others have reaffirmed their commitment to academic independence and free inquiry.",
