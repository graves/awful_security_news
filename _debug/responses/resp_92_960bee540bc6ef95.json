Over 2,500 demonstrations are planned across all 50 states, organized primarily by the Indivisible Project, which emphasizes peaceful, constitutional protest and broad political inclusivity. While Republican leaders have labeled the protests as anti-American or 'antifa-linked,' organizers argue they are a legitimate defense of democratic values and constitutional rights. The article highlights tensions over federal overreach, particularly in California and Texas, with state leaders resisting military deployment. The Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about potential violence, and experts warn that the administration may use the protests as a pretext to deploy troops under emergency powers. Despite political attacks and accusations, the movement claims to be rooted in American values and growing public support, with key figures like Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Indivisible leaders asserting the protests are a peaceful, necessary response to authoritarianism.",
