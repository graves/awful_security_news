  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, making the civics oral exam more difficult and longer. Starting October 20, 2025, applicants will need to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly—doubling the previous requirement of 6 out of 10. The list of potential questions will grow from 100 to 128, with more complex and value-based questions replacing simple ones like geography or holiday identification. The administration claims these changes ensure applicants are 'fully assimilated' and align with American values, citing that the current test is 'too easy.' However, critics argue that such changes disproportionately affect low-literacy applicants and those without access to preparation, and there is no evidence that current naturalization applicants lack shared values. USCIS has also increased scrutiny of applicants' moral character, requiring evidence of positive contributions and potentially interviewing coworkers or neighbors. These changes are part of a broader effort to limit immigration and settlement, sparking debate over fairness, accessibility, and the true criteria for citizenship.",
