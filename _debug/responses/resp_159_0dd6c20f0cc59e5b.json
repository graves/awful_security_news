  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically low despite a US-brokered ceasefire, with only 750 tonnes of food entering daily — far below the target of 2,000 tonnes. This is due to only two crossings — Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara — being operational, and the closure of the Rafah crossing until Hamas hands over more captives. The WFP has expanded its distribution network to 26 points, still short of the goal of 145, and has not been granted access to key areas like Salah al-Din Street. Residents are rationing food due to fears of renewed conflict, storing supplies for emergencies. The US and Israeli governments are closely linked to the humanitarian access framework, with humanitarian aid delivery dependent on prisoner exchange progress and the full implementation of the 20-point peace plan.",
