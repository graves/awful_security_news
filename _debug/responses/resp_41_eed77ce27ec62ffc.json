  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024, during a public event in Handlova. Cintula, a former mine worker and public activist, admitted to shooting Fico five times from close range, injuring him severely. The court ruled that the attack constituted terrorism due to the specific targeting of a political leader, citing Cintula’s stated opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and cultural issues. While Cintula claimed he did not want to kill and described the act as a 'scream against fear,' the defense argued that not all attacks on officials are terrorism. Fico, who returned to power in 2023 and implemented policies criticized by the opposition, has forgiven Cintula. The verdict underscores deep political and societal divisions in Slovakia, with accusations of democratic erosion from the opposition and claims of political extremism from Fico’s side.",
