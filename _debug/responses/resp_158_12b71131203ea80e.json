  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court convicted poet Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old pensioner from Levice, of a 'terror attack' for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a government meeting. Cintula claimed he acted out of 'moral despair' and sought to protest Fico’s government policies, including the suspension of military aid to Ukraine. The court reclassified the act from premeditated murder to a 'terror attack' due to political motivation. The incident has sparked widespread concern over political polarization, democratic erosion, and Slovakia’s growing alignment with Russia, as Fico has intensified criticism of the European Union and pushed for constitutional changes limiting same-sex rights and overriding EU law. Despite Fico’s claim of forgiveness, the event has deepened political divisions and ignited debates about power, dissent, and freedom in Slovakia.",
