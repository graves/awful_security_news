  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican mayoral candidate in New York City, is facing growing pressure from his boss John Catsimatidis and other Republicans to withdraw from the race, who argue Sliwa does not represent the city’s interests. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, has similarly urged Sliwa to drop out to consolidate opposition against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa, however, has dismissed these pressures, asserting that he represents blue-collar voters and that billionaire donors should not dictate the outcome of the election. Trump has mocked Sliwa for his affection for cats and animal rescues, adding to the political skepticism. Despite being labeled a 'shock jock' by Cuomo, Sliwa maintains his presence and relevance, with both Sliwa and Mamdani forming a rare alliance against donor-driven politics, signaling a shift in the city’s political dynamics.",
