  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Amazon delivery driver, Leah Cross, has sued the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that the agency unlawfully abandoned her sex discrimination case—stemming from Amazon's delivery schedule making it nearly impossible for female drivers to find bathroom breaks—following a Trump executive order that deprioritized 'disparate impact' liability. The EEOC, which enforces civil rights in the workplace, has dropped multiple cases under this new rule, including one involving Sheetz's hiring practices and others involving transgender workers. Cross claims the EEOC is violating its statutory duty under the 1991 Civil Rights Act by discarding cases without review, and she is seeking a court order to halt the policy and obtain a full list of discontinued cases. This case reflects a broader crisis of civil rights enforcement, as federal agencies shift policies based on political directives, undermining protections for women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals.",
