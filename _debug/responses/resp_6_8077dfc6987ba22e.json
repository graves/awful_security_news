  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tesla is projected to report strong third-quarter sales of nearly 500,000 vehicles, driven by a surge in U.S. EV purchases before the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit on October 1, 2025. However, this spike is unsustainable, with analysts expecting a significant drop in EV demand in the fourth quarter. The loss of the federal tax credit and the elimination of federal emissions penalties by the Trump administration in July 2025 have removed two key revenue streams—regulatory credit sales and tax incentives—threatening Tesla’s long-term profitability. Global competition, especially from Chinese automaker BYD, is also growing, contributing to a 13% decline in Tesla’s global EV sales in the first half of 2025. Meanwhile, Tesla’s strategic pivot toward self-driving technology and robotics, including the launch of robotaxi services, is gaining attention as a potential future growth path. Investors are closely watching Tesla’s earnings call and upcoming shareholder vote on a proposed CEO pay package that could award Elon Musk up to $1 trillion in stock.",
