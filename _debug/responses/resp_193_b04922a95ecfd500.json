  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A South Korean elementary school teacher, Myeong Jae-wan, was sentenced to life in prison for fatally stabbing an eight-year-old student, Kim Hae-neul, in Daejeon in February 2025. The incident occurred after Myeong lured the child into a classroom media room, where she attacked her with a weapon she had purchased. Myeong had previously taken a six-month leave due to depression, returned to school just 20 days later after being cleared by a doctor, and displayed violent behavior, including putting another teacher in a headlock. Police found that Myeong had planned to kill herself and a random child, and that she sustained a neck wound possibly self-inflicted. While prosecutors initially sought the death penalty due to the victim’s family’s request, the court ruled that the risk of reoffending was high but not conclusive, opting for life imprisonment. Myeong expressed deep remorse through dozens of letters and stated she would reflect on her mistakes. She has been required to wear an electronic tracking device for 30 years. The case prompted national outcry and led South Korean leaders to call for new safety measures in schools to prevent similar tragedies.",
