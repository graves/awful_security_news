    "Iceland, long considered free of mosquitoes due to its extreme cold, has confirmed the presence of mosquitoes in the wild for the first time.",
    "The mosquitoes discovered are of the species Culiseta annulata, which is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates.",
    "The discovery was made in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who initially noticed the insect at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The mosquitoes were collected and identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson from the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.",
    "This marks the first confirmed occurrence of mosquitoes in Iceland's natural environment, unlike a previous isolated case from an airplane in 2025.",
    "Theories for how the mosquitoes arrived include transport via ships or containers.",
    "Scientists are uncertain whether climate change directly caused the discovery, though warming temperatures may increase the potential for future mosquito establishment.",
    "Iceland has already experienced record-breaking heat due to climate change, raising concerns about ecological shifts.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson suggest that while climate change may have contributed, it is not yet clear if it directly caused this event.",
    "Further monitoring in spring 2026 will determine if the species can survive winter and establish a permanent population."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its harsh, cold climate, has officially confirmed the presence of wild mosquitoes in the wild for the first time. The discovery, made in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, involved three mosquitoes identified as Culiseta annulata, a species native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold conditions. The sighting was reported by Björn Hjaltason, who captured the insect at dusk on October 16, 2025, and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson. This marks the first documented occurrence of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment, unlike a prior isolated case found on a plane. Experts remain divided on whether climate change played a direct role, with some suggesting warming temperatures may allow future mosquito species to establish, while others note that such shifts are not yet fully understood. The event underscores broader concerns about climate change’s impact on ecosystems, though the link between warming and this specific discovery remains uncertain and requires further monitoring.",
