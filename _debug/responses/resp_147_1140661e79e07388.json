  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed expectations of a near-term Trump-Putin summit to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. Although President Trump previously announced plans to meet Putin in Hungary within two weeks, both the White House and Kremlin have clarified there are no immediate plans. The delay stems from a fundamental disagreement over ceasefire terms: Russia demands control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and the dismantling of its military, while Trump and Ukrainian leaders prefer a freeze of current battle lines. A phone call between US Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was held but deemed unnecessary, and Russia maintains that its position from the August Alaska summit remains unchanged. Ukraine and European leaders accuse Russia of stalling and continuing aggression, highlighting that only Ukraine is committed to peace. As a result, a direct meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is currently blocked by the Kremlin.",
