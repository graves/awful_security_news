  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the U.S. government shutdown continues, national parks like Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and those in West Virginia remain partially or fully open despite staff furloughs and closures of federal facilities. While some tourists and private museums benefit from increased access and visitors, advocates and local businesses warn of serious safety risks, including illegal activities like drone use and base jumping, trash accumulation, and vandalism. The absence of park rangers compromises emergency response, law enforcement, and visitor guidance. In West Virginia, state funding and political will have kept key parks open to protect tourism and local economies, especially during events like Bridge Day. Meanwhile, businesses in both West Virginia and D.C. report mixed impacts, with some unaffected and others facing declining demand. Advocacy groups are urging park closures to prioritize safety and preserve the integrity of national parks, warning that long-term impacts could include environmental damage, economic losses, and public risk.",
