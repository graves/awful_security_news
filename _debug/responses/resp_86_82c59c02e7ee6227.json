    "The Supreme Court agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, raising a critical question about the Second Amendment and whether such restrictions are historically grounded.",
    "The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Pakistan, who was prosecuted under the law for possessing a gun and marijuana and cocaine, with the government asserting his habitual drug use as a justification.",
    "A federal district court initially dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision emphasizing the need for historical precedent in gun prohibitions.",
    "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law cannot target habitual drug users, only those currently intoxicated or under the influence at the time of arrest.",
    "The Trump administration appealed this decision, claiming habitual drug users pose significant threats to public safety, especially when impaired and armed.",
    "The government also alleged that Hemani engaged in fraudulent activities linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and attended a celebration honoring Qasem Soleimani, a key Iranian official killed in a U.S. drone strike.",
    "Hemani’s legal team countered that the historical foundation for the law is weak and noted that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana use, suggesting a significant overlap between marijuana users and gun ownership.",
    "The case is notable as it is the second major gun-related case of the current Supreme Court term, following a prior decision on gun prohibitions in domestic abuse restraining orders.",
    "The case is also significant because President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding political dimension to the issue."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, focusing on whether such a restriction violates the Second Amendment. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistani citizen prosecuted in 2023 for possessing a gun, marijuana, and cocaine, with the government claiming his habitual drug use justifies the ban. A lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court ruling that requires gun prohibitions to have historical precedent, and the 5th Circuit upheld that precedent, ruling the law cannot target habitual users. The Trump administration appealed, arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially when impaired, and citing allegations that Hemani was involved in fraudulent activities linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and attended a celebration honoring Qasem Soleimani. Hemani’s legal team countered that the historical basis for the law is weak and noted that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana, suggesting a significant overlap between marijuana users and gun ownership. Notably, President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding political sensitivity. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in early 2026 and issue a decision by the end of June 2025.",
