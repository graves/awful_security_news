    "Virginia Giuffre, a key victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking network, claims in her posthumous memoir that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister'—a reference widely interpreted as Prince Andrew in both the US and UK versions of the memoir.",
    "The memoir alleges that Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and brother of King Charles, sexually assaulted Giuffre when she was 17, and that Epstein facilitated the encounter, describing it as being 'choked, beaten, and bloodied' and that the prince laughed when he hurt her.",

The memoir claims Andrew laughed during her abuse and that his team attempted to hire online trolls to discredit her during legal proceedings.
