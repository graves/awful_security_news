Acosta stated that the decision was made collectively by prosecutors and was intended to ensure Epstein served time and sent a clear signal that such conduct would not go unpunished. Despite acknowledging public criticism, he emphasized that his office's goal was to get Epstein into jail. Acosta also denied any role in selecting interviewees or knowledge of Trump’s connections to Epstein, and stated he resigned from the Labor Secretary role entirely on his own initiative. The House Oversight Committee’s investigation into Epstein, including closed-door testimony, reflects broader public demand for transparency in high-profile cases involving powerful figures.",
