  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is undergoing a major renovation as part of a $250 million project to build a new ballroom in the East Wing, which has been demolished to make way for the structure. President Donald Trump announced the project, claiming it will be 'near' but not touching the existing building and will respect its historical integrity. The project, privately funded by unidentified 'Patriots', is being managed by Clark Construction and designed by McCrery Architects. However, it has raised significant concerns from preservation groups like the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects, who argue that it bypasses standard review processes and represents the first major exterior change to the East Wing since 1942. The National Park Service has expressed alarm over the lack of transparency and due process, citing the building's global historical importance. Despite Trump's assurances of respect for the original structure, the project has sparked debate about the balance between modernization and historical preservation, echoing previous presidential changes to the White House while raising new questions about oversight and accountability.",
