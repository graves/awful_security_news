  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of AI-generated voice scams are targeting wealthy individuals, using deepfake technology to clone real voices—such as that of Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto—to solicit large financial transfers. The scam, which occurred in early 2025, involved fraudulent calls from fake government officials asking for money, with only one businessman, Massimo Moratti, transferring funds. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voices are now nearly indistinguishable from real human voices and are often rated as more trustworthy. Global losses from such scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. The technology also enables the creation of fake videos and illegal content, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material. In response, governments like the US and Australia have introduced laws criminalizing the distribution of AI-generated intimate images, highlighting the urgent need for public awareness, legal reform, and technological safeguards.",
