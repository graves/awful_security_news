  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s President Jose Jeri declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital Lima and the neighboring province of Callao in response to escalating crime and violent protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured. The emergency, approved by the Council of Ministers and effective just after midnight on October 21, 2025, authorizes the deployment of armed forces and police to restore public order. The move reflects Jeri’s commitment to addressing security concerns following his inauguration after the ousting of former President Dina Boluarte. This is not the first such declaration in Peru, with Boluarte previously imposing a similar measure in March, though experts note that repeated emergencies have not led to sustained improvements in crime levels. The crisis has also drawn attention from young civil society members, particularly Generation Z, who have called for stronger action against crime.",
