  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after being extradited from France and convicted of second-degree sexual assault for attacking Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College in 2013. The case, which had been dormant for over a decade, gained momentum after Cleary sent a Facebook message in 2019 stating 'So I raped you,' prompting Keeler to renew her efforts with law enforcement. Prosecutors had long been reluctant to file charges in campus sexual assault cases, and key evidence was destroyed over time. The victim, Shannon Keeler, described years of trauma and a sense of betrayal by the justice system, which failed to act despite her initial report. Cleary, who had a history of mental illness and lived in Silicon Valley before moving abroad, pleaded guilty and expressed remorse. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, acknowledged the horrific nature of the crime and recognized Cleary’s remorse and admission of guilt, resulting in a sentence below state guidelines. This case underscores the systemic failures in how sexual assault cases — particularly on college campuses — are handled, including delayed prosecution, loss of evidence, and lack of accountability.",
