  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is moving forward with a $250 million construction project to build a massive 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the East Wing, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates such projects. The demolition of part of the East Wing — the traditional base of operations for the first lady — is underway, with visible construction photos showing damage to the building façade. President Donald Trump has publicly promoted the project, citing a long-standing desire for a larger space and claiming it will accommodate up to 999 people, far exceeding the capacity of the East Room. The project, initially announced in July, includes private funding and a donation of an energy-efficient HVAC system from Carrier Global Corp. However, it has sparked controversy due to the lack of regulatory oversight, potential disruption to historic architecture, and the absence of formal review or public disclosure of funding sources. The White House claims the project does not interfere with the main mansion and will relocate offices temporarily, with completion expected before Trump’s term ends in January 2029.",
