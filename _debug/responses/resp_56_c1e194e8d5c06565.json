  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information, stemming from allegations that he shared thousands of pages of personal and classified emails with his wife and daughter via his personal email account. The investigation began in 2020 over concerns about his memoir containing classified material and was reignited in 2021 after an alleged Iranian hack of his AOL email. Prosecutors obtained search warrants in August 2025, leading to the seizure of documents labeled 'secret,' 'confidential,' and 'classified,' including references to weapons of mass destruction. The case gained support from career prosecutors, unlike politically driven cases such as those against James and Comey. While President Trump has repeatedly criticized Bolton, calling him a 'lowlife' and urging prosecution, the indictment was finalized after internal pressure and the success of similar cases. Bolton pleaded not guilty, asserting the case is a political weaponization of the Justice Department. The case exemplifies the intersection of national security, political power, and the weaponization of legal institutions under the Trump administration.",
