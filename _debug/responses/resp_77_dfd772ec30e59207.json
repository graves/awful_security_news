  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s defense ministry announced the expulsion from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army of two top military officials—He Weidong, the number two general and former Politburo member, and navy admiral Miao Hua, the former top political officer—on corruption charges. This marks the first time a sitting general on the Central Military Commission has been expelled since the Cultural Revolution, signaling a major escalation in the anti-corruption campaign that began in 2023. The actions reflect President Xi Jinping’s broader strategy of cleaning up the military and political elite, with He being particularly significant due to his long-standing ties to Xi and his role in planning military responses to U.S. actions, such as the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan. The purges are expected to be finalized at the upcoming Central Committee Fourth Plenum, and the removal of these high-ranking officials strengthens Xi’s control over both party and military leadership.",
