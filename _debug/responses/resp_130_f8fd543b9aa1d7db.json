  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government shutdown is entering its fourth week, becoming one of the longest in history, with widespread disruption to essential services and economic activity. President Donald Trump hosts Republican senators for a lunch event at the White House, emphasizing that the shutdown must end and that health care negotiations will not occur until the government reopens. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, reject any talks on health care funding until the closure ends. Key federal programs such as Head Start and WIC face potential funding cuts, and agencies like the National Nuclear Security Administration and FAA report furloughs and operational disruptions. The expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies on December 31, 2025, threatens to spike health care costs, prompting public anxiety and urgent calls from Democrats for action before the November 1 enrollment period begins. Economists warn of a 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point weekly decline in economic growth, with small business loan programs and insurance renewals also halted. The article underscores a political standoff between parties, with the broader implications of cost, access, and governance reaching millions of Americans.",
