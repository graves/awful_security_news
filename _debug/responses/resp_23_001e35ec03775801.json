  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran, particularly from 2012 to 2019, have severely undermined the country’s middle class—historically a driving force for political reform, stability, and economic growth. A study using a synthetic control method found that without sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have grown by 17%, but instead, it shrank by 28%, with an estimated 9 million people losing middle-class status. Rising inflation (42.4%), soaring prices of basic goods, and limited access to fuel and employment have pushed millions into poverty, while a small elite benefits from luxury lifestyles. The erosion of the middle class has shifted political engagement from demands for rights and reform to urgent cries for survival, weakening long-term democratic participation. Sanctions have also strengthened state-linked institutions like the IRGC and bonyads, entrenching hardline power. As a result, the Iranian economy remains fragile, and the recovery of the middle class is described as a generational challenge, even if sanctions are lifted.",
