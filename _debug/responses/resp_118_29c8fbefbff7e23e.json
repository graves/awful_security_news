  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a close and highly charged gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has gained support from President Donald Trump. Despite New Jersey's typically blue political leanings, the state has a history of electing governors from both parties. The race is marked by personal attacks, including Sherrill accusing Ciattarelli of downplaying opioid risks and causing mass deaths, and Ciattarelli blaming Sherrill for being barred from walking at her Navy Academy graduation. Both candidates emphasize affordability, with rising electricity costs—up 17–20% in June—highlighting a major voter concern. Sherrill has received endorsements from former President Barack Obama and is supported by local leaders like Camden Mayor Victor Carstarphen, who praises her plans to address energy costs. Ciattarelli, who previously criticized Trump in 2016, has gained national backing from Trump and appeals to voters concerned about taxes and budget management. Experts note that while personal attacks are intense, affordability remains the primary issue driving voter decisions. The outcome could signal a shift in New Jersey’s political landscape, potentially marking the first time since the 1960s a governor from the same party serves three consecutive terms.",
