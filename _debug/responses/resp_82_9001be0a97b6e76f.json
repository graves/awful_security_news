  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors from the Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s eligibility to represent James Comey, arguing that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017 during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The prosecutors claim that communications between Comey and Fitzgerald, including memos about their interactions with President Trump, contain evidence of improper disclosure. Fitzgerald and Comey’s attorneys dispute this, asserting that the memos were unclassified at the time of sharing and that the government later upclassified them, which does not retroactively change their original status. Experts, including former prosecutor Elie Honig, highlight the legal principle that a party cannot be both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case, raising serious ethical and procedural concerns about Fitzgerald’s role.",
