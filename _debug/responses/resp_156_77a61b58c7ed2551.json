The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range was particularly vulnerable, with communities isolated and homes destroyed. Authorities responded with over 8,700 military personnel and extensive humanitarian aid, including emergency shelters, food, and medical supplies. The return of La Niña weather patterns is linked to increased rainfall, raising broader climate concerns. The situation underscores the vulnerability of Mexico to extreme weather events, especially in regions with complex topography and poor flood resilience.",
