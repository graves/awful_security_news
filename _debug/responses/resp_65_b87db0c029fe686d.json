  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities, is urging widespread vaccination to combat declining public trust and rising outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio. They criticize federal officials—such as former President Donald Trump and CDC advisory panels—for making false claims about vaccine safety and altering recommended immunization schedules, which they argue undermines public health. A growing measles outbreak in South Carolina, involving over 100 unvaccinated students, underscores the urgency of the issue. Local health leaders emphasize that public health decisions must be science-based, not politically driven, and highlight declining public trust in federal agencies like the CDC, which has dropped to 50% in recent polls. Despite this, the coalition remains committed to protecting community health through coordinated, data-driven messaging and cross-jurisdictional cooperation, as local health systems are interconnected and vulnerable to outbreak spread.",
