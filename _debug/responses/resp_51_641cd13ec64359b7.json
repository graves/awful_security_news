  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted that Ukraine make territorial concessions, particularly in the Donbas region, to end the war. Despite claims from Trump that the ceasefire should be at current battle lines, European officials and Ukrainian sources noted the tension, with Trump reportedly raising his voice and expressing frustration. Zelensky, while critical of Trump’s demands, acknowledged the meeting as a pointed conversation that could help bring the war to an end. The meeting follows Trump’s earlier calls with Putin, who proposed a territorial swap involving Donbas for southern Ukrainian regions. Trump later clarified he did not demand full surrender of Donbas, stating that 78% of Ukrainian land is already occupied. The incident reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to ending the war, influenced by his success in brokering a Gaza truce and concerns over civilian casualties and the war’s devastation. While Trump and Zelensky left with a shared understanding of a ceasefire at current battle lines, the meeting highlighted deep disagreements over the path to peace and Ukraine’s territorial integrity.",
