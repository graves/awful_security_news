  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The ongoing government shutdown in 2025 has led to widespread disruptions in national park operations, with many rangers and employees furloughed and visitor centers closed. Despite this, tourists continue to visit key destinations like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite, with some parks relying on state funding to remain open. While some local businesses report no immediate impact, others, such as Mountain Mama cabins, see a 30% drop in bookings, highlighting economic vulnerability. Safety concerns have increased due to unregulated activities like drone flying and base jumping, as well as trash and vandalism, which park staff and advocacy groups warn could compromise emergency response and park safety. Simultaneously, private museums in Washington, DC have seen record visitor numbers due to closures of the Smithsonian and National Zoo. Advocacy groups are urging national parks to close during the shutdown to protect public safety and maintain environmental integrity, especially given the absence of staffing and enforcement capabilities.",
