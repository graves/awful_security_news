  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In September 2025, a peaceful religious display of 'I love Muhammad' in Syed Nagar, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, sparked a government crackdown. The sign was removed after Hindu groups objected to its placement at a site traditionally used for Hindu festivals. Subsequent charges were filed against 24 individuals, including nine Muslims and 15 unidentified persons, under laws targeting religious enmity and public order. This was followed by similar actions in Bareilly, where a protest led by Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan was met with police suppression, internet shutdown, and arrests. The Uttar Pradesh government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, has systematically targeted Muslim religious expression through arrests, property demolitions, and political rhetoric, raising concerns over violations of constitutional secularism and due process. Human rights groups and opposition parties have condemned the actions as hate politics and extralegal punishment, especially given that Hindu communities are allowed to promote similar religious messages without consequence.",
