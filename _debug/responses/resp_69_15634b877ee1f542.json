  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is engaging in aggressive foreign policy actions toward Venezuela, including military posturing such as Navy buildup and B-52 bomber flights, and authorizing covert CIA operations. These actions, which may signal a push for regime change, are politically and diplomatically fraught. While Trump claims Venezuela is threatening the U.S. through drug trafficking, such allegations have been widely challenged and dismissed. Public opinion, as shown by multiple polls, reflects deep skepticism about U.S. military intervention, especially unilateral or regime-changing operations. The situation raises concerns that Trump's actions could backfire politically, as Americans are largely opposed to such foreign adventures, particularly when they involve U.S. troops and lack international cooperation.",
