  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legitimacy of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, which the Department of Justice claims is lawful under delegation of authority by the Attorney General. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, initially served as interim US attorney, then was appointed as a special attorney and later granted full authority through delegation. However, a lower court ruled her appointment violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which requires Senate confirmation or at least 90 days of DOJ service for such appointments. DOJ lawyer Henry Whitaker argues that such delegation is a recognized and common practice, even if not explicitly required by law, and that 16 US attorneys have recently been confirmed under normal procedures. In contrast, legal counsel Abbe Lowell contends that delegating full powers—including personnel decisions and public representation—is unprecedented and unlawful. The case is part of a broader pattern of challenges to US attorney appointments in Nevada and the Central District of California, raising concerns about executive overreach and political obstruction. The legal debate highlights tensions between executive branch efficiency and congressional oversight, with implications for the structure and accountability of federal law enforcement leadership.",
