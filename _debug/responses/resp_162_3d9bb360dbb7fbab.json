This shortfall, driven by a projected 30% budget reduction starting in 2026, threatens critical vaccination and surveillance activities. To address the crisis, the GPEI will concentrate efforts on high-risk areas like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where wild polio cases have been reported, and will adopt innovative strategies such as fractional dosing to conserve vaccine supplies. Meanwhile, cases of vaccine-derived polio have increased in 149 countries, including Nigeria, emphasizing the importance of continued vaccination and monitoring. Despite these challenges, experts maintain that polio eradication remains feasible if global partners remain committed.",
