    "The Net Zero Framework would have been the first global carbon-pricing system for shipping, charging $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2-equivalent emissions.",
    "Support for the framework was initially strong among 63 IMO members, including China, the EU, Brazil, Britain, and others, but was weakened after Trump’s intervention.",
    "Countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed the measure, while Argentina and Singapore shifted from support to opposition after the threat.",
    "The decision was criticized by climate advocates, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, as a missed opportunity for climate action.",
    "The shipping industry faces growing climate-related risks, including more frequent storms and changing ocean currents, making emissions reduction urgent.",
    "Proposed solutions include using cleaner fuels like ammonia and methanol and retrofitting ships with special sails to reduce carbon emissions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed formal approval of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions and incentivized cleaner fuels, was initially approved in April 2025 by 63 IMO members. However, following Trump’s public criticism and threats of economic penalties on supporting nations, delegates in London voted to postpone adoption, with 57 in favor and 49 opposed. The move has been widely criticized by climate leaders, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, as a missed opportunity to advance decarbonization in shipping. Countries like China, the EU, and the UK had previously backed the plan, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted opposition, highlighting the political influence of fossil fuel advocacy and U.S. foreign policy on global climate action.",
