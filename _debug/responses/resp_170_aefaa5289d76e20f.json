  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) by 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The NZF, which would have introduced a global carbon tax of $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was initially approved in April 2025. Trump's public backlash and threats of economic penalties influenced delegates in London to vote in favor of a delay, despite support from major nations like China, the EU, and Brazil. Countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed the framework, while Argentina and Singapore reversed their previous support. The decision undermines global climate action and creates uncertainty for the shipping industry, which urgently needs investment and policy clarity to decarbonize. Experts and climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s minister and UN Secretary-General Guterres, condemned the delay as a setback to climate goals and maritime sustainability.",
