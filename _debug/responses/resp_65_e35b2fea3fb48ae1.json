  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Electricity bills across the U.S. are rising due to a surge in demand from AI-driven data centers. This demand is fueled by massive investments from tech companies like Meta and Microsoft, and partnerships such as OpenAI and Broadcom's plan to build 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips. The Department of Energy projects data centers will consume 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. Experts note that electricity pricing models have not adapted to this rise in demand, leading to higher costs for residential consumers. While some states like Oregon have introduced legislation to require data centers to pay for grid strain, the broader trend reflects a significant shift in energy consumption patterns tied to artificial intelligence growth.",
