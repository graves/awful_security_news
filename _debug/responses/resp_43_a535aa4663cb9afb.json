  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' access to long-term one-on-one mental health therapy through the Veterans Affairs (VA) system is being severely restricted under new policies implemented since 2021, particularly under VA Secretary Doug Collins. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell report being abruptly cut off from therapy, despite having chronic conditions such as PTSD that require ongoing care. Providers including Stephen Long and Mark Jorges have resigned due to pressure to enforce rigid session limits, citing lack of clinical appropriateness. While the VA claims no limits exist and emphasizes shared decision-making, internal reports and provider testimonies indicate a shift toward standardized, short-term care, often without patient or provider input. Critics, including the American Psychological Association, argue that such policies undermine recovery and trust, especially for veterans with lifelong mental health needs. Veterans express deep distress, feeling abandoned and re-traumatized, and many are unable to transition to group therapy or alternative options. The policy has sparked a broader debate about access, equity, and the ethical responsibilities of the VA in delivering individualized mental health care.",
