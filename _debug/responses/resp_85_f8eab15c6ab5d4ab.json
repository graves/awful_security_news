The rebels confiscated all communication equipment, including phones and servers, and have previously claimed (without evidence) that the staff are spies, a claim the UN has firmly denied. This incident follows a broader campaign of detentions—over 50 UN staff have been arrested in Yemen, including the death of a WFP worker in Saada earlier in the year. As a result, the UN has suspended operations in Saada and relocated its top humanitarian coordinator to Aden, underscoring the deteriorating conditions for humanitarian operations in conflict-affected areas of Yemen.",
