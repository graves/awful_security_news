  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central shows that even under current Paris Agreement commitments, the planet will still experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures. The study attributes this to 2.6°C of warming, down from a worst-case 4°C scenario that would have added 114 such days. Since 2015, the world has already seen 11 extra superhot days on average. The impact is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive spikes in heat exposure—Panama alone projected to gain 149 extra days—while top emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days, despite producing 42% of global emissions. Experts warn that this disparity reflects a deep injustice and may contribute to future geopolitical instability.",
