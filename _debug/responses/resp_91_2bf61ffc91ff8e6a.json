  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information after a five-year investigation that began with concerns over his 2020 memoir and was reignited in 2021 by an alleged Iranian hack of his AOL email account. The investigation, led by career prosecutors including Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara and supported by FBI officials such as Kash Patel, culminated in a search of Bolton’s home and office in August 2025, where documents labeled 'confidential' and 'classified' were found. Prosecutors allege that Bolton shared over a thousand pages of personal and daily activity information through personal email with his wife and daughter. Despite political pressure from President Trump, who repeatedly criticized Bolton and called for prosecution, the case was built on evidence and institutional review, with support from career prosecutors. The final indictment was presented in a brief, secretive grand jury proceeding, and Bolton has pleaded not guilty, asserting that the charges are politically motivated and part of a broader effort to intimidate political opponents.",
