  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in 20 years, has won a decisive victory in a presidential runoff election, marking a dramatic shift from decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Winning 54.5% of the vote, Paz has pledged to rebuild relations with the United States, especially with the Trump administration, and to address Bolivia’s severe economic crisis by rejecting an IMF bailout and securing fuel imports. He is implementing a targeted fuel subsidy reform, shifting universal support to direct cash transfers for the poor, while maintaining stable prices for transport workers. His campaign partner, Edman Lara, a former police officer with a viral social media presence, helped mobilize rural and working-class voters. The new government faces challenges, including maintaining trust among Indigenous communities, who were historically empowered under Evo Morales, and managing domestic unrest over allegations of electoral fraud. With a $3.5 billion loan already approved and efforts underway to secure another $600 million, Paz aims to stabilize the economy and restore public confidence in institutions through reforms, including judicial overhauls, before making broader economic promises.",
