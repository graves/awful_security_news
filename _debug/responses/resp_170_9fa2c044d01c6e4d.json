    "The Nobel Prizes are among the world's most prestigious awards, established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895 to honor individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "The prizes are awarded annually in six categories: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics (in memory of Nobel), each administered by a specific institution.",
    "In 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Prize in Economic Sciences, expanding the number of categories to six.",
    "This year’s medicine prize was awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, which have laid the foundation for new treatments in cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The 2024 medicine prize was awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for discovering microRNAs, which regulate gene expression.",
    "The 2024 physics prize went to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational work in machine learning and artificial neural networks.",
    "The 2024 chemistry prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, including the AI system AlphaFold.",
    "The 2024 literature prize was awarded to Han Kang for her poetic exploration of violence and collective trauma.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize for Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, who were honored for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance with significant implications for cancer and autoimmune disease treatments. The awards continue through the week, with each prize announced by its respective institution and reflecting advancements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace. The article highlights the prestige and global significance of the Nobel Prizes, rooted in Alfred Nobel’s original vision of recognizing humanity's greatest contributions. It also discusses the political controversy surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of deserving the peace prize, with experts noting that such claims are unlikely due to the prize's emphasis on durable peace and institutional work. Additionally, the article underscores the integrity of the nomination process, including the secrecy of nominations and the 50-year review period, and emphasizes the role of academic freedom, especially in light of political interference. The historical context of past winners—including Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun in medicine, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton in physics, and Han Kang in literature—illustrates the enduring impact of scientific and literary achievements on society.",
