  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial demonstrated that early exposure to peanuts in infancy reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research shows that real-world implementation of medical guidelines — first issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017 — has led to a significant decline in peanut allergy rates in U.S. children. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and analyzing electronic health records, found that peanut allergy rates dropped by over 27% and more than 40% after the guidelines were introduced. Approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial hesitancy among pediatricians and allergists, adoption has increased, and current guidance (updated in 2021) recommends introducing peanuts and other allergens between four and six months of age without screening. Experts and advocates, including FARE and dietitian Tiffany Leon, emphasize the importance of safe, small exposures such as peanut butter and yogurt to build immune tolerance.",
