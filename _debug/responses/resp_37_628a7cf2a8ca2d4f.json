  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) that would warn of a link between its use during pregnancy and increased risks of autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such a connection exists, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children and a comprehensive review of 46 studies—has not established a causal relationship. The FDA maintains that there is no clear evidence of harm from appropriate use, and international agencies including the EU, UK, and Health Canada have affirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that proposed labeling changes are arbitrary, unsupported by evidence, and inconsistent with decades of research, and has formally petitioned the FDA to deny a citizen’s petition that would require such warnings. The controversy underscores a broader tension between public health messaging, political influence, and scientific consensus.",
