  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sean Grayson, a Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy, is on trial for the murder of Sonya Massey, a Black woman who was shot in her Springfield home on July 6, 2024, after a confrontation over a pan of hot water. Body camera footage shows Grayson entering the home, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, and firing three times after she picked up the pan. Massey, a single mother with a history of mental health issues, had previously been admitted to a mental health program and made multiple 911 calls reporting a mental breakdown. Grayson, who had a prior DUI conviction and a history of poor performance in past policing roles, was unaware of her mental health history. The incident sparked national outrage, prompting Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to sign legislation requiring full background transparency for all law enforcement candidates. The trial was moved from Springfield to Peoria for security reasons, and jury selection began with intense questioning about attitudes toward police use of force—no juror said they believed officers could use any level of force as necessary. The case has become a focal point for discussions on racial bias, law enforcement accountability, and mental health in policing.",
