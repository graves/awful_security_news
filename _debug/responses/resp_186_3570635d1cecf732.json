  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff faced intense backlash for suggesting that President Donald Trump should deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco, a statement that sparked criticism from Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. The comment, made ahead of the Dreamforce conference, led to the cancellation of key appearances and a resignation from the Salesforce Foundation board by venture capitalist Ron Conway. Though Benioff issued a public apology, stating his remarks were made out of 'abundance of caution' and expressing regret for the concern caused, the incident highlights the growing tension between tech leaders and political movements, especially when it comes to military interventions in urban centers. It also reflects broader concerns about the role of tech companies in political and civic affairs, with Salesforce reportedly supporting ICE hiring efforts during a national immigration crackdown. The controversy is emblematic of the political volatility surrounding federal military deployments in cities with progressive governance, and underscores the risk of tech executives becoming politically exposed in times of national division.",
