The heist, executed in just seven minutes using a disc-cutter and a truck with an elevating platform, is described as the most serious security breach at the Louvre since the 1911 Mona Lisa disappearance. The items, primarily from the 19th century, were part of France’s surviving royal regalia, with one crown of Empress Eugénie recovered damaged. The theft reflects a growing trend of organized crime targeting valuable, sellable cultural artifacts, following prior incidents involving gold and porcelain. Authorities, including Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, have acknowledged the vulnerability of French museums and are implementing new security measures. The thieves' primary goal is to dismantle and sell the jewels, which can be easily cut and monetized, underscoring the economic motive behind such crimes.",
