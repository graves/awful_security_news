  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a massive general strike and protest movement in Gabes, Tunisia, shut down shops, schools, and public services in response to severe environmental pollution from the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents and labor leaders, including the UGTT, have accused the plant—operating since 1972—of causing widespread health issues such as respiratory illness and cancer, as well as ecological collapse. Despite a 2017 pledge to phase out the plant, authorities have instead increased production, citing economic importance. Over 200 people have been hospitalized due to gas exposure, and protests have intensified, with demonstrators calling for the plant’s immediate shutdown. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination,' and Chinese companies have been brought in to manage emissions. The unrest represents one of the most significant tests of governance and public trust since Saied assumed expanded powers in 2021.",
