  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman missing for two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia. Authorities say an anonymous tip led them to re-inspect the site, where they found the remains confirmed by DNA testing. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. Evidence includes King’s cellphone signals tracking to locations tied to Scott’s disappearance and video footage showing a stolen black Hyundai Accent parked near the site the night she went missing. The car was later found on fire and disposed of at a junkyard. Prosecutors say King may have been involved in the kidnapping and the vehicle fire, and that other individuals may be involved. Although King was previously arrested in a different case with dropped charges, this case is being pursued with serious legal implications, and District Attorney Larry Krasner has stated that homicide charges could follow after due process. Scott’s parents described her as kind and full of spirit, and her family expressed profound grief over her loss.",
