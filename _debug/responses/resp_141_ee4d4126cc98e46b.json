  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the planet will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of extreme heat—due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the pre-Paris scenario of 114 such days, thanks to the Paris Climate Agreement’s influence. However, the study reveals a stark global inequity: small island nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in dangerous heat, despite contributing only 1% of global emissions. In contrast, top emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra superhot days. Experts warn that this imbalance could deepen global inequalities and threaten geopolitical stability, while emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by extreme heat, with thousands dying annually in heatwaves.",
