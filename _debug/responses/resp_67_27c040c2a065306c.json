  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The widespread resurgence of cowboy imagery in fashion, media, and politics reflects a deeper cultural trend rooted in American nostalgia, conservatism, and political messaging. While cowboy aesthetics have long been romanticized in film and entertainment — from Buffalo Bill shows to John Wayne films — today’s ubiquity is driven by political figures like Donald Trump and cultural shifts toward traditional values. The trend is especially visible in fashion (Vogue, Canada Goose), television ('Yellowstone', '1923'), and music (Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter'), where the cowboy symbolizes patriotism, rugged individualism, and anti-urban sentiment. However, this image is historically inaccurate: real cowboys were primarily Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans, and their contributions have been long overlooked. Recent efforts by photographers like Gabriela Hasbun and cultural events like the Bill Pickett Rodeo highlight the diversity and vitality of Black cowboy culture. Despite this, mainstream media and political discourse continue to 'whitewash' the narrative, prioritizing a romantic, idealized version of the cowboy over historical truth. The article underscores how cultural myths are repeatedly cycled and rebranded, serving both entertainment and political agendas, even as real-world realities remain marginalized.",
