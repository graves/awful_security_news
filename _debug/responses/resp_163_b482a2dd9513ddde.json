  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) began at 07:11 GMT on October 20, 2025, originating from a flawed technical update to DynamoDB’s API in AWS’s Virginia data center. This error caused a DNS failure, preventing apps from connecting to server addresses and triggering a cascading failure across 113 AWS services. The disruption impacted widely used platforms including Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, banks, media companies, e-commerce sites, and smart home devices like Ring and Alexa. Although AWS restored all services by 10:11 GMT, users faced delays and a backlog of messages. Experts confirmed that the outage stemmed from human error, not a cyberattack, and emphasized that while cloud outages are common, their scale reflects the deep integration of cloud infrastructure into daily digital life. AWS’s market dominance and rapid recovery capabilities suggest minimal long-term customer impact.",
