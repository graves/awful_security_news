  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, published a posthumous memoir alleging that she was raped by a man she described as a 'well-known Prime Minister' — widely interpreted as Prince Andrew — during her teenage years. The memoir claims the abuse involved choking, beating, and psychological torture, with the perpetrator laughing during the assault and becoming aroused. Giuffre alleges that Prince Andrew, despite denying any contact, maintained ties with Epstein and paid millions to settle a civil case. The article highlights that Prince Andrew's public claims of severing ties with Epstein are contradicted by emails showing continued contact in 2011. It also reveals that Andrew’s team reportedly tried to hire online trolls to discredit Giuffre and that the Metropolitan Police are investigating a report that Andrew asked a bodyguard to dig up dirt on her. These revelations intensify a transatlantic scandal surrounding powerful figures' connections to Epstein and deepen the disgrace surrounding Prince Andrew, who has since stepped down from using the title Duke of York but retained the title Prince.",
