  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A coalition of seven major U.S. universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and the University of Arizona — has rejected a proposed federal funding compact from the Trump administration. The compact, originally sent to nine institutions on October 1, 2025, offers preferential access to federal grants in exchange for policy changes such as eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting biologically defined gender standards. Universities argue that such mandates threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research innovation. The White House frames the compact as a way to promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and improve national higher education outcomes, but critics warn it risks politicizing academia. While seven schools have formally declined, others like the University of Texas at Austin remain undecided, and the proposed deadline for initial sign-ons is November 21, 2025. The controversy highlights a broader national debate over the role of federal government in shaping campus culture and academic governance.",
