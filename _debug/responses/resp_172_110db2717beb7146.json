  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas of Pará. The investigation highlights critical gaps in Brazil’s cattle tracking system—specifically, the absence of individual animal records in the Guias de Trânsito Animal (GTA) system—enabling a 'laundering' process where illegally deforested cattle are moved through the supply chain without traceability. Despite JBS’s past promises to trace its suppliers, including a 2009 commitment under the G4 Cattle Agreement, it has failed to deliver. The report documents encroachments in protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where illegal ranchers have operated with impunity, often with the approval of state agency Adepará. Pará, which has seen a 421% increase in deforestation in 2024, is a major hotspot for land grabs, threatening Indigenous communities and biodiversity. While reforms are underway—including a 2023 decree from Pará’s governor and a federal plan by the Ministry of Agriculture to implement traceability by 2032—advocacy groups argue that these timelines are too slow and that greater government oversight and public access to data are urgently needed to hold companies like JBS accountable.",
