She attributes the party's 2024 electoral loss to internal disunity, citing public skepticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney, and highlights the underrepresentation of Black women in political representation. Jean-Pierre also emphasizes the political vulnerability revealed during the June 2024 presidential debate, where concerns about former President Biden’s health intensified public scrutiny. She argues that Democrats failed to unify behind Biden and overlooked the loyalty and representation of marginalized communities. Ultimately, her decision to identify as independent is framed not as a betrayal but as a call for accountability, transparency, and reimagining the future of American politics to be more inclusive and responsive.",
