  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New tariffs imposed by the US government, particularly targeting imported kitchen cabinets, timber, furniture, steel, and copper, are increasing construction and renovation costs across the United States. Homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera, who started building in March, have seen their budgets balloon from $300,000 to $450,000 due to rising prices. Businesses such as RH and IKEA are facing financial strain, with RH reporting $30 million in new tariff costs and IKEA warning of potential price hikes. Even domestic firms like Colony and Stillfried Design are affected by imported material costs. Experts like Peter Harrell and Matthew Walsh warn that the housing market, already weakened by high mortgage rates, is now facing additional headwinds. Consumers are expected to bear up to 55% of the tariff costs, with price increases likely to be passed on in the coming months. While not a standalone crisis, the cumulative effect of multiple tariffs threatens affordability and growth in new housing construction, especially for low-cost, accessible housing projects.",
