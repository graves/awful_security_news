    "Cognitive training for 30 minutes daily increased acetylcholine levels by 2.3% in the anterior cingulate cortex in older adults.",
    "Acetylcholine decline is typically 2.5% per decade with age, so a 2.3% increase may represent a reversal equivalent to about 10 years of aging.",
    "The study included 92 healthy individuals aged 65 or older, with half engaged in scientifically tested cognitive exercises (BrainHQ) and the other half playing video games (e.g., Solitaire, Candy Crush).",
    "Only the cognitive training group showed increased acetylcholine levels; the video game group had no change.",
    "Increases were also observed in the hippocampus, a key area for memory.",
    "The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal JMIR Serious Games.",
    "Neuroscientist Michael Hasselmo notes that even modest changes in acetylcholine can significantly improve memory and thinking, and that early Alzheimer’s drugs worked by boosting acetylcholine.",
    "Acetylcholine is crucial for learning, attention, and memory; blocking it leads to delirium, showing its fundamental role in cognition."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 10-week study of 92 older adults (65+) found that intensive cognitive training using scientifically validated exercises like those in BrainHQ increased acetylcholine levels by 2.3% in key brain regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. In contrast, participants playing video games like Solitaire or Candy Crush showed no change. This increase—equivalent to reversing about 10 years of age-related decline—demonstrates that mental exercise can produce measurable, biologically meaningful changes in brain chemistry. The research, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in JMIR Serious Games, suggests that cognitive training may offer a non-pharmaceutical way to slow cognitive aging and potentially prevent decline similar to early Alzheimer’s treatments that increase acetylcholine levels.",
