Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded by calling for urgent European assistance, including air defense systems like the Patriot and long-range missiles to target Russian facilities such as the Bryansk Chemical Plant. He also urged the European Union to use frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—as a loan to fund Ukraine’s war effort, a move the Kremlin has denounced as illegal. Analysts note a pattern where shifts in US pressure—especially from President Donald Trump—lead to Russian escalation. Ukraine remains vigilant about a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, fearing it could be used as a diplomatic tool. Despite these challenges, Zelensky maintains that Ukraine remains the only serious party committed to peace, and that even under pressure, the situation is not hopeless.",
