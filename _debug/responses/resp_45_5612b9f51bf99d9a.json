  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major cultural and religious festival celebrated by over a billion people across India, Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji, and other South Asian diaspora communities. The festival, marking the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil, spans five days with distinct traditions: Dhanteras, Choti Diwali, Diwali (Lakshmi Puja), Padwa, and Bhai Dooj. While rooted in Hindu mythology — such as the return of Rama and Sita or Krishna’s defeat of Narakasura — Diwali is also observed by Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, each with unique historical narratives, including Guru Hargobind’s liberation from imprisonment and Lord Mahavira’s enlightenment. The festival includes rituals like lighting diyas, creating rangolis, exchanging gifts, and feasting. Diwali also marks the beginning of the new Hindu financial year, and traditions like gambling (e.g., teen patti) and home cleaning reflect its deep cultural significance. The article highlights both the spiritual richness and the universal, inclusive nature of Diwali as a celebration of community, prosperity, and renewal.",
