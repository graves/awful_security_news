  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines Donald Trump’s contrasting success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, achieved through diplomatic pressure enabled by Israel’s attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar, versus his repeated and unsuccessful attempts to resolve the war in Ukraine. While Trump has strong influence over Israeli leaders due to his long-standing support and political ties, he lacks equivalent leverage in Ukraine, where his threats to impose sanctions on Russia and offer weapons to Ukraine have had little effect. A proposed summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest has been canceled, and Trump’s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been tense and inconclusive, with Zelensky noting that Russian disinterest in diplomacy follows the withdrawal of long-range military support. Trump’s belief in in-person deal-making may be exploited by Putin as a strategic tactic, and his campaign promise to end the war in hours has been abandoned due to the war’s complexity and the unwillingness of either side to make significant concessions.",
