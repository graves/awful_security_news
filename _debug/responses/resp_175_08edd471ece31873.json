  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A BBC Panorama undercover investigation over seven months has revealed widespread misogyny, racism, and dismissive behavior by police officers in England, particularly in domestic abuse and sexual violence cases. Over 300 individuals, including women of colour, have come forward with stories of being belittled, mocked, or told to 'grow a pair' by officers. Key incidents include a Metropolitan Police officer dismissing a pregnant woman's rape allegation with 'That's what she says' and officers failing to act on breaches of court orders. The National Police Chiefs' Council and College of Policing have responded by promoting training programs like Domestic Abuse Matters and pledging to improve vetting and misconduct procedures. Policing Minister Sarah Jones affirmed the government's commitment to addressing gross misconduct. Victims report that the experience of reporting abuse to police has often worsened their trauma, with many stating they would never call the police again. The article underscores deep systemic issues that persist despite decades of policy efforts and calls for urgent reform to restore trust in law enforcement.",
