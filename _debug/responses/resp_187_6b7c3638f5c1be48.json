  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new blood test developed by Grail, known as the Galleri test, has shown promising results in detecting over 50 types of cancer, including those with no current screening programs such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancers. In a one-year trial involving 25,000 adults from the US and Canada, the test identified more than half of cancers at an early, treatable stage, with over 99% accuracy in ruling out cancer in negative cases. The test correctly identified cancer origin in nine out of ten cases and, when combined with standard screenings, increased overall detection by seven times. The results suggest the test could fundamentally shift cancer screening practices. However, experts stress the need for more evidence—particularly from randomized trials showing reduced cancer mortality—to confirm that earlier detection leads to better outcomes. The UK National Screening Committee will review the evidence, and if successful, the NHS may extend the test to one million people.",
