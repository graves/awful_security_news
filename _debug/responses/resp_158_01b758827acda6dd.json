  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge systems—such as recognizing unusual weather patterns, animal behavior, and using sound signals like gunfire—are being relied upon to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially when government early warning systems fail. Despite a $37 million investment in the GLOF-II project since 2017, these systems have been criticized for malfunctioning, lack of real-time integration, and poor community engagement. Residents report that warnings have come from local shepherds, like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, who use traditional methods to alert villagers, resulting in safe evacuations and no casualties. This reliance on human-based, culturally embedded knowledge highlights a critical gap in Pakistan’s climate resilience strategy: the lack of trust in official systems due to inconsistent performance and poor communication, even as the country faces increasing climate threats due to rising temperatures and glacier melt.",
