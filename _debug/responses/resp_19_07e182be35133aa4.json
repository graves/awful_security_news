  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and VA mental health providers are raising alarms over a policy shift under the Trump-era VA Secretary Doug Collins that abruptly limits long-term one-on-one therapy sessions. Despite the VA's official stance that it works with patients to plan care and that there are no set limits, providers report being pressured to end therapy prematurely—often without clinical justification. Veterans with chronic conditions like PTSD say they are being abandoned, re-traumatized, and forced into less effective alternatives like group therapy. Some providers have faced disciplinary action for challenging the policy, contributing to staff turnover and a worsening mental health care crisis. Experts, including the APA, emphasize that individualized, recovery-oriented care based on shared decision-making is essential, especially for conditions requiring lifelong treatment. The article highlights a systemic conflict between policy enforcement and clinical need, raising serious questions about access, equity, and patient trust in VA mental health services.",
