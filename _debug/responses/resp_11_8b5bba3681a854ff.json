  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign applicants requiring H-1B visas following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on these high-skilled work visas. This decision reflects growing corporate concerns about rising costs and reduced access to global talent, especially affecting skilled workers from India, who have historically dominated H-1B applications. While the Trump administration argues the fee targets abuse in the H-1B program, critics warn it could harm U.S. competitiveness in tech and e-commerce, where companies like Walmart and Amazon rely heavily on foreign skilled labor. The policy shift signals a broader trend of major employers adapting to restrictive immigration policies, with potential ripple effects across the U.S. economy and innovation landscape.",
