  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is urging global action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of countries lack sufficient capacity, particularly in developing nations. The WMO highlights that over 2 million people have died due to weather and climate-related disasters in the past 50 years, with 90% of deaths occurring in vulnerable regions. While progress has been made—such as a rise in multi-hazard systems from 52 to 108 countries—many still have only basic or insufficient systems, especially in conflict-affected or fragile states. Recent disasters in 2025, including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, underscore the urgent need for global monitoring. A real-world success story is the Swiss evacuation of Blatten in May 2025 due to predicted glacier collapse, demonstrating how early warning systems can save lives. The WMO stresses that early warnings lead to early action and aims to empower communities worldwide to respond proactively to climate change impacts.",
