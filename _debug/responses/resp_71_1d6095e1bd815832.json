  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition — to fund the WIC program, which supports nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms, and young children. This move was framed as a response to congressional inaction, with the White House claiming the shutdown forced the program to run out of money. While the administration argues this is a 'creative solution,' critics including budget experts and the National WIC Association raise concerns about legality, transparency, and long-term stability. WIC, a bipartisan-supported nutrition program, has seen rising enrollment due to inflation and improved access, but its future funding remains uncertain without congressional appropriation. The article highlights the tension between executive action and legislative authority, and underscores how political gridlock impacts essential public services.",
