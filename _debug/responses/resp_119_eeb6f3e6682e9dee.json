    "The term 'enshittification' describes how internet platforms evolve from user-friendly services into exploitative ones, following three stages: user acquisition, business customer enticement, and user and business degradation.",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber start by offering great value to users, then shift focus to business customers, eventually extracting more value from both users and businesses.",
    "Stage 3, where platforms 'turn to crap,' includes practices like algorithmic manipulation, predatory pricing, product cloning, and junk fees that hurt both users and merchants.",
    "Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, especially the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Proposed solutions include stronger antitrust enforcement, 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing users to take their data or content with them), and promoting interoperability between platforms to reduce monopolistic control."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces the concept of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms from user-friendly beginnings into exploitative, profit-driven systems — in his new book. He outlines three stages: initial user acquisition, business customer enticement, and final degradation where platforms exploit users and merchants through manipulated algorithms, predatory pricing, and hidden fees. Platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples, with Facebook allegedly shifting to ad-heavy feeds and Amazon accused of cloning products and charging junk fees that reduce merchant profits. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. He proposes solutions including stronger antitrust enforcement, right-to-exit regulations, and increased interoperability between platforms to restore user and business value.",
