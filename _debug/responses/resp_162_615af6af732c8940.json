  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The NZF, which would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax on shipping emissions, was originally approved in April 2025. Despite broad international support from nations including China, the EU, Brazil, and Britain, the vote shifted due to political pressure from the United States. Countries like Argentina and Singapore also changed their stance, voting to postpone implementation. The delay undermines global progress toward reducing shipping emissions, which contribute significantly to climate change, and raises concerns from climate advocates and the shipping industry about lack of clarity and investment risk. The decision marks a setback in international climate cooperation and highlights the influence of fossil fuel-aligned politics on global environmental policy.",
