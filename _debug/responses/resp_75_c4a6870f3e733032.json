  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him India would stop importing Russian oil, a statement India has strongly denied. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal and the foreign ministry have stated they are unaware of any such conversation or assurance, emphasizing that India’s energy policy focuses on stable prices and diversified sourcing. India remains a major buyer of Russian oil, with state-owned refiners like Indian Oil Corporation Limited continuing to purchase significant volumes. Analysts note that a sudden halt is impractical due to volume, quality, and refinery compatibility issues. The dispute has led to a 50% U.S. tariff on Indian imports, contributing to strained U.S.-India trade relations. Despite the friction, both countries are engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue, highlighting India’s strategic autonomy in global energy and foreign policy.",
