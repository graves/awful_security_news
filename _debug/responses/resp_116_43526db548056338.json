  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series after defeating the Seattle Mariners in a seven-game ALCS, marking their first appearance since 1993. The Blue Jays, who turned around from a last-place finish in 2024 to a 94-68 record and strong offensive performance, narrowly overcame the Mariners with a 4-3 series win, including a decisive Game 7 loss where the Mariners committed critical errors and allowed a late home run by George Springer. The Los Angeles Dodgers, with the largest payroll and a record of two World Series titles and five NL pennants over the past nine seasons, are the defending champions and face the Blue Jays in the World Series, starting on October 24. The Dodgers' postseason dominance — including a dominant 4-0 NLCS victory over the Brewers and a standout performance by Shohei Ohtani — makes them a formidable opponent. However, the Dodgers’ struggling bullpen presents a potential vulnerability that the Blue Jays could exploit. This matchup represents a pivotal moment in MLB postseason history, with the Blue Jays returning to the championship stage after over three decades and the Dodgers aiming for their first repeat title in 25 years.",
