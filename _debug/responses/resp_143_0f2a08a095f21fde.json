  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on a 100% tariff threat by Donald Trump against Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth metals. This action follows a history of reciprocal tariffs, starting from Trump’s 2018 policies and continuing under Biden with strict export controls on semiconductors and AI technologies. China justifies its rare earth restrictions as a national security measure, accusing the US of discriminatory trade practices and overreach. Experts interpret China’s measures as strategic 'pre-meeting choreography' to gain leverage ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea. Analysts note that while the US holds more strategic tools and global influence, China is better prepared and more strategic in its policy responses, with both sides maintaining escalation tools to project strength. The situation adds significant uncertainty to global trade, highlighting how economic policies are increasingly intertwined with national security and geopolitical competition.",
