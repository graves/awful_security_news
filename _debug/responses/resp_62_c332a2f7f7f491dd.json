  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, drones, and reconnaissance aircraft, including the reopening of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico. This buildup includes live-fire training, surveillance flights, and a show of force with B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast, raising concerns about a potential escalation. While the US does not have the force to invade Venezuela, experts believe the actions are primarily a strategic pressure campaign aimed at weakening President Nicolás Maduro, rather than a direct military incursion. The deployment is linked to President Donald Trump’s administration, which has signaled the possibility of Tomahawk missile strikes and other targeted actions, though the military presence is not sufficient for full occupation or control of the country.",
