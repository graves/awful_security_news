  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza has withstood its first major test after two Israeli soldiers were killed in the enclave, triggering airstrikes and accusations of violations from both Israel and Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched attacks across Gaza, accusing Hamas of attacking beyond the Yellow Line in Rafah, while Hamas denied involvement and said it remains committed to the ceasefire. The Al-Qassam Brigades reported finding and will return a captured Israeli hostage, while also warning that further Israeli escalation would hinder recovery efforts. Despite initial announcements to halt aid, Israel resumed deliveries, signaling a commitment to preserving key elements of the ceasefire, though the Rafah crossing remains closed. The situation is further strained by internal Hamas operations targeting alleged collaborators, including a public execution of eight people, and by domestic criticism from Israel’s far-right leadership, such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, who condemned aid resumption as a 'backdown'. The key architects of the agreement, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have arrived in the region to advance negotiations, while US officials continue to emphasize diplomatic engagement and implementation of the truce.",
