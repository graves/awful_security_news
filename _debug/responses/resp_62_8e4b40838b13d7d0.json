  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on the ongoing full government shutdown in the United States as of October 2025, resulting from Congress's failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. It contrasts this with the previous 35-day shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019—the longest in nearly 50 years—which cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected around 800,000 federal employees. The 2018 shutdown was partial, with some agencies operating under funding, while the current shutdown is full, affecting all federal operations. Political partisanship, a narrow Republican majority in the House under Speaker Mike Johnson, and the absence of 60 votes in the Senate to end a filibuster are key reasons negotiations have stalled. The article underscores the economic and operational costs of such shutdowns and highlights the ongoing struggle to pass critical funding legislation.",
