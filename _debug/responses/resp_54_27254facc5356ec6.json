  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Judge Michael Jesic resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 killings of their parents, making them eligible for parole after 35 years in prison. The brothers, who previously served life without parole, took full responsibility for the murders, citing years of childhood sexual abuse and self-defense. Family members, prison staff, and attorneys testified to their remorse and rehabilitation, including founding prison programs and supporting fellow inmates. However, current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes the resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of recidivism. The brothers are now seeking parole through the California state board and have filed a habeas petition with new evidence. Governor Gavin Newsom retains the power to commute the sentence or deny parole and has not yet acted. The decision marks a pivotal shift in how rehabilitation, trauma, and accountability are assessed in high-profile criminal cases.",
