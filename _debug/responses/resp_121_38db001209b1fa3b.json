  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage beginning at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time on October 20, 2025, which disrupted a wide range of online services, including social media, gaming, financial platforms, food delivery, streaming, and education platforms. The root cause was traced to a failure in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which prevents websites from loading by converting web addresses into IP addresses. The outage affected over 2,500 companies and led to widespread user complaints on platforms such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, Netflix, Disney+, Coinbase, and Signal. Educational institutions like the University of California, Riverside, Ohio State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte reported disruptions in student access to course materials and assignment submission. While AWS reported partial recovery by 6 a.m. and full restoration by 6 p.m. Eastern time, the recovery process was described as slow and bumpy, with engineers rolling out fixes that could cause smaller disruptions. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess emphasize that such outages are not uncommon and reflect a broader vulnerability: modern society relies heavily on a small number of tech companies for internet infrastructure, making the system fragile and prone to cascading failures. This event underscores the importance of redundancy, resilience, and transparency in cloud computing to protect critical services globally.",
