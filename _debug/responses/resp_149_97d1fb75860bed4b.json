  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s interim President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital, Lima, following weeks of violent protests led by Gen-Z activists over corruption and organized crime. The emergency, which allows military deployment and curtailment of civil liberties, follows the impeachment and removal of President Dina Boluarte on October 10, 2025, after Congress accused her of failing to address a surge in extortion and violence. Extortion cases have risen by 30% to 18,000 this year, with 1,690 homicides reported between January and September 2025—up from 1,502 in 2024. The move has sparked criticism, especially given that a previous emergency under Boluarte in March 2025 failed to reduce crime. On October 22, protests turned violent, resulting in one death and over 100 injuries, including police and journalists. Jeri has affirmed he will not resign, despite pressure to step down.",
