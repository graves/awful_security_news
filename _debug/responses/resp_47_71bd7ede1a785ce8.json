  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans seeking long-term mental health care through the VA are facing significant disruptions due to a new policy that limits one-on-one therapy sessions, especially after Doug Collins became VA secretary in 2021. Veterans like Michael, a combat veteran with PTSD, report being abruptly cut off from therapy, even when they need ongoing treatment. Providers say the policy is not clinically appropriate, as many mental health conditions, including PTSD, are chronic and require long-term care. Some providers have been disciplined or forced to justify session extensions in writing, leading to staff shortages and resignations. While the VA claims there are no session limits and that care is personalized, patients and clinicians argue that the policy undermines trust, recovery, and patient autonomy. The American Psychological Association is reviewing the issue, and veterans express fear that their mental health is being compromised by premature termination of care.",
