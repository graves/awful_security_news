    "The mysterious diffuse glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, remains unexplained, with two leading theories: pulsars and dark matter collisions.",
    "Dark matter, an invisible form of matter believed to be five times more abundant than ordinary matter, has long been theorized by astronomers like Fritz Zwicky (1930s) and confirmed by Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford (1970s) through stellar motion observations.",
    "Recent supercomputer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter in the galactic center could be squashed into an egg-shaped structure, matching the observed bulge-like shape of the gamma-ray glow, supporting the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "The study suggests a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, compared to older stars (pulsars), though independent scientists remain cautious and note the match is not definitive.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate from 2027 in Chile and Spain, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively determine whether the glow stems from dark matter or pulsars.",
    "WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) remain a leading dark matter candidate, and their annihilation could produce gamma rays — a key mechanism being tested through space-based observations.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter on Earth, the Fermi data and new simulations keep the WIMP hypothesis viable and highlight dark matter as one of the most profound unresolved problems in physics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are reevaluating the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008. While pulsars (rotating remnants of dead stars) have long been a leading explanation, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter—specifically, collisions between dark matter particles—could produce a bulge-shaped glow that matches the observed data. This suggests a 50% chance that the glow stems from dark matter, rather than old stars. The study challenges the long-held assumption that dark matter is uniformly spherical, demonstrating instead a squashed, egg-shaped distribution consistent with Fermi data. Though not definitive, the findings support the dark matter hypothesis and highlight the potential of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to start operations in 2027, to provide conclusive evidence. If confirmed, this would represent a major breakthrough in solving one of the greatest mysteries in physics—the nature of dark matter, which makes up most of the universe but has never been directly observed.",
