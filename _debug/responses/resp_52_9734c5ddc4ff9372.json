  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for a ceasefire, contradicting earlier claims that Ukraine could recover all lost land. Trump, who later advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, raised his voice and dismissed Ukraine’s request for long-range missiles capable of reaching Russia, citing concerns over escalating the conflict. Zelensky described the meeting as tense but constructive, expressing pessimism about Trump’s demands and noting the importance of maintaining current frontlines. The meeting occurred amid growing diplomatic tension and a shift in Trump’s approach, influenced by his recent peace efforts in Gaza. Putin had previously proposed a territorial swap involving Donbas in exchange for Russian-held areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, a plan that would still represent a significant loss for Ukraine. Trump denied asking for the full surrender of Donbas, stating that 78% of Ukraine’s land is already occupied and that the war should end at current battle lines. The episode reflects broader tensions in U.S.-Ukraine relations and underscores the difficulty of achieving a sustainable peace in the ongoing war.",
