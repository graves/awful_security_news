    "The Tomahawk cruise missile is a proven, effective, and relatively affordable weapon used in multiple conflicts including Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen.",
    "Tomahawks have a range of 1,600 to 2,500 kilometers and are capable of carrying high-explosive payloads with advanced guidance and low-altitude flight characteristics, making them hard to intercept.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested Tomahawk missiles to strike deep inside Russia, specifically targeting critical infrastructure like the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast.",
    "Despite its military potential, the U.S. has limited Tomahawk missiles available and stated that they are needed for American defense and operations, citing that few are left for export or Ukraine.",
    "Ukraine lacks a ground-launched system (such as the Typhon) to fire Tomahawks, which are primarily sea-launched, making deployment impractical without significant infrastructure development.",
    "Ukraine has developed a domestic cruise missile called the Flamingo, which is said to have a similar range to the Tomahawk, but its capabilities remain unclear and production is limited due to lack of resources.",
    "The Kremlin has issued strong warnings about the potential escalation of the war if Ukraine receives Tomahawks, interpreting them as a nuclear-capable threat due to their potential to carry nuclear warheads.",
    "Ukraine’s military strategy is currently more dependent on air defense systems than long-range offensive capabilities due to increasing Russian missile and drone attacks.",
    "Zelensky has pursued a $90 billion weapons deal with U.S. manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to enhance Ukraine’s defense and offense capabilities."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective U.S. weapon used in multiple global conflicts, has been the subject of renewed interest from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who seeks its delivery to strike deep inside Russia, including key sites like the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base. Despite its high explosive power, precision guidance, and long range, the U.S. Trump administration has denied Ukraine access, stating they have few missiles left and need them for American defense. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch system (the Typhon) to deploy Tomahawks, and its own Flamingo missile remains unproven and underdeveloped. Russia views the potential supply of Tomahawks as a nuclear threat and has warned of escalation, with Putin directly discussing the issue in a call with Trump. While Tomahawks could significantly damage Russian infrastructure, Ukraine’s immediate needs remain focused on air defense due to overwhelming drone and missile attacks. Zelensky is pursuing a $90 billion weapons deal with U.S. firms like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to bolster Ukraine’s overall defense capabilities.",
