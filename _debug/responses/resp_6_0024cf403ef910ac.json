  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS experienced a network connection outage on October 21, 2025, preventing some of its pharmacies from filling prescriptions and delivering medications, prompting customer frustration and a public apology. The company confirmed the issue was a known system failure and stated that service had been restored. The incident coincided with a major outage at Amazon Web Services, underscoring the growing vulnerability of daily services—especially in healthcare and public infrastructure—when they depend on cloud-based digital systems. While CVS's acquisition of 60 Rite Aid locations reflects strategic market expansion, it is not directly tied to the technical failure. This event highlights the critical need for reliable, resilient digital infrastructure in essential services like medication access and public health.",
