  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hamas has returned the remains of two more Israeli captives, bringing the total to 12 of 28 deceased captives since the ceasefire deal was signed, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. While Hamas claims recovery is hindered by destruction and lack of resources, Israel accuses Hamas of failing to meet the 72-hour deadline for returning all bodies. The ceasefire agreement required Hamas to return all deceased captives in exchange for the release of Palestinian bodies and prisoners. As of now, the Rafah border crossing is set to reopen on October 20, but Israel has withheld it until all bodies are returned. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid—such as food and shelter provided by UNRWA—remains blocked, with supplies stuck in Jordan and Egypt, exacerbating the ongoing crisis. Both sides are accusing each other of ceasefire violations, with the situation highlighting a deepening humanitarian and political impasse.",
