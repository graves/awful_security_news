  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food deliveries to Gaza have increased following a US-brokered ceasefire but remain far below the target of 2,000 tonnes, with only 750 tonnes entering daily through two Israeli-controlled crossings — Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite expanding to 26 distribution points, the WFP still falls short of its goal of 145 points across Gaza. The Rafah crossing remains closed, and access to northern Gaza is severely restricted due to blocked routes like Salah al-Din Street and lack of permissions. Hamas has handed over 13 of 28 Israeli captives’ bodies, with two more delivered as of the article’s date. The WFP warns that current supplies are only sufficient for half a million people for two weeks, and many Palestinians are storing food out of fear of future supply disruptions. The article underscores the fragility of the ceasefire and the urgent need to open more crossings to prevent famine, especially in the northern regions of Gaza.",
