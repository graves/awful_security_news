Hamas has handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 missing Israeli hostages, with one identified as Eliyahu Margalit, a 76-year-old from Nir Oz. Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has maintained control over the Rafah crossing, keeping it closed since May 2024, citing delays in remain handovers. The U.S. has expressed concern, warning that a planned Hamas attack on civilians would violate the ceasefire and lead to escalated action. Gaza’s Health Ministry reports over 68,000 Palestinian deaths, with thousands still missing, and humanitarian aid remains severely restricted due to border closures. Families across Israel continue to rally in Tel Aviv, demanding the return of all deceased relatives. Hamas accuses Israel of continuing attacks and violations of the ceasefire, while both sides face challenges related to unexploded ordnance, transparency, and trust in casualty counts.",
