  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Warner Bros. Discovery, parent company of CNN and HBO Max, is considering a sale after receiving 'multiple' expressions of interest from potential buyers such as Paramount, Comcast, and possibly Netflix. The company has initiated a review of strategic alternatives, including a full sale, a split into Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, or a hybrid structure. Paramount has shown interest in acquiring the entire company, though its initial offer was deemed a 'lowball' by WBD’s board. CEO David Zaslav continues to promote a planned split to unlock greater market value, but the announcement suggests that other outcomes may now be more likely. Market reaction is positive, with WBD shares rising over 11% in response to the news. Analysts believe the strategic review will take weeks or months, with due diligence underway and no firm timeline for decisions.",
