  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Poland has arrested eight individuals, including three Ukrainian nationals, on suspicion of espionage, sabotage, and planning to send explosive packages to Ukraine via cross-border networks. The arrests come amid broader accusations that Russia is conducting a hybrid warfare campaign involving espionage, sabotage, and drone incursions across Europe. Authorities in Poland, Romania, and other countries have uncovered coordinated operations, with evidence of explosive packages delivered through international delivery services and intelligence sharing between operatives. These actions are part of a larger pattern observed since 2022, with similar cases in Lithuania, Latvia, and the UK. The European Union has responded with proposals for a 'drone wall' to counter rising drone threats, while Poland has pledged to upgrade its air defences. The situation underscores growing concerns about hybrid warfare as a tool of geopolitical destabilization.",
