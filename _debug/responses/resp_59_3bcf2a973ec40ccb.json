  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, citing concerns about public safety and historical precedent. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Pakistan, who was charged with violating the law after marijuana and cocaine were found at his home. The Trump administration argued that habitual drug users pose a danger to society, especially when impaired and interacting with law enforcement, and that Hemani’s travel to Iran and phone activity linked to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps affiliates support this claim. However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled the law cannot target habitual users, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision that requires such prohibitions to have historical roots. Hemani’s legal team challenged the historical justification, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized marijuana, and that gun ownership among marijuana users is significant. The case also includes the precedent of Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, who was convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding political and public controversy. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025, with arguments scheduled for next year.",
