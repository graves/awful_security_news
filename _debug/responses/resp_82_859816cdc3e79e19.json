    "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing pressure from his boss John Catsimatidis to drop out of the race.",
    "John Catsimatidis, a supermarket magnate and longtime New Yorker, publicly urged Sliwa to step down, claiming Sliwa should 'love New York more than anything else' and asserting that Sliwa's support is not aligned with the city's best interests.",
    "Sliwa has dismissed criticism from Andrew Cuomo and his allies, arguing that billionaire donors and political figures like Bill Ackman are using influence to dominate the race, and that he represents blue-collar working-class voters.",
    "Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is attempting to unify Republican support against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani by positioning himself as a moderate alternative, while dismissing Sliwa as an ineffective and unviable candidate.",
    "Sliwa and Mamdani are seen by some as unlikely allies, with concerns that their campaigns may be coordinating, though Mamdani denies such coordination and insists on allowing voters to make their own choices.",
    "President Donald Trump has shown little enthusiasm for Sliwa, mocking his cat-obsessed persona and calling him 'not exactly primetime,' signaling broader Republican division over the mayoral race.",
    "Sliwa, known for founding the Guardian Angels, is a perennial candidate with no prior political office, polling third behind Mamdani and Cuomo in the current race.",
    "The political landscape reflects a growing tension between grassroots, working-class voices and elite financial donors in New York City politics."
