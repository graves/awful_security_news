  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The week-long announcement schedule includes physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics prizes, each awarded by dedicated institutions. The article highlights the scientific significance of past laureates such as Victor Ambros, Gary Ruvkun, John Hopfield, Geoffrey Hinton, David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper, whose work has revolutionized biology, AI, and medicine. The literature prize went to Han Kang for her powerful exploration of trauma and identity, while the peace prize in 2024 was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo for nuclear disarmament advocacy. The 2025 peace prize faces intense scrutiny due to public claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he deserves the award, though experts argue that the Norwegian Nobel Committee values sustained peace efforts over political self-promotion. Concerns have also been raised about political interference in scientific institutions, such as the Trump administration's impact on academic freedom. The Nobel Prizes remain central to global recognition of scientific, literary, and humanitarian achievements, with all awards formally presented in December and celebrated worldwide.",
