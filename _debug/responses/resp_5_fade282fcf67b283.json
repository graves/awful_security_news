  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man from Kibbutz Nir Oz, has been identified as the tenth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement. This recovery marks a small step in the difficult process of returning all missing hostages, but frustration in Israel persists due to Hamas’s inability to locate and deliver all remains. Israeli intelligence suspects Hamas is withholding some bodies as leverage, while Hamas claims it has handed over all accessible remains. The ceasefire remains fragile, strained by continued Israeli military operations, including the killing of 11 civilians in Gaza who crossed a ceasefire line, and by limited humanitarian access—especially at the closed Rafah crossing. Meanwhile, negotiations in Egypt on Phase Two of the ceasefire are underway, focusing on Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and a proposed International Stabilization Force (ISF), including a technocratic Palestinian government and a U.S.-led Board of Peace. Despite these plans, Hamas remains vague on disarmament and transfer of power, and international participation in the ISF is still being negotiated, with some countries demanding UN approval.",
