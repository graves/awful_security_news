  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing unusual animal behavior, hearing roaring sounds, or using gunfire and fires as warning signals—is proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems in preventing loss of life during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite significant investment, including a $37 million GLOF-II project, many systems remain non-operational, and communities lack trust in the technology due to frequent failures and lack of follow-up. In contrast, local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have repeatedly saved lives by using time-tested, community-based warning methods. The article underscores a broader global challenge: even with technological infrastructure, early warning systems fail without community trust, local engagement, and cultural relevance. As climate change accelerates glacier melt and flood risks, Pakistan’s reliance on Indigenous knowledge highlights both a resilience strategy and a systemic gap in climate adaptation policy.",
