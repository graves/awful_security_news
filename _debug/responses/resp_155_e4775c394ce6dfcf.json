  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Palestine solidarity activist, was detained in March 2025 after activism at Columbia University, and later released in June 2025 by a federal district court in New Jersey on a habeas corpus petition. The Trump administration is attempting to deport him, citing foreign policy concerns, claiming he concealed work with UNRWA on immigration forms. Legal experts and the ACLU argue that such deportation efforts are unconstitutional, as they weaponize vague immigration laws to silence political speech. Khalil’s case, along with broader rulings, highlights a national conflict over whether political activism related to Palestine can be legally punished. The case is now being appealed through the Board of Immigration Appeals and may go to a circuit court on constitutional grounds. A separate federal judge recently ruled that the Trump administration’s crackdown on such activists violates free speech rights, reinforcing the significance of Khalil’s case as a test of free expression in the United States.",
