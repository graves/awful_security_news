  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough with significant implications for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full awards cycle spans from October 6 to October 13, with each prize announced by its respective institution. This year, the science prizes reflect major advances in medicine, physics, and chemistry—particularly in AI-driven protein prediction and neural networks—while the literature and peace prizes highlight artistic and ethical dimensions of human experience. The peace prize controversy has centered on U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of deserving recognition for ending wars, though experts emphasize the prize's focus on lasting peace and institutional action. Concerns about political interference in science, especially under the Trump administration, have been raised by officials such as Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, underscoring the importance of academic freedom in democratic societies.",
