Petro has responded with strong rebuttals, calling Trump 'rude and ignorant', and previously faced visa revocation over comments on US military actions and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Citizens across Colombia express fear of economic hardship, job losses, and restricted family travel, highlighting the human cost of the political conflict. The situation underscores the vulnerability of a nation facing global geopolitical tensions, especially when economic and security aid are at stake.",
