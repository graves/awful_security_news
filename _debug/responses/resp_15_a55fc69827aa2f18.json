  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities taking starkly opposing positions. Pro-Palestinian advocates, such as Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, continue to call for accountability and humanitarian aid, while pro-Israel figures like Debra Messing accuse them of silence and anti-Jewish bias. A significant boycott of Israeli film institutions has been organized by groups like Film Workers for Palestine, supported by nearly 4,000 celebrities, but has drawn criticism from pro-Israel artists and studios including Paramount and Warner Bros., who argue it promotes censorship. The issue is further complicated by reports of Hamas-led executions in Gaza, which have prompted concern about the ceasefire’s sustainability. The conflict has led to public and private rifts, with stars facing consequences like being dropped from agencies or franchises, and studios now facing internal and external pressure over political alignment. The article underscores how the entertainment industry has become a battleground of political opinion, even as the world watches the fragile peace in the Middle East.",
