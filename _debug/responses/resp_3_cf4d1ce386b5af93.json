  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where over a foot of rain could cause dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While the likelihood of direct impact on the U.S. mainland is low, rough surf and rip currents are possible along the East Coast, with Florida being a potential secondary impact zone. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean Sea, fueled by unusually warm sea temperatures. This warmth has contributed to a trend of rapid intensification seen in recent storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Two main track scenarios are being monitored: one with Melissa turning north toward Hispaniola and becoming a Category 1 hurricane, and another with it moving westward toward Central America. The storm's exact path remains uncertain, but its potential for severe weather across the Caribbean highlights growing risks due to climate change and warming oceans.",
