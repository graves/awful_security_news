This theory has inspired violent attacks in places like Norway, Christchurch, El Paso, and Buffalo. In Europe, countries like Italy, under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, have implemented aggressive remigration policies, deporting asylum seekers to countries like Albania, often bypassing international agreements and human rights standards. Experts argue that the term is deliberately vague and serves as a 'dog whistle' for extremist ideologies, allowing far-right groups to promote ethnic homogeneity under the guise of policy reform. The use of 'remigrate' in official messaging risks normalizing racist, dehumanizing practices and may legitimize or empower violent ideologies.",
