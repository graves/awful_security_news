  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 9, 2025, oversight visit to an ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. The incident involved McIver and other Democratic lawmakers attempting to inspect the facility, which was obstructed by ICE officials, and when Mayor Ras Baraka was removed and later arrested for trespassing. Prosecutors claim McIver physically resisted officers, while her defense argues her actions were protected under the Speech or Debate Clause and that the prosecution is politically motivated, especially in contrast to President Donald Trump's pardons of January 6 rioters. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that the incident involved Antifa activity are prejudicial and ordered their removal. The case has drawn strong political and public support from fellow Democrats and criticism from the administration, making it a focal point in the broader political battle over immigration policy and political accountability.",
