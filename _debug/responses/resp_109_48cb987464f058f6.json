    "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify their nest architecture to reduce disease spread when threatened by the fungus Metarhizium brunneum.",
    "The ants increase nest compartmentalization, reduce interconnectivity, and space nest entrances farther apart to limit pathogen transmission.",
    "These structural changes work in tandem with social behaviors like self-isolation of infected ants and increased distance between nurses and foragers.",
    "This behavior demonstrates a form of 'social immunity' — a collective defense strategy beyond individual immune responses.",
    "The study suggests that principles from ant colony architecture could inspire human-designed public spaces to reduce disease transmission.",
    "The research is published in the journal Science and is considered a first demonstration of non-human social species actively modifying their environment to combat epidemics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to the threat of the deadly fungus Metarhizium brunneum by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase their distance from foragers, forming a form of proactive social distancing. Further, ants modify their nests to become more compartmentalized, with reduced tunnel interconnectivity, farther-spaced entrances, and longer travel routes, which slows disease spread. This dual social and architectural response demonstrates a collective form of 'social immunity' and offers a novel inspiration for human architectural design aimed at reducing disease transmission in public spaces, such as hospitals or crowded urban areas.",
