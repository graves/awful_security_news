  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and announced a halt to all U.S. aid and subsidies to Colombia. This comes amid claims by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that a vessel linked to the National Liberation Army was attacked in the Caribbean, resulting in three deaths. Colombia strongly rejected the accusations, with Petro denouncing the U.S. for assassinating a civilian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, in a September 16 strike, asserting the boat was adrift and not involved in drug trafficking. Petro accused the U.S. of violating Colombian sovereignty and committing murder, demanding international legal action. The U.S. has conducted multiple strikes in the region since early September, killing at least 29 people, sparking outrage from human rights groups like Amnesty International, which called the actions murder on the high seas. The crisis deepens amid existing tensions, including the revocation of Petro’s U.S. visa after he criticized U.S. military orders in a pro-Palestinian demonstration.",
