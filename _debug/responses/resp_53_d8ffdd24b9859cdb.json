    "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has recommended that a judge resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted in 1996 of murdering their parents in 1989.",
    "The recommendation follows a 2023 habeas corpus petition citing new evidence of physical and sexual abuse by their father, which the defense argues may have influenced the brothers' actions.",
    "Under California law, the brothers would be eligible for life with the possibility of parole due to being under 26 at the time of the crimes, and Gascón believes they have paid their debt to society.",
    "The brothers have been described as model prisoners and have contributed to rehabilitation efforts, including programs for trauma and inmate support.",
    "The decision has drawn public attention, especially after the Netflix series 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story' and related documentaries increased awareness of the case.",
    "Gascón emphasized that modern understanding of sexual abuse and judicial standards has changed significantly since 1996, and that the case reflects evolving standards of justice.",
    "The decision has been supported by figures such as Kim Kardashian and criticized by some as politically motivated, though Gascón maintains it is rooted in justice and fairness.",
    "The brothers' attorneys hope the resentencing will allow them to be eligible for parole and live outside prison, citing their rehabilitation and the role of abuse in their actions.",
    "A hearing on the resentencing is expected within 30 to 45 days, though no date has been finalized."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a significant development nearly 30 years after their 1996 conviction for murdering their parents, Lyle and Erik Menendez are being considered for resentencing by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón. The decision follows a 2023 habeas corpus petition that cited new evidence, including a sworn statement by Roy Rosselló and a letter from Erik Menendez, alleging long-term sexual and physical abuse by their father. Gascón argues that the brothers have rehabilitated, have contributed positively to prison life, and that modern understanding of abuse has changed, leading to a reevaluation of their case under California’s resentencing laws. The brothers would be eligible for life with the possibility of parole due to being under 26 at the time of the crimes. A hearing is expected within 30 to 45 days, though no date has been set. The decision has drawn public attention, especially due to the Netflix series and documentary, and has been supported by figures like Kim Kardashian and Anamaria Baralt, who view it as a step toward justice and truth.",
