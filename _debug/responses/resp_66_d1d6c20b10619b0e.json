  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have reached a new immediate ceasefire after over a week of deadly border clashes, following mediation by Qatar and Turkey. The fighting, which began on October 10, 2025, stemmed from mutual accusations: Pakistan accused Afghanistan of harboring the TTP (Pakistani Taliban), while Afghanistan accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes on civilian areas, including in Paktika province. A civilian attack killed eight people, including three cricket players, prompting the Afghanistan Cricket Board to withdraw from a scheduled T20I tournament. Both sides agreed to halt attacks on civilians, security forces, and critical infrastructure. Pakistan denied targeting civilians, stating its actions were directed only at verified militant camps. The conflict, one of the deadliest since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, raises concerns about regional stability, with at least 30 civilians killed and hundreds injured in Afghanistan according to UNAMA. The ceasefire, while temporary, represents a fragile step toward lasting peace between two historically allied neighbors now facing deepening tensions.",
