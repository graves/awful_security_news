  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey, following weeks of escalating violence along their disputed 2,611-kilometer border. The agreement, which came into effect on October 19, 2025, includes a mutual pledge not to engage in hostile actions, support militants, or target civilians or infrastructure. Both countries committed to respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul. Key border crossings such as Chaman and Torkham remain closed, severely disrupting trade, refugee movements, and local economies. The truce is seen as a temporary relief, with ongoing concerns about implementation and the long-term resolution of territorial and security disputes, especially given Afghanistan's refusal to recognize the Durand Line and Pakistan's claims of cross-border terrorism since 2021.",
