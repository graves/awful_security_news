    "The majority of Guatemalan textile factories (over 850) do not allow workers’ unions; only 9% (76 factories) permit union activity, and union leaders have faced threats, violence, and even assassination.",
    "Workers are often unaware of the brands they produce for, and have no legal recourse when laid off, as suppliers like Target are not directly responsible for labor conditions.",
    "A culture of fear prevails, with reports of verbal abuse, sexual harassment, and physical threats, especially from managers, and workers are punished for speaking up or organizing.",
    "Government agencies like the Ministry of Labor are unable to effectively inspect or intervene due to management obstruction and lack of cooperation, showing systemic failure in labor oversight.",
    "Despite a 6% increase in the minimum wage under President Arévalo, enforcement remains weak, and workers face financial devastation when jobs are lost, such as when Rutilia Cano lost her pension after her factory closed.",
    "The future of workers is uncertain due to potential US import tariffs affecting supply chains, and growing awareness of a 'gendered supply chain shock' affecting women-dominated industries globally."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the harsh realities of labor exploitation in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas. Despite contributing to nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP and serving as a key hub for US apparel brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, the factories operate under severe conditions: workers, mostly women, face long hours (up to 15 hours a day), daily quotas, wage theft, and threats of violence. Korean-owned companies dominate the sector, controlling two-thirds of investments, while US brands benefit from subcontracting but lack legal responsibility for worker welfare. Union activity is stifled by threats, violence, and management obstruction—such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal and the intimidation of union representatives like Corina Olivares. Workers face sexual harassment and psychological distress, and many are laid off with no severance or pension, as seen in Rutilia Cano’s case. Even when labor inspections are attempted, factory owners block access, showing institutional failure. While President Bernardo Arévalo has raised the minimum wage and pledged reform, enforcement remains weak. The article underscores a global 'gendered supply chain shock' where women are disproportionately affected, and workers like Alexandra are choosing to exit the industry to protect future generations from such exploitation.",
