  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican mayoral candidate in New York City, is facing mounting pressure to withdraw from the race, including direct intervention from his boss John Catsimatidis, who urges him to step down in favor of a unified Republican opposition to the Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is actively working to consolidate Republican support and discredit Sliwa as a viable alternative, calling him a 'shock jock' and claiming he's not a real alternative. Sliwa, known for founding the Guardian Angels and his grassroots appeal, has rejected the pressure, arguing that billionaire donors should not dictate city politics and that he represents working-class New Yorkers. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has dismissed Sliwa, mocking his cat-related image and political style, while Mamdani and Sliwa are seen as unexpected allies, with both asserting that New Yorkers should decide who governs, not donors or political elites.",
