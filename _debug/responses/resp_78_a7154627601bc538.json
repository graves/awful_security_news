  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans receiving mental health care through the VA are reporting that long-term one-on-one therapy sessions are being abruptly ended due to a policy implemented under the Trump administration and enforced by VA Secretary Doug Collins. Despite evidence that conditions like PTSD require lifelong care, providers are now pressured to terminate sessions at fixed limits—often between four and 24—without patient or provider input. This has led to staff resignations, re-traumatization of patients, and a loss of trust in care. While the VA denies that such limits exist, citing shared decision-making, providers and veterans say the policy is clinically inappropriate and harmful. Experts, including the American Psychological Association, are now examining the issue, calling for individualized, recovery-focused treatment that respects the chronic nature of many veteran mental health conditions.",
