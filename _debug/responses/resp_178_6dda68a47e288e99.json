  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has voluntarily given up all remaining royal titles — including Duke of York, Knight of the Garter, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh — in response to a cascade of scandals, particularly concerning his alleged continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein. This decision follows the public release of an email showing Andrew maintained contact with Epstein longer than he claimed, contradicting his previous statements. The move was seen as a way to avoid formal parliamentary action and to protect the royal family’s reputation, especially during a high-profile international event such as the King and Queen’s visit to the Vatican. The controversy was further fueled by Virginia Giuffre’s upcoming memoir, which accuses Andrew of being 'entitled' and of toxic ties to Epstein, and by private emails contradicting Sarah Ferguson’s public claims. The decision marks a symbolic and public retreat from royal life, with Andrew no longer attending key royal events such as the Christmas gathering or the Order of the Garter parade. Although he denies wrongdoing, the cumulative evidence and public pressure have led to a significant shift in public and political perception, with US lawmakers like Robert Garcia calling the step 'long overdue' and part of a broader effort for justice.",
