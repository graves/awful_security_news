  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies by over 80%, new research shows a significant decline in allergy rates in the U.S. The rate of peanut allergies in children aged 0 to 3 dropped by over 27% after 2015 and by over 40% after 2017 due to updated medical guidelines. Dr. David Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from pediatric practices and found that around 40,000 children avoided peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial resistance and slow adoption among healthcare providers—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the 2017 guidance—the practice is now being widely implemented and appears to be having measurable public health benefits. Experts like Dr. David Hill and FARE advocate for introducing allergenic foods like peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products between four and six months of age in small, safe amounts. This shift reflects a broader movement toward evidence-based infant nutrition to reduce the incidence of life-threatening food allergies.",
