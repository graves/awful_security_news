  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean allegedly carrying fentanyl and other drugs, two survivors — an Ecuadorian man, Andrés Fernando Tufiño, and a Colombian citizen — were repatriated. Tufiño was released by Ecuadorian authorities due to a lack of evidence linking him to drug trafficking, while the Colombian survivor remains hospitalized and will face prosecution under national law. The attacks have intensified diplomatic tensions between the United States and key Latin American allies, especially Colombia and Ecuador. Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of killing a citizen in a prior strike, prompting the recall of Colombia’s ambassador. Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa defended regional cooperation against drug trafficking, while U.S. President Donald Trump justified the strikes as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, drawing comparisons to the George W. Bush administration’s post-9/11 war on terrorism. There is little evidence that fentanyl is produced in the Andes, suggesting the attacks may target smuggling routes rather than production hubs. With at least seven such strikes reported since September 2025 and over 32 deaths, the situation has raised serious concerns about regional stability, sovereignty, and the legality of military intervention.",
