  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank, including banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) from operating and de-registering major non-governmental organizations (INGOs) based on ideological grounds such as alleged support for terrorism or incitement of racism. These actions, carried out under a new registration process overseen by COGAT, have left critical aid groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps unable to deliver supplies or staff. Despite a ceasefire brokered by President Trump that promised increased aid, Israel continues to block most border crossings, allowing only two out of seven. Humanitarian officials report that hundreds of aid trucks have been stranded for months, and UNRWA's warehouses in Egypt and Jordan contain enough supplies to feed Gaza for three months. The U.S. cut funding to UNRWA last year, exacerbating the financial crisis, while Israel claims security justifications for its actionsâ€”claims not supported by evidence. The situation raises urgent global concerns over the humanitarian impact of politicized aid policies and the potential for systematic denial of basic rights to civilians in occupied territories.",
