  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russian forces are advancing across several fronts in Ukraine, including Kupiansk and Vovchansk, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and drones—over 3,270 drones and 1,370 guided bombs in a week—targeting Ukrainian military and infrastructure. Despite US President Donald Trump’s call for a combat freeze, Russia continues its offensive, leveraging improved drone and missile tactics, greater battlefield autonomy, and new armored systems. Ukrainian forces, led by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, argue that Russia lacks strategic initiative and has achieved only minor advances. The conflict has caused massive Russian casualties—up to 250,000 killed and over 950,000 wounded—spurring Russia to reconsider recruitment strategies, such as reducing financial bonuses and potentially mobilizing reserves. Ukraine responds with long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting up to one-fifth of refining capacity, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate or end hostilities. The war remains ongoing, with no sign of a ceasefire after over 1,300 days of conflict.",
