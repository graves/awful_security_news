  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator and political outsider, won Bolivia’s presidential election with 54.5% of the vote, defeating former right-wing President Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga in a runoff that followed a historic defeat of the long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. The victory marks the end of nearly two decades of MAS governance and signals a major political transformation amid Bolivia’s worst economic crisis in decades. Voters, especially in rural and working-class areas, were disillusioned by inflation, fuel shortages, and high living costs. Paz’s campaign, led by his charismatic running mate Edman Lara, appealed to a desire for change, promising to end the fixed exchange rate, reduce fuel subsidies, and shift toward free-market reforms. However, his economic plans face skepticism due to their vagueness and potential to destabilize the economy. Despite this, Paz’s victory is significant because it marks Bolivia’s first shift to a non-MAS government in 20 years and represents a renewed effort to rebuild relations with the United States. The new president will take office on November 8, facing immense challenges in stabilizing the economy, restoring foreign currency reserves, and gaining public trust.",
