  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American culture, driven by political rhetoric, popular media, and commercial branding. It highlights how the cowboy has become a symbol of traditional, conservative American values, particularly among political figures like Donald Trump and in media such as 'Yellowstone' and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour. However, the article critiques this image as a romanticized myth that obscures the historical reality of cowboys being primarily Mexican, Native, or Black Americans. It notes that while media and fashion have amplified the cowboy aesthetic, real working conditions, economic struggles, and racial diversity in cowboy culture are often omitted. The piece underscores a broader cultural trend: the cyclical revival of cowboy myths, rooted in entertainment and political ideology, and the recent, albeit imperfect, efforts to include Black cowboys in the narrative. This resurgence reflects both a cultural nostalgia and a political strategy, showing how identity, tradition, and patriotism are constructed and reimagined over time.",
