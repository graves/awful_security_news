  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was convicted in 2023 of fraud and identity theft charges, including falsely claiming a business background and wealth. Santos, expelled from Congress after colleagues uncovered fabricated life details, was released from FCI Fairton, New Jersey, on October 17, 2025. Trump justified the commutation by comparing Santos' deception to that of Senator Richard Blumenthal’s false military service claims, arguing the severity is comparable. The move draws both praise and criticism within the Republican Party, with figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene supporting it as a matter of justice and Nick LaLota opposing it as a failure to uphold accountability. The commutation also clears Santos of all fines, restitution, and probation, and is part of a broader pattern of Trump’s executive clemency actions targeting former Republican politicians since taking office in January 2025.",
