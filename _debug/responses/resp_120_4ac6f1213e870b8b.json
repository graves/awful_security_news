  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, which began at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and lasted until approximately 6 p.m. Eastern time. The root cause was identified as a failure in AWS's domain name system (DNS) in the US-EAST-1 region, leading to widespread disruptions across services including social media (Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and education tools (Canvas). Users of Amazon's own products like Ring and Alexa also reported outages. The incident highlighted the extreme fragility of modern internet infrastructure, as society has become heavily reliant on just a few tech giants like Amazon, whose infrastructure underpins critical services. Experts such as Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages are typically non-cyberattack-related, resolve within hours, and follow established recovery processes. This is not the first time AWS has experienced such outages—previous incidents in 2017, 2020, and 2021 have demonstrated recurring vulnerabilities. The event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized control of essential digital services.",
