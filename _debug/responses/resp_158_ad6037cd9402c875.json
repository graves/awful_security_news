    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, in addition to seven previously restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw rare-earth metals and specialized technological equipment used in refining the metals, with exports requiring special approvals from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.",
    "The new controls are justified under national security grounds, citing concerns about foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for defense technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, submarine systems, missiles, and radar, as well as civilian applications including electric vehicles, AI semiconductors, and LED displays.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, sourcing about 70% of its rare-earth compounds between 2020 and 2023, making it particularly vulnerable to these restrictions.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "Analysts interpret the move as strategic leverage ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling China’s willingness to weaponize its supply chain dominance.",
    "The restrictions are seen as a response to previous US tariffs and part of broader trade tensions, with China using export controls to strengthen its negotiating position.",
    "Exemptions exist for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, and disaster relief, indicating a balance between security and humanitarian considerations.",
    "The move underscores the deep interdependence of US and Chinese economies, even as they pursue strategic decoupling in key technologies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced stricter export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions, effective from December 1, 2025. The move, made just before a high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, is viewed as a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing US-China trade negotiations. Rare-earth metals are essential for advanced defense systems such as F-35 fighter jets, submarines, and precision-guided weapons, as well as civilian technologies like electric vehicles and semiconductors. The US is the largest importer of these metals, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China, making it particularly vulnerable. Analysts interpret the restrictions as a signaling tactic to pressure Washington, emphasizing China’s dominance in the global rare-earth supply chain. While exemptions exist for emergency medical and disaster relief uses, the move underscores the deep interdependence and strategic competition between the two nations in critical supply chains.",
