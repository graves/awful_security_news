  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, cloud formations, and loud sounds like glacier bursts—is being used effectively by local shepherds to detect and warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite government investment in technological early warning systems (EWS), such as sensors and sirens, these systems have failed to gain community trust due to malfunctions, lack of real-time integration, and poor engagement with local populations. A $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017 has not led to operational success, with reports of non-functioning equipment and no official follow-up. In contrast, stories from shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain demonstrate that traditional human-based signals—such as gunfire or fire alarms—have successfully saved lives. Pakistan, a top 10 climate-vulnerable nation with a 1.3°C temperature rise since the 1950s, faces increasing GLOF frequency due to glacial melt, and the article underscores the urgent need for integrating traditional Indigenous knowledge with modern systems to build climate resilience.",
