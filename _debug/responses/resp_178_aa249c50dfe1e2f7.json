  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daring daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris saw four masked thieves steal high-value jewellery, including a necklace from Napoleon I and a tiara from Empress Eugenie, estimated at €88 million. The thieves used a modified truck and power tools to gain entry, bypassing security systems, and escaped on scooters. Investigations reveal serious lapses in museum security, such as missing CCTV in one-third of rooms and a non-triggering alarm system. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, condemned the attack as a breach of national heritage. Experts believe the items have likely been melted down and smuggled abroad, with only days left to track them down before they are considered permanently lost.",
