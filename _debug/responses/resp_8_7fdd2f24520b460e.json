  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration released two survivors of alleged drug-carrying submarine strikes in the Caribbean, despite claiming they were 'narco-terrorists' posing an imminent threat to American lives. This decision undermines the administration's narrative of a war against drug trafficking, as it contradicts the logic of detaining individuals accused of imminent violence. The lack of public evidence, including drug trafficking data and ties to fentanyl, fuels skepticism. Experts and foreign leaders, such as Colombian President Gustavo Petro, have questioned the administration's claims. The move avoids legal accountability by bypassing U.S. courts or Guantanamo Bay, where habeas corpus challenges could have forced a judicial review. The action reflects a broader pattern of legally dubious decisions, including the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and has prompted growing bipartisan concern from Congress, including from Republican lawmakers like Senator Todd Young.",
