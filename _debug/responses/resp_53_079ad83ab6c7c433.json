  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' mental health care, particularly long-term one-on-one therapy, is being significantly restricted under a new VA policy introduced after 2021, with intensified enforcement under VA Secretary Doug Collins. Veterans like Michael, a combat veteran with PTSD, report being abruptly cut off from therapy, feeling abandoned and re-traumatized. Providers say the policy fails to account for chronic mental health conditions and clinical judgment, with some facing disciplinary actions for opposing session limits. While the VA maintains that there are no hard limits and that care is patient-centered, providers and veterans argue that therapy needs must be individualized and extended based on recovery progress. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the issue and is investigating. Veterans are left with limited options—group therapy or lengthy reapplications—raising serious concerns about access, continuity, and recovery for those with long-term mental health needs.",
