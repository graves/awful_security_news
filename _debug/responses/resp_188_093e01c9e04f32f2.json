  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the ongoing controversy surrounding Prince Andrew, focusing on allegations of inappropriate connections with Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, and questions about whether Buckingham Palace had knowledge of these activities during Prince Andrew's time as a working royal from the late 1990s to 2019. New emails reveal contradictions in Andrew's claims—such as continuing contact with Epstein after 2010 and accessing Giuffre’s personal data—prompting scrutiny of royal oversight and transparency. Despite Prince Andrew voluntarily giving up titles like Duke of York, critics argue the measures are insufficient and call for Parliament to formally remove him from the line of succession or strip him of titles. The Palace maintains that it acted swiftly in response to new evidence, but growing public and political pressure demands greater institutional accountability, especially in light of potential abuse of minors and connections to high-risk networks involving Epstein, Maxwell, and China.",
