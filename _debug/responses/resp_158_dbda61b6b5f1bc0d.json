Cintula, from Levice, claimed he acted out of 'moral despair' and sought to protest government policies, particularly the halt of military aid to Ukraine.

Fico, who has repeatedly accused opposition and media of inciting the attack, has also pushed for reduced support of Ukraine and proposed a constitutional amendment restricting same-sex rights and asserting national law over EU law, raising concerns about democratic backsliding in Slovakia.",
