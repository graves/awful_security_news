The root cause was a technical error during a software update to DynamoDB’s API, which triggered a DNS failure, preventing apps from locating server addresses. This cascaded failure affected 113 AWS services and highlighted the critical dependence of modern digital infrastructure—ranging from banking and gaming to media and smart home devices—on cloud computing.
