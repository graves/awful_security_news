  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has been able to afford his 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor through a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate that involved significant upfront lump-sum payments totaling around £8 million, including renovations. These payments effectively eliminated future rent obligations under a 75-year lease, which ends in 2078. Despite the financial arrangement being justified as providing value for money and avoiding public taxpayer costs, the deal has come under intense public and political scrutiny due to renewed allegations linking Prince Andrew to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre's posthumously-published memoir. The Crown Estate and National Audit Office have confirmed that the arrangement met financial standards, but critics—including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick—have called for greater accountability, transparency, and for Prince Andrew to live in private and pay his fair share. The lease includes provisions for upkeep, restrictions (like no helicopters or gambling), and the possibility of reclaiming payments if Prince Andrew leaves early, though this amount decreases over time. The arrangement remains a source of controversy, highlighting tensions between royal tradition, financial responsibility, and public trust.",
