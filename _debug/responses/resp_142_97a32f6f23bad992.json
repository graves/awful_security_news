  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, restricting 12 out of 17 known rare-earth elements—adding five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to its prior list of seven—effective December 1, 2025. The restrictions target both raw materials and refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals and disclose intended uses. China justifies the move on national security grounds, citing concerns over transfers of controlled materials to military or sensitive applications. The announcement comes just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning China’s actions as a strategic signal to strengthen its negotiating leverage. The US, the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant supply disruptions affecting defense systems such as F-35 jets, submarines, and missiles, as well as civilian technologies like electric vehicles and AI semiconductors. Analysts interpret the move as a deliberate pre-meeting maneuver, highlighting China’s dominance in the global rare-earth supply chain and the deep interdependence of the US and Chinese economies. The restrictions also underscore the vulnerability of US industrial and defense capabilities, while China emphasizes cooperation through multilateral export control dialogues to ensure global supply chain stability.",
