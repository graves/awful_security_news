  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a man pardoned by former President Trump in early 2021 for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been arrested in October 2025 on a charge of making a terroristic threat to U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Court documents reveal that Moynihan allegedly sent text messages threatening to kill Jeffries, including statements such as 'I will kill him for the future' and 'Even if I am hated he must be eliminated.' Moynihan, who had previously served 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release, was released under a pardon along with over 1,500 others. His arrest comes amid a dramatic rise in threats to lawmakers, with Capitol Police reporting approximately 14,000 threat assessments by the end of 2025. The case raises significant concerns about the impact of blanket pardons on public safety and the potential for individuals with prior violent criminal histories to reoffend, exemplified by the earlier death of Matthew Huttle, a pardoned defendant who was killed by law enforcement. This incident underscores the tension between executive clemency and national security.",
