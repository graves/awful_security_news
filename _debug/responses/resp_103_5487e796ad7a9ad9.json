  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study led by behavioral ecologist Nathalie Stroeymeyt and systems biologist Luke Leckie reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected ants are introduced into a colony, the ants respond by building more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and spaced entrances — a form of 'architectural immunity.' This structural adaptation works in tandem with social behaviors, such as infected workers self-isolating and healthy nurses increasing their distance from foragers, to slow disease transmission. The findings represent the first documented case of a non-human social species actively altering its physical environment to combat disease. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest these ant behaviors could inspire new approaches to human public space design, emphasizing the importance of isolating vulnerable individuals and reducing transmission hotspots in urban and communal environments.",
