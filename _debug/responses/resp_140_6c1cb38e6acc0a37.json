Minister Maina Talia emphasizes the need for immediate, substantial financial support, citing a global shortfall where small island states receive only 0.2% of climate finance despite needing $12 billion annually. Tuvalu is leading the world’s first Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty and pushing to list its entire cultural heritage on UNESCO’s World Heritage List to safeguard its identity. The country also highlights the International Court of Justice’s ruling affirming state responsibility for climate action, and criticizes the disproportionate global spending on war versus climate adaptation. Tuvalu sees its cooperation with Australia, including a climate migration visa, as a pathway for human development rather than a sign of collapse, and is preparing for its uncertain future through digital cultural preservation.",
