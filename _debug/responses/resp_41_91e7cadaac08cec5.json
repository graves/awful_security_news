  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supports presidential deference in similar actions in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that protests against immigration enforcement constitute 'violent resistance' and that such decisions are not subject to judicial review. The Department of Justice relies on the 1827 Supreme Court case *Martin v. Mott* to assert that the president has exclusive authority to determine national emergencies. However, Judge April Perry and Illinois officials counter that protests are not equivalent to riots and that local law enforcement is sufficient. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether lower courts correctly blocked the deployment, with a decision expected within days, and the outcome could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the United States.",
