  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Skardu Valley, Indigenous knowledge systems—such as recognizing unusual weather patterns, animal behavior, and using traditional signals like gunfire—are being relied upon to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are increasing due to global warming. Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are often ineffective, malfunctioning, and poorly trusted by local communities. Residents report that warnings have come from individuals like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, who used time-tested human-based methods to save lives, demonstrating the resilience and effectiveness of traditional knowledge in the absence of reliable technology. Climate data shows that Pakistan has warmed 1.3°C since 1950, making it one of the most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions. The article highlights a broader global issue: that technology alone cannot ensure safety without community trust, institutional accountability, and culturally sensitive integration of local knowledge.",
