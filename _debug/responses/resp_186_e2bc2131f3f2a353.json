  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sanae Takaichi has become Japan’s first female prime minister, marking a historic moment in a deeply patriarchal political system. While celebrated by some as a breakthrough for women, critics argue that her conservative policies—such as opposing same-sex marriage, separate surnames, and women’s succession in the imperial family—reinforce traditional gender roles. Her rise is seen as a strategic move by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to consolidate conservative power, with support from figures like Shinzo Abe and Taro Aso. Despite progress in reproductive health, such as the recent approval of over-the-counter access to the morning after pill, Japan remains one of the G7 countries with the lowest female representation in parliament (15.7%). Experts and young women express skepticism about the authenticity of her leadership, warning that it may encourage compliance with the status quo rather than true gender equality. Takaichi faces significant challenges, including economic stagnation, inflation, public distrust, and hosting President Trump, making gender equality a low priority in her policy agenda.",
