  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed expectations of an imminent Trump-Putin summit to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. Initially, Trump announced a meeting in Hungary within two weeks of a phone call with Putin on October 16, but both sides now confirm no such meeting is planned in the near future. Key disagreements persist: Russia demands control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and the dismantling of Ukrainian military capabilities, while Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy advocate for freezing current battle lines as a neutral starting point. A preparatory call between US Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was held and deemed unnecessary, with the US accusing Russia of holding a 'maximalist' position. Russia maintains that its August Alaska summit positions remain unchanged. Ukrainian and European leaders criticize Russia’s stalling tactics, asserting that Ukraine remains the only party committed to peace. As a result, the apparent delay underscores deepening divisions and lack of progress toward a viable ceasefire.",
