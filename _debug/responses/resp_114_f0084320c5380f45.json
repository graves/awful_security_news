  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization, over 500 cancer survivors from across the U.S., including individuals from diverse political backgrounds such as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, united to lobby Congress in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 2025. Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the event emphasized that cancer does not care about political affiliation. Volunteers, including Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, shared personal stories of surviving cancer, highlighting the emotional toll of political division. The group successfully visited 484 congressional offices, advocating for increased funding for cancer research, expanded access to cancer screening, and federal support for health insurance subsidies. While some Republican lawmakers opposed subsidies, bipartisan support emerged for research and screening. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where 10,000 tea lights honored individuals affected by cancer. The article underscores how shared personal experience can foster unity and empathy across political lines in an increasingly divided nation.",
