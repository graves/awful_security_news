  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be contributing to illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. The investigation found that JBS does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through a system of transport permits, obscuring their origins. These cattle are then transported to JBS facilities, enabling deforestation and human rights abuses in protected zones such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. The lack of individual traceability in Brazil's GTA system—relying only on group-level data—makes it impossible to verify the legality of cattle origins. Despite JBS's past promises to trace suppliers (e.g., the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement), it has failed to meet them. The report calls for federal action, including mandatory public access to GTA data and immediate, enforceable traceability mechanisms, warning that current timelines (such as the 2026 Pará decree and 2032 federal plan) are too slow to stop deforestation. The issue is especially urgent ahead of COP30, where global attention on climate and land use will be focused.",
