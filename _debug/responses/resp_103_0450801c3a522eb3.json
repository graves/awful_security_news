  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a lengthy meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Kyiv and Moscow to 'stop where they are' and end the war, advocating for a ceasefire at the current battle lines and suggesting both sides claim victory. This marks a significant shift from Trumpâ€™s earlier support for Ukraine to regain lost territory. Trump expressed hesitation in supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, citing U.S. military stockpiling needs and warning that such a move could damage U.S.-Russia relations. Zelenskyy affirmed the need for such weapons to counter Russian attacks and called for negotiations, while noting Russia remains an enemy due to its aggression. Trump also announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, signaling a move toward direct diplomacy. The article highlights a pivotal moment in U.S. foreign policy where Trump's approach has shifted from active support of Ukraine's territorial recovery to a more conciliatory, ceasefire-focused strategy, raising concerns among Ukrainian officials about military support and the viability of peace negotiations.",
