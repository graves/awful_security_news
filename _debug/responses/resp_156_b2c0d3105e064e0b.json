  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, citing disagreements over military strategy in Gaza, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his support for a partial deal with Hamas. Hanegbi acknowledged responsibility for failures leading to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which Netanyahu’s government has yet to establish. As a result, deputy NSC head Gil Reich has been appointed as acting head of the National Security Council. The move underscores deep political divisions within Israel’s leadership and sparks criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accuse the government of evading accountability. The incident reflects broader tensions over national security policy, accountability for the October 7 attack, and the future direction of Israel’s war on Gaza.",
