The bodies show signs of torture, including binding, blindfolding, gunshot wounds, and trauma consistent with detainee abuse at military bases like Sde Teiman. The origin of the deaths—whether in Gaza, during detention, or during the October 7 attacks—remains unclear. Families, including that of Rasmiya Qdeih, have searched through the remains in an effort to locate missing relatives. The lack of transparency from Israel, including the refusal to release names or details of deaths, has raised serious concerns about enforced disappearance, human rights violations, and the integrity of victim records. Experts like Dr. Lawrence Owens confirm physical evidence of pre-death torture. The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons has condemned Israel’s actions as a violation of human dignity and the right to know.",
