    "The White House is demolishing part of the East Wing to build a $250 million ballroom without approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the federal agency responsible for approving major renovations to government buildings.",

    "The ballroom will be the largest structural change to the White House since the 1948 Truman Balcony addition and is expected to accommodate 999 people (up from 650 initially), surpassing the capacity of the existing East Room.",
    "The National Capital Planning Commission's chairman, Will Scharf, stated that the agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation, which raises legal and procedural questions about the legality and oversight of the project.",
    "The White House has not submitted plans for formal review by the NCPC and has not disclosed full donor information, prompting concerns about transparency and accountability."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is proceeding with the demolition of part of the East Wing to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the federal agency that oversees major renovations to government buildings. President Donald Trump announced the project as a long-standing desire, citing the East Room’s limited capacity and a preference for a central ballroom over outdoor pavilions. The East Wing, built in 1902 and housing the first lady’s offices, will be temporarily relocated during construction. While Trump claims the project is privately funded through donations from businesses and individuals, and Carrier Global Corp. has agreed to provide HVAC systems, the White House has not submitted plans for formal review or disclosed full donor information. The project, expected to be completed by January 2029, has raised significant concerns about transparency, legal compliance, and the impact on historic and functional parts of the White House.",
