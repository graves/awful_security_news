  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a dramatic overtime game on October 19, 2025, No. 16 Missouri defeated Auburn 23-17, marking their first road win of the season and improving to 6-1, 2-1 in the SEC. The victory was powered by Beau Pribula’s 3-yard run in the second overtime and Ahmad Hardy’s 58-yard rushing performance, including a game-tying run late in regulation. Missouri’s defense held Auburn to just 10 points after the opening drive and made a crucial fourth-down stop in overtime to seal the win. Auburn, now 3-4, 0-4 in conference play, continued its offensive struggles, with quarterback Jackson Arnold throwing for 207 yards and one interception, while the team remains without a win in conference play. Coach Hugh Freeze, who is 5-15 in SEC games and 1-19 in his last 20 matchups against ranked opponents, faces ongoing challenges in turning around the team’s performance. The win boosts Missouri’s chances of moving up in the AP Top 25 poll, while Auburn continues to search for its first conference win.",
