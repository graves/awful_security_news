  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing it with family members without proper clearances. The charges, which stem from actions after Bolton left the White House in 2019, allege that sensitive national defense data could have been exposed to hostile foreign actors, such as a cyber actor linked to Iran. Unlike the cases of former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, where Trump directly pressured or replaced prosecutors, Bolton’s case was brought by experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors under the Biden administration. A federal judge previously warned in 2020 that Bolton had jeopardized national security, and a search of his properties was authorized in August 2025. While the stakes in Bolton’s case are significantly higher than in previous political prosecutions—potentially involving national security breaches—Trump has consistently targeted Bolton, publicly accusing him of crimes, stripping him of his security clearance, and referencing him in a 'deep state' list. This case thus stands as a more serious and complex example of political targeting of a former ally, raising concerns about the politicization of the justice system.",
