  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 fatalities and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped, causing one of the funicular cars to derail and crash into a building. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet certification and operational specifications set by CARRIS, the funicular's operator. Additionally, maintenance records show falsified entries, with tasks marked as completed despite being unperformed, and the maintenance plan falsely labeled as 'compliant and accepted.' Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the descent as chaotic and uncontrollable. While the interim findings are preliminary, they highlight significant systemic failures in safety protocols, maintenance, and oversight, raising concerns about public transportation safety in historic urban infrastructure.",
