  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, in response to escalating tensions over drug trafficking, U.S. attacks on vessels allegedly carrying narcotics, and accusations that the U.S. supported a political plot to remove Colombian President Gustavo Petro from power. This marks the second such diplomatic action in 2025, following a prior recall in July. U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified the conflict by accusing Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader,' threatening to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian goods, and authorizing military operations that have destroyed seven vessels and killed at least 30 people, with Petro claiming some victims were Colombian citizens. The actions reflect a deteriorating bilateral relationship rooted in competing narratives over drug policy, sovereignty, and political influence.",
