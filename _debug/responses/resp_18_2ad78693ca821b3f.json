  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a combat freeze, Russian forces have continued advancing in Ukraine, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and drones to target Ukrainian military positions and infrastructure. Key developments include Russian gains near Kupiansk and Vovchansk, and progress toward Pokrovsk, though Ukrainian forces have made counter-gains. Ukrainian military leaders maintain that Russia lacks strategic initiative, despite territorial advances. Russia has suffered massive casualties — with over 250,000 deaths and 950,000 total casualties — potentially affecting its recruitment strategies. In response, Ukraine has increased long-range attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Analysts note that Russia has improved its drone warfare and armored operations, and may now rely on reserve forces. Despite these setbacks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate, indicating the war remains unresolved after over 1,300 days.",
