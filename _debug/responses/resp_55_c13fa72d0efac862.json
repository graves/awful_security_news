  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in March 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic, tetrahydrozoline (from Visine eyedrops), and potassium cyanide. The case began with Craig’s romantic relationships and online research into poisons, including searches for murder methods and lethal dosages. Between February and March 2023, he ordered toxic substances via Amazon and King Soopers, created a fake email account to conduct poison research, and used protein shakes as a delivery method. Medical visits revealed worsening symptoms of arsenic and cyanide poisoning, with toxic levels confirmed in blood samples. The plan was uncovered when office staff, including manager Caitlin Romero and business partner Dr. Ryan Redfearn, raised alarms after noticing suspicious deliveries and behaviors. Angela was pronounced brain dead on March 18, 2023, and Craig was later charged with first-degree murder and additional charges related to plotting to kill others while in prison.",
