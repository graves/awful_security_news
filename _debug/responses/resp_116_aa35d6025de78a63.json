  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has blocked users from creating AI-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after the civil rights leader’s estate raised complaints about offensive, disrespectful depictions, including fake videos of him engaging in racist and illegal behavior. The Sora app, launched three weeks prior, enabled deepfake videos of celebrities and historical figures without consent, prompting backlash from estates, legal experts, and entertainment industry leaders. Experts like Kristelia García argue that OpenAI's 'first-to-market' approach reflects a lack of ethical foresight, while California’s strong right-of-publicity laws give heirs significant control over posthumous use of likenesses. In response, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced changes allowing rights holders to opt in to AI depictions. This incident underscores growing tensions between AI innovation and the rights of deceased public figures, particularly in the context of free speech, defamation, and the ethics of deepfakes.",
