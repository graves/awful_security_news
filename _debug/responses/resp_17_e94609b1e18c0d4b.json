  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A White House proposal offering expanded federal funding to universities in exchange for adopting ideological policies — such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes — has been rejected by five prominent institutions: MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, and the University of Virginia. The proposal, sent to nine universities including Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, and the University of Texas at Austin, includes a requirement for annual anonymous compliance polls and aims to establish a compact that would prioritize funding and access to White House events. Schools like Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona are reviewing the proposal, while the University of Texas at Austin has expressed openness to discussion. The rejections underscore deep concerns among academic leaders about the erosion of academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition, especially in light of threats from state officials like California Governor Gavin Newsom to withhold funding. This represents a broader political struggle over the role of universities in shaping American society and culture.",
