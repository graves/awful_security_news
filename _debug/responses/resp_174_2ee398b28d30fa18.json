  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through a system of transit permits (GTAs) that obscure their origins. This lack of traceability, combined with the state agency Adepará’s authorization of cattle movement into protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, enables illegal land grabs and human rights abuses. Despite JBS’s past promises and a 2024 SEC filing acknowledging tracking limitations, the company has failed to implement effective traceability systems. Advocacy groups urge stronger government action, including making GTA data publicly accessible, and warn that current timelines—such as the 2026 Pará decree and 2032 federal mandate—are too slow to stop deforestation. The findings are especially significant as they are released ahead of COP30, underscoring the global environmental and ethical implications of corporate supply chains in the Amazon.",
