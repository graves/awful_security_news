  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests erupted in Gabes, Tunisia, driven by residents’ outrage over severe pollution from the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which has been blamed for respiratory illness, cancer, and ecological collapse since its opening in 1972. The UGTT labor union led the strike, demanding the immediate shutdown of the plant, citing a broken 2017 promise to phase it out. Despite government efforts to contain emissions with Chinese aid, public anger continues, with over 200 people hospitalized and activists describing the city’s environment as poisoned. The unrest marks a major political test for President Kais Saied, who has described the pollution as an 'environmental assassination' and faces growing pressure to address systemic failures in environmental and social governance.",
