  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 fatalities and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation on Calçada da Glória. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet certification or operational specifications set by CARRIS, the funicular’s operator. Additional failures include incomplete or falsified maintenance records, with tasks marked as completed despite non-performance. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the descent as chaotic and uncontrollable, with a loud bang and visible smoke. The interim report is not final, and a comprehensive final report is expected to be released next year.",
