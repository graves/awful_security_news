The administration argues that the protests against ICE agents constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president has broad, unreviewable authority to deploy federal forces, citing the 1827 precedent of Martin v.

However, Illinois officials and federal judges, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, oppose the move, arguing that protests do not equate to riots and that local law enforcement has effectively managed the situation.
