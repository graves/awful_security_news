  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday. With maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, it is currently located about 300 miles south of Haiti. The storm poses a significant threat to the northern Caribbean, particularly Hispaniola, where heavy rainfall—potentially exceeding one foot—could trigger dangerous flash flooding and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and tropical storm watches are in place for Jamaica. While the chance of direct landfall in the mainland United States is low, it remains possible, especially if the storm shifts course. Forecasters are monitoring two scenarios: one where Melissa turns north and strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane, impacting Hispaniola, and another where it moves westward toward Central America. This storm is part of a trend of rapid intensification observed in recent hurricanes, linked to climate change and warmer ocean waters, and highlights the growing risks associated with tropical cyclones in a warming world.",
