    "Enshittification is a concept coined by Cory Doctorow describing the degradation of internet platforms over time, where companies prioritize profit over user and business value.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (growth and user acquisition), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at user and business detriment).",
    "Doctorow claims Facebook and Amazon have engaged in predatory pricing, data exploitation, algorithmic manipulation, and charging junk fees that erode margins for businesses and consumers.",
    "Amazon is accused of cloning products and gaming search algorithms, with Doctorow citing studies showing the first search result on Amazon is 29% more expensive than the best match, and the best match is located 17 places down.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law.",
    "He proposes solutions including stronger antitrust enforcement, the 'right-to-exit' policy (e.g., allowing users to take e-books with them), and increased interoperability between platforms.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have responded by dismissing Doctorow's claims, asserting their platforms have improved and that fees are optional or reasonable.",
    "The article highlights a growing anti-tech monopoly movement, especially overseas, and suggests policy solutions that are gaining traction across political spectra."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces and expands on the concept of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms into inferior, profit-driven services — arguing that platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber evolve from user-friendly startups into exploitative systems through three stages: user acquisition, business favoritism, and profit maximization. Doctorow claims Facebook manipulates user feeds with targeted ads and forces publishers to publish more content, while Amazon clones products, charges sellers junk fees (up to 51 cents per dollar), and distorts search results, leading to higher prices and lower quality for consumers. He attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak antitrust enforcement, particularly the consumer welfare standard. He proposes solutions including stronger antitrust laws, interoperability, and a 'right-to-exit' policy to allow users to take their data with them. Amazon and Facebook have disputed the claims, asserting their platforms have improved and fees are optional or reasonable. The article highlights a growing global anti-monopoly movement and suggests policy changes that could reverse platform degradation.",
