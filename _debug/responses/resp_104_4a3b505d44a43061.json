    "The term 'enshittification' describes how internet platforms—like Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon—evolve from user-friendly services into exploitative, profit-driven systems over time.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: (1) user acquisition with attractive features and deals, (2) prioritization of business customers at user expense, and (3) monetization through increased fees, poor search quality, and algorithmic manipulation.",
    "Doctorow claims Amazon charges merchants up to 51 cents per dollar earned in fees, and that Amazon's search algorithm favors its own products, leading to higher prices and reduced consumer value.",
    "Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, arguing that their services have improved and that the fees are optional or not misleading.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, particularly the long-standing 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Proposed solutions include stronger antitrust enforcement, the 'right to exit' (e.g., taking e-books or data with you), and enforcing interoperability between platforms (e.g., allowing third-party apps and services to work across devices)."

Doctorow outlines three stages: (1) user acquisition with attractive features and deals, (2) prioritizing business customers at user expense through targeted ads and data harvesting, and (3) monetization via high fees, poor search quality, and algorithmic manipulation. He claims Amazon charges merchants up to 51 cents per dollar earned in fees and manipulates search results, while Facebook forces publishers to publish longer content and charges for boosting ads. These claims are challenged by Amazon and Facebook, which deny the allegations and assert their services have improved. Doctorow attributes the decline to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, particularly the outdated 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law. He proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, the 'right to exit' policy, and increased interoperability between platforms to restore user trust and platform fairness.",
