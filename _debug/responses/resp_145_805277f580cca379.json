  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police in southwest Dublin on October 21, 2025, following allegations that a 26-year-old man—possibly an asylum seeker—sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel in Saggart. The girl, reportedly under state care, had 'absconded' and was reported missing. Protesters launched fireworks, carried signs reading 'Irish lives matter,' and chanted 'Get them out!' A police van was set on fire during the confrontation. The Irish government condemned the events, with Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan and Prime Minister Micheal Martin calling the violence 'unacceptable' and 'extremely serious.' This incident echoes earlier anti-immigrant unrest in Dublin in 2023 after a knife attack, and similar protests in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, in June 2025, following the arrest of Romanian boys on suspicion of assaulting a teenage girl. These events reflect a broader national rise in anti-immigration sentiment, particularly targeting asylum seekers and foreign nationals, despite Ireland’s absence of far-right parliamentary representation.",
