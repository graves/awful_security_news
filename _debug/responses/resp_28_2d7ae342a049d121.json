  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fatal crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped mid-journey. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator, CARRIS, and that maintenance records were falsified, with tasks marked as completed even when not performed. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the descent as chaotic and terrifying. While the interim report highlights serious failures in cable integrity, maintenance practices, and braking systems, it is noted that the findings are preliminary and a final report is expected next year.",
