  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Stephen Bryant, a South Carolina inmate, is scheduled for execution on November 14, 2025, after being convicted of murdering Willard 'TJ' Tietjen and two other men in October 2004 during a wave of terror in Sumter County. Bryant allegedly stopped at Tietjen’s isolated home, shot him multiple times, and wrote a taunt in blood on the wall, prompting fear among residents. He also killed two men while giving them rides, shooting them in the back as they urinated on rural roads. His defense claims he suffered from trauma from childhood sexual abuse and used drugs to cope. The state Supreme Court denied a delay request due to a federal government shutdown. Bryant has until October 31 to choose his method of execution—lethal injection, firing squad, or electric chair. The method of execution has faced criticism, with past inmates alleging prolonged suffering during firing squad and paralysis during lethal injection. This execution marks the 50th in South Carolina since 1985 and the seventh in less than 14 months, reflecting broader national execution trends with at least five more scheduled in 2025.",
