  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A high-profile heist at Paris’ Louvre Museum in 2025, where thieves used industrial tools to steal Napoleonic crown jewels from the Apollo Gallery during museum hours, reflects a dangerous shift in museum crime: from stealing art for cultural value to stealing raw materials for financial gain. The incident is seen as a modern evolution of 'cultural terrorism,' echoing previous heists like the 2019 Green Vault robbery in Dresden, and raising concerns about security vulnerabilities in public museums. Physical evidence, including discarded tools and a damaged crown of Empress Eugénie, supports the brazen and organized nature of the crime. Experts believe this trend signals a growing threat to global cultural heritage, with French authorities suspecting a link between multiple recent heists in Paris, possibly involving organized crime groups like the Remmo Clan. Interpol has officially recorded the stolen artifacts, and national leaders, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have expressed deep public concern over the exposed failures in museum security.",
