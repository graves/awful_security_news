  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally renounced all royal titles and honours, including the Duke of York and membership in the Order of the Garter, amid renewed allegations that he sexually exploited Virginia Giuffre when she was 17. The reports, first published by British newspapers including the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Telegraph, allege that in 2011, Andrew requested personal information from his police protection officer — including her date of birth and social security number — to investigate her. These claims, coupled with his prior ties to Jeffrey Epstein and alleged grooming of minors, have intensified public and political pressure. Survivor Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced into three sexual encounters with Prince Andrew, with one at Ghislaine Maxwell’s London home in 2001, and others in New York and on Epstein’s private island. She also claims she agreed to a gag order to protect the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022. Prince William has expressed disapproval, and survivors and family members, including Sky Roberts and Haley Robson, have called on King Charles III to formally strip Andrew of his title as a matter of accountability. The upcoming posthumous memoir by Giuffre is expected to further expose the alleged connections. The article underscores a broader shift in public expectations for the monarchy to uphold accountability, especially in cases involving abuse and exploitation.",
