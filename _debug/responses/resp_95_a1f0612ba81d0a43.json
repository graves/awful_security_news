  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced on October 19, 2025, that he would end all US payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to suppress drug production despite years of financial support. The move escalates a long-standing diplomatic and security conflict between the two leaders, rooted in disputes over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean. The US has historically provided billions of dollars in aid, including $210 million this fiscal year, with Colombia being the world’s leading producer of cocaine. Recent strikes on alleged drug boats, including one resulting in the deaths of all on board and another with survivors returned, have intensified tensions. Petro responded with cultural and ideological criticism, invoking Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez to highlight US ignorance of Colombian society. The episode marks a significant shift in US foreign policy toward Colombia, with financial and military actions reflecting a deepening crisis in transnational drug control and diplomatic relations.",
