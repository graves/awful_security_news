  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major national disaster for France, thieves stole nine high-value historical artifacts from the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery in Paris on Sunday, October 20, 2025, during a seven-minute heist. The stolen items include a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace and earrings from Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and several pieces from Empress Eugénie’s collection, such as a reliquary brooch and a diamond bow brooch. The crown of Empress Eugénie was targeted but recovered near the scene, though damaged. Experts like Arthur Brand describe the theft as a profound loss of national heritage, as these items represent key pieces of French royal history and are likely to be dismantled and sold. The items were crafted by renowned 19th-century jewelers, including François-Régnault Nitot, Paul-Alfred Bapst, and Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier, and had complex histories of ownership, including periods in private hands and institutions like Van Cleef & Arpels and the Smithsonian. The theft has sparked widespread concern over the security of cultural treasures and the global value of French historical artifacts.",
