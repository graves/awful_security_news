  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees major federal construction projects. The East Wing, a historically significant area housing the first lady's offices, is being partially torn down, with visible demolition photos showing damage to the façade and windows. Trump claims the ballroom is necessary due to the East Room’s limited capacity and asserts it aligns with a long-standing presidential tradition, though he previously stated that nothing would be torn down. The project is being privately funded by Trump and corporate donors, including Carrier Global Corp., which has donated an HVAC system. The White House has not submitted plans for review, and transparency about donors remains limited. Critics and officials question the legality, historical impact, and compliance with federal regulations, especially given that the National Capital Planning Commission has jurisdiction over such renovations. The ballroom is expected to be completed before Trump’s term ends in January 2029.",
