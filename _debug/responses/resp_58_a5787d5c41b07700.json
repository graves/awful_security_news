  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively scrutinizing the federal government’s response to anti-immigration protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement campaign that resulted in over 1,000 arrests. In a hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for federal agents on the ground, especially to address concerns about the use of tear gas and pepper balls without warning. CBP agents are equipped with cameras, while ICE Special Response Teams are not, and have faced criticism for their lack of equipment. The judge questioned both CBP and ICE officials about training, enforcement protocols, and transparency, particularly in light of a reported incident involving Pastor David Black being attacked without warning. Federal leadership has been described as a 'revolving door,' with key officers like Russell Hott leaving the Chicago area, prompting further depositions. The Trump administration has denied reports of tear gas use without warning, while internal reviews of force incidents are conducted by ICE leadership. The case underscores ongoing tensions between federal law enforcement, civil liberties, and media transparency during protests.",
