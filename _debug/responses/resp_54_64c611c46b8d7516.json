  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown in October 2025, the Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue—typically used for child nutrition—to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable families. This decision was made after Congress failed to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill, threatening to shut down WIC operations. While the National WIC Association welcomes the effort to keep the program running, it raises concerns about the amount, timing, and duration of funding. Legal experts question the administration’s authority to use tariff funds without congressional appropriation. The plan was announced by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and has drawn bipartisan political attention, with figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson criticizing Democrats for political shutdowns. Despite WIC's long-standing bipartisan support and recent enrollment growth, advocates stress that long-term, stable funding is needed to prevent cuts amid inflation and rising food costs.",
