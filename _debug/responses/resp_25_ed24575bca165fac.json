    "A significant power imbalance exists between male management and female workers, leading to widespread reports of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching.",
    "Workers face severe suppression of labor rights: union activities are met with threats, violence, and dismissal; labor inspectors are blocked from entering factories or are met with resistance.",
    "Only 9% of Guatemalan textile factories allow workers' unions, and the threat of retaliation has created a culture of fear, especially after incidents like the assassination of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal.",
    "Despite reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, enforcement of labor laws remains weak, and workers remain economically vulnerable, with many losing pensions and severance payments after factory closures.",
    "The broader global supply chain is at risk due to US import tariffs, which may disrupt apparel production and increase costs, particularly in countries like Haiti and Lesotho, exposing workers to further economic hardship."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the hidden labor exploitation within Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where women workers endure brutal conditions including long hours, low pay, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite being key to Guatemala’s economy—contributing nearly 10% of GDP—these factories operate under a culture of fear, with unions suppressed, inspections blocked, and workers denied basic rights. US fashion brands like Ralph Lauren, Target, and Carhartt source from Guatemalan factories, often through Korean-owned intermediaries who lack legal accountability. Workers such as Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face job loss, pension theft, and psychological trauma. Union leaders have been murdered or threatened, and labor enforcement remains weak, even under the progressive leadership of President Bernardo Arévalo. The article underscores systemic failure, with workers unable to escape exploitation and future economic instability looming due to global supply chain disruptions and tariff policies.",
