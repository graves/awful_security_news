He was extradited to Utah in early 2024, where he faced a second trial and conviction. A Utah judge sentenced him to five years to life in prison, citing him as a 'serial abuser' and 'flight risk.' The victim in the first case testified about financial exploitation and abuse, while Rossi maintained his innocence during the trial. He previously failed to register as a sex offender and had a history of using aliases, including Arthur Knight.
