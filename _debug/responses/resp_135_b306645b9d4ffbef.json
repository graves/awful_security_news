  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president-elect in over two decades, won the presidential runoff with 54.5% of the vote, signaling a decisive end to decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. In a significant shift, Paz pledged to rebuild relations with the United States, particularly the Trump administration, and to attract foreign investment, reversing years of isolation and antipathy toward U.S. policy. He rejected an IMF bailout due to public resentment toward international financial institutions, instead focusing on targeted economic reforms such as direct cash transfers to poor families and ending universal fuel subsidies. His running mate, Edman Lara, a former police captain and social media activist, helped mobilize working-class and rural voters by denouncing corruption. Despite promises, Bolivia faces severe economic challenges including fuel shortages, high inflation (23% in September), and a depleted foreign exchange reserve. Paz emphasized that his priority is 'putting the house in order' — including reforming the judiciary and restoring faith in institutions — before pursuing foreign investment. This shift is also reflected in his outreach to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, signaling a break from Venezuela’s repressive regime. The election has triggered protests from Quiroga supporters, who allege fraud and express distrust in Bolivia’s electoral system, highlighting the fragility of political legitimacy in the face of deep societal divisions.",
