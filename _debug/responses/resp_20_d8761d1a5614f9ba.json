  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man from Rhode Island, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. After being identified through a decade-old DNA match from a rape kit backlog, he attempted to evade justice by faking his death in 2020, with an online obituary claiming he died of lymphoma. He was later arrested in Scotland in 2021 due to distinctive tattoos recognized by Interpol, and extradited to Utah in January 2024. A Utah judge sentenced him to five years to life in prison, calling him a 'serial abuser' and 'flight risk.' The victims testified about financial manipulation and abuse during their relationships, with one describing the trauma as a 'trail of fear and pain.' Rossi, who had used at least a dozen aliases, maintained his innocence during sentencing. He previously faced sex offender registration issues in Rhode Island and fraud charges in Ohio. This case underscores the importance of forensic DNA databases, international law enforcement cooperation, and accountability for serial predators.",
