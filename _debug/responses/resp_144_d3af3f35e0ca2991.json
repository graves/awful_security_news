    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of the 17 known rare-earth elements, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, in addition to seven previously restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw materials (e.g., rare-earth magnets) and specialized equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain Beijing’s special approval with a detailed explanation of the intended use.",
    "China cites national security concerns, particularly due to evidence of foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military applications, as justification for the controls.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth of such products in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth compound imports sourced from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for advanced defense technologies (such as F-35 fighter jets, submarines, Tomahawk missiles, and AI systems) and civilian technologies like electric vehicles, LED screens, and medical imaging.",
    "China's actions are viewed as a strategic signal ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit, demonstrating its leverage in trade negotiations and signaling willingness to weaponize its dominance in the rare-earth supply chain.",
    "While the controls are framed as national security measures, experts note that they also threaten US industrial capabilities and could deepen the US-China technological and supply chain divide.",
    "Exemptions exist for exports related to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief, ensuring continuity in humanitarian and health-related applications."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), and restricted the export of specialized refining equipment. The restrictions, set to take effect on December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain Beijing’s approval with a clear explanation of the product’s intended use. China justifies these measures as national security actions, citing evidence of foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes. The move comes just weeks before a high-level meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning China to strengthen its leverage during negotiations. The United States, which imported $22.8 million worth of Chinese rare-earth products in 2023 and relied on China for 70% of its rare-earth imports between 2020 and 2023, is particularly vulnerable, as critical defense technologies—including F-35 jets, submarines, Tomahawk missiles, and AI systems—depend on these materials. Experts interpret the controls as a strategic signaling maneuver to pressure the U.S. during trade talks, highlighting the deep interdependence and strategic competition in the global supply chain.",
