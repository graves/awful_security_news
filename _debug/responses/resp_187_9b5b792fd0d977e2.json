    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza marks Israel's temporary military withdrawal, leaving it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip and serving as the first stage of Donald Trump's peace plan.",
    "The yellow line is being framed by Israeli media as 'effectively the new border', which pleases Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners and may signal a de facto border that could allow for new settlements.",
    "Washington, through Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is urging Netanyahu to 'show restraint' and avoid breaking the ceasefire, indicating U.S. pressure to maintain stability in negotiations.",
    "Despite Israel's claim that Hamas violated the ceasefire by killing soldiers, Israel responded with limited air strikes and emphasized that the attack occurred within the yellow line, signaling a desire to comply with the ceasefire terms and avoid conflict with the U.S.",
    "Netanyahu maintains that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized, but Israeli commentators suggest that U.S. decision-making is increasingly shaping military actions in Gaza.",
    "The second stage of the peace plan, involving power transfer and Hamas disarmament, remains unresolved and may determine whether the yellow line becomes permanent or whether further withdrawals occur.",
    "Netanyahu's coalition partners, especially hardliners, want the yellow line to become a permanent boundary and even advocate for annexing Gaza, reflecting ideological tensions within Israel's political structure.",
    "While most Israelis support ending the war and bringing hostages and soldiers home, Netanyahu's strategy of maintaining flexibility in the peace process allows him to balance domestic and international pressures."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The yellow line, a temporary military boundary in Gaza established under Donald Trump's peace plan, marks Israel's first stage of withdrawal, leaving it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip. While this move pleases Netanyahu’s far-right coalition allies, it also creates tension between domestic hardline demands — such as the expansion of settlements and annexation — and U.S. pressure to maintain ceasefire stability. Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, emphasize that Hamas must disarm for peace to be achieved, but U.S. negotiators like JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner are urging restraint to preserve the fragile ceasefire. The unresolved issues of power transfer and Hamas disarmament in the second stage of the plan suggest that the yellow line may become de facto, especially if negotiations stall. Despite public support for ending the war and bringing home hostages, Netanyahu’s strategy of preserving flexibility allows him to navigate competing domestic and international pressures.",
