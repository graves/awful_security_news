  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' mental health care, particularly long-term one-on-one therapy, is being restricted at VA facilities across the U.S., with providers reporting that they are mandated to end therapy sessions early—often without clinical justification—despite patients’ ongoing needs. This policy, intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since 2021, has led to staff resignations, provider discipline, and veteran distress. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned, re-traumatized, or left to manage worsening symptoms. While some private-sector models use session limits, providers argue that mental illnesses like PTSD require open-ended, individualized care. The VA and its spokesperson, Peter Kasperowicz, deny systemic limitations, but internal reports and professional bodies like the APA indicate a serious concern about the appropriateness and humanity of current policies.",
