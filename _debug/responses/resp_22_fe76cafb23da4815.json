  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US government, under President Donald Trump, released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries—Colombia and Ecuador—after the US claimed to have destroyed a 'submarine' carrying four narcoterrorists. One survivor, Jeison Obando Perez from Colombia, arrived with severe injuries and is being medically treated and prosecuted. The action marks the first time the Trump administration has detained individuals after a military drug interdiction strike, raising legal questions about the constitutional authority to detain without due process. The strikes are part of a broader campaign to disrupt drug trafficking and pressure Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro. However, Colombia's President Gustavo Petro accused the US of violating territorial waters and killing a civilian fishing boat crew in a prior strike, claiming the boat was adrift and not involved in drug trade. This has intensified diplomatic tension and highlighted a significant legal and ethical dilemma over the use of military force in drug interdiction.",
