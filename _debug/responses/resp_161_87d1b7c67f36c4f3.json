  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has suffered a recent heist in which eight Napoleonic pieces of jewellery were stolen in a four-minute attack using a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder. This marks a shift from previous high-profile thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist and the 1990 theft of a Renoir painting, which primarily targeted paintings. The current theft is particularly concerning due to the high intrinsic value of jewellery, which can be recut and sold in components, making it nearly impossible to trace. The incident echoes historical vulnerabilities, such as the 1940 Nazi occupation, when museum staff preemptively moved artworks to protect them. The 1911 Mona Lisa theft, involving Vincenzo Peruggia and later linked to figures like Picasso and Apollinaire, helped elevate the painting's global fame. Experts like Noah Charney emphasize that such jewellery thefts are distinct in their material value and difficulty of recovery, requiring a large reward for the return of intact items to have any chance of success.",
