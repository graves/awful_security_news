  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats are re-emphasizing abortion rights as a core campaign issue, despite broader economic focus, to counter Republican positions and build voter trust. In Virginia, where abortion access remains protected since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Democratic candidates like Abigail Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi are using personal narratives and policy messaging to highlight reproductive rights. Spanberger has invested heavily in abortion-related advertising and criticized Republican opponent Winsome Earle-Sears for her anti-abortion stance. Similar strategies are evident in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and California. Republicans have tried to downplay or avoid the issue, with some candidates like Jack Ciattarelli and Jason Miyares supporting exceptions in limited cases. The article notes that while abortion is not the top voter concern, trust in Democratic candidates on reproductive rights is significantly higher. Democrats plan to push for a constitutional abortion rights measure in Virginia next year, and activists warn that ongoing federal scrutiny of abortion drugs and cuts to Planned Parenthood funding could lead to further restrictions. This political shift reflects a broader strategy to balance economic policy with social issues, especially in the context of the 2026 midterms.",
