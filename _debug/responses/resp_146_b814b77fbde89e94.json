  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Indigenous knowledge systems—such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, heavy rain, or using traditional signals like gunfire or fire—are proving more effective than government early warning systems in detecting and responding to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite spending over $37 million on EWS projects like GLOF-II, communities report widespread distrust due to frequent system failures, lack of real-time communication, and poor community engagement. Real-life examples, such as shepherds Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, show how traditional knowledge and community-driven action have saved lives, while official systems remain ineffective or unresponsive. This highlights a broader challenge: climate resilience cannot rely solely on technology without community trust, cultural sensitivity, and participatory design.",
