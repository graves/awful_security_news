  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in October 2025, tourists continue to visit national parks such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and New River Gorge, despite closures of entrances, visitor centers, and park rangers. While some local businesses report no immediate impact, others face declining bookings or increased safety risks. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of park staff creates dangers including illegal activities like drone flights and base jumping, and increases trash accumulation and vandalism. In Washington, D.C., closures of federal institutions like the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo have led to a surge in visitors to private attractions. However, the shutdown has also caused significant economic losses, with estimates of $47.4 million in revenue lost in DC, and local business owners in West Virginia express concern about long-term effects on tourism and livelihoods. The article underscores the tension between public access and safety, calling for potential park closures to protect both natural resources and visitor well-being.",
