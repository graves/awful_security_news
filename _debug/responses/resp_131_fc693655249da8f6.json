Cleary was extradited from France in 2024 after being detained on a vagrancy charge, and he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault. Despite his remorse and history of mental illness, the judge, Kevin Hess, imposed a sentence below state guidelines, citing his admission of guilt and desire for atonement. The case highlights systemic failures in campus sexual assault investigations, including destroyed evidence and long delays in prosecution, and underscores the emotional toll on survivors. The message Cleary sent to Keeler saying 'So I raped you' re-opened trauma and symbolized the enduring impact of sexual violence and institutional neglect.",
