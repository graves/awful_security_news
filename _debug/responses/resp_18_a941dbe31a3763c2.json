  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 23-year-old Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, went missing on October 4, 2025, after disconnecting from her phone and social media after leaving work. Two weeks later, human remains of an unidentified female were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school, prompting officials to suspect they may belong to Scott. Police believe Keon King, a 21-year-old man previously charged with a similar kidnapping case, is responsible, as he was the last person in contact with her and has a history of violent behavior. Investigators used phone tracking to identify King and received a crucial anonymous tip that led to both the grave and the car linked to him. The case is now under joint investigation by the Philadelphia Police Department and the FBI’s Violent Crime Task Force. Authorities are examining King’s prior case, which was refiled after a witness failed to appear, and are exploring a potential pattern of criminal behavior. The family, especially Scott’s parents, are calling on the public to provide information, and the medical examiner is currently assessing whether the remains belong to Kada Scott.",
