  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a demonstration of unity amid national political division, over 500 cancer survivors, including Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin from New York, volunteered to lobby Congress in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 2025. Despite their differing political affiliations—Johnson having voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing being a Democrat, and Martin refraining from political discussion—the volunteers united around a shared experience with cancer. Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the event occurred during a federal government shutdown due to a budget impasse, making the bipartisan advocacy even more significant. Volunteers, dressed in matching blue polo shirts and armed with red folders, visited 484 congressional offices to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and continued health insurance subsidies. While some Republican lawmakers resisted subsidy extensions, both parties supported research and screening initiatives. The day concluded with a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, honoring 10,000 names of individuals affected by cancer. The event underscores that personal health experiences can transcend partisan politics, offering a model of unity and shared purpose in a deeply divided nation.",
