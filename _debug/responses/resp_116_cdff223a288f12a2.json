  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the federal deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, citing urgent threats to federal personnel safety in Chicago. This comes after a lower court denied the request, with the administration arguing that such deployment is both necessary and within the President's constitutional authority. The case is part of a broader pattern of Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops in cities like Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, and Washington, D.C., to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, all of which have faced legal challenges over executive overreach. State officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California's Gavin Newsom, have opposed these deployments, asserting that they violate state sovereignty and exceed presidential power. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also sent troops, showing a regional alignment. The Supreme Court has requested responses from Illinois and Chicago officials by Monday, marking a critical juncture in the constitutional debate over federal military authority in civilian areas.",
