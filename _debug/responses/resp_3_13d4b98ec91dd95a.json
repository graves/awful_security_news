  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution mandates that all duly elected members must be sworn in, and that the Speaker has no constitutional authority to delay the process. Johnson claims he is following the precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asserting that members elected during a recess should be seated after the House returns to session. However, the lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s delay is politically motivated, aimed at blocking a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and advancing budget negotiations. Despite having no dispute over Grijalva’s qualifications, Johnson has refused to administer the oath, with Mayes arguing that the Speaker is arbitrarily withholding the right to serve. The case raises constitutional and democratic concerns about the legitimacy of elected representatives and the balance of power within Congress.",
