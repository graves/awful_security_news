  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with threatening to assault, kidnap, or murder U.S. federal officials after posting a series of TikTok videos between August and October 2025. In those videos, he called for the shooting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, referenced the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by suggesting 'doing a lot more Charlie Kirks,' and promoted the idea that violence against federal agents is justified. Federal investigators initiated the probe after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, which flagged a request for information on Israeli military locations. Despite multiple attempts to contact him, Stanton refused to engage, including a hostile response to a direct message from a US Customs and Border Patrol supervisor. He is currently in federal detention pending a pretrial conference on December 1, 2025, and a trial on December 15, 2025. His attorney has stated that the criminal complaint contains only allegations and that Stanton is presumed innocent.",
