  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A woman in her 20s in Osan, South Korea, attempted to kill a cockroach using an improvised flamethrower made from a lighter and flammable spray, which ignited a fire in her apartment building. The blaze spread, causing thick smoke that blocked the stairway, leading the couple living on the fifth floor—consisting of a Chinese woman in her 30s and her husband—to attempt escape through a window. The woman fell from the window and died from smoke inhalation, while her husband survived. Eight other residents sustained smoke inhalation injuries. Police are seeking an arrest warrant for the woman on charges of accidental fire and causing death by negligence. This incident reflects a dangerous trend of using homemade flamethrowers for pest control, a method popularized by social media content, as seen previously in an Australian case in 2018.",
