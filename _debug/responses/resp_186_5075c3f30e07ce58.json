  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts to resolve the war in Ukraine, contrasting his successful negotiation of a ceasefire in Gaza with his failure to achieve similar results in Ukraine. The Gaza breakthrough relied on a strategic move by Israel to attack Hamas negotiators in Qatar, which gave Trump leverage over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In contrast, Trump lacks the same leverage in Ukraine, where he has failed to secure a deal with either Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelensky. Attempts to hold a summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest have been canceled, and Trump’s threats to impose sanctions or send advanced weapons to Ukraine have met with limited success. Zelensky has noted that Russia’s interest in diplomacy wanes when Ukraine’s military options are reduced, and Trump’s belief in face-to-face diplomacy may be being exploited by Putin. The article concludes that the complexity and duration of the Ukraine conflict, combined with the unwillingness of either side to make concessions, make a swift resolution impossible, and that Trump's earlier campaign promise to end the war in hours has been abandoned in favor of a more realistic, difficult assessment of diplomatic limitations.",
