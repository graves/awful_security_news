    "Israel has implemented new regulations requiring international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under strict ideological criteria, effectively threatening to shut down major humanitarian groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
    "The re-registration process includes approval by a committee with representatives from Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, and de-registration reasons include alleged support for 'terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism', which aid groups argue are broadly applied and politically motivated.",
    "Major organizations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Mercy Corps have been denied access to Gaza, with some already de-registered and forced into appeal processes.",
    "The Israeli military continues to block key border crossings, with only two of seven currently open, and allows only a fraction of incoming trucks to be classified as humanitarian aid.",
    "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has been banned from operating in Gaza since March 2025, despite having 12,000 staff and managing critical services like shelter, health care, and sanitation.",
    "UNRWA has large food and medical supplies stored in Jordan and Egypt, sufficient to feed Gaza’s population for three months, but these remain inaccessible due to Israeli restrictions.",
    "The United States previously cut funding to UNRWA, which has significantly reduced its financial stability and capacity to operate, even as other countries increase contributions.",
    "Humanitarian officials say the intent behind the re-registration process is not to facilitate aid delivery but to delegitimize organizations through ideological grounds, undermining humanitarian access and stability in Gaza."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has launched an unprecedented campaign to restrict international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank by requiring all non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under new ideological criteria. These rules, enforced by COGAT, include disqualifying organizations based on alleged support for 'terrorist activities' or 'racist incitement', which aid groups say are applied broadly and politically. The Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps are among the major groups affected, with some already de-registered. Israel continues to block key aid entry points, including Rafah, and has banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), which has been the primary humanitarian provider in Gaza for decades. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, delivery remains severely limited, with humanitarian officials warning of famine and widespread suffering. The U.S. cut funding to UNRWA in 2024, further destabilizing operations, while the EU provides some support. Humanitarian leaders argue the policy is not about safety or efficiency, but about politically motivated de-registration to dismantle international aid presence.",
