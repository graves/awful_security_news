  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced he would end all U.S. payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to stop drug production despite years of financial support. The move escalates a long-standing diplomatic rift rooted in disputes over drug trafficking, migration, and US military strikes in the Caribbean. Colombia, the world’s leading cocaine producer, has been a key U.S. ally in security, receiving billions in annual funding. Petro responded with cultural criticism, referencing Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez to assert Colombia’s values and reject Trump’s characterization of him as a drug trafficker. The situation reflects deeper tensions between U.S. foreign policy and national sovereignty, as well as the role of military action and economic aid in global drug control efforts.",
