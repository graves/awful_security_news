  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed formal approval of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 and incentivized cleaner fuels, was originally approved in April but was now postponed due to political pressure. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain remained behind, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted or voted to delay. The move undermines global progress on decarbonizing shipping, which is critical to meeting climate targets, and has been criticized by the UN and the International Chamber of Shipping as a missed opportunity for urgent climate action. Despite the setback, environmental leaders stress that international law and the urgency of climate change remain central to pushing forward.",
