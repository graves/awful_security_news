  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two top Chinese military leaders, He Weidong and Miao Hua, have been expelled from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army over corruption charges, marking one of the most significant purges of senior military officials since the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution. He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking general and former vice-chair of the Central Military Commission, is particularly notable due to his close ties with President Xi Jinping and his role in planning aggressive military drills around Taiwan following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit in 2022. The expulsions are part of a broader anti-corruption campaign initiated in 2023 and are expected to be formalized at the upcoming Central Committee Fourth Plenum. These actions signal a consolidation of power within the military and party leadership, with implications not only for China’s internal governance but also for regional stability, especially in cross-strait relations. Other officials, including former political commissars and military commanders, have also been removed, indicating a wide-reaching effort to purge perceived corruption and ensure loyalty to the central authority.",
