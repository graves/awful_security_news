  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF)—a proposed global carbon-pricing system to reduce shipping emissions—by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The NZF, which would impose a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess CO2 emissions from ships, was previously approved in April by 63 IMO members. Despite broad international backing from nations like China, the EU, and Britain, Trump's public condemnation of the framework as a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' led to a shift in voting, with Argentina and Singapore joining in delaying the vote. The delay undermines global climate goals, including the IMO’s target of cutting shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050. Climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s minister for climate change and the International Chamber of Shipping, criticized the move as a setback for urgent climate action, emphasizing the need for clarity and stability in maritime decarbonization policies.",
