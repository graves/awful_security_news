  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture — part of a broader set of Trump-era trade policies including 50% tariffs on steel and copper — are driving up construction and renovation costs. These increases have already strained homebuilders, furniture manufacturers like RH and IKEA, and individual homebuyers such as Anthony Cabrera in New Jersey. Economists warn that the cumulative effect of these tariffs, especially with future increases expected in January, will intensify an already weak housing market by raising input costs and deterring investment in both new construction and home improvements. Consumers are expected to bear up to 55% of the tariff burden, leading to higher prices across the housing supply chain. While not immediately catastrophic, the tariffs contribute to ongoing uncertainty and inflation, threatening affordability and slowing development, particularly in affordable housing segments.",
