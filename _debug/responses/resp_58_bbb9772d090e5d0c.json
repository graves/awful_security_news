  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's working lunch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, citing the 'realities of where the conflict stands' and advocating for a ceasefire along current battle lines. The meeting, which followed a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin proposing a territorial exchange involving eastern Donbas for parts of southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, revealed deep disagreements over the war's resolution. Trump reportedly raised his voice and made direct demands, while Zelensky expressed pessimism about the proposed terms and downplayed reports of shouting, calling the meeting a 'pointed conversation' that nonetheless reached agreement on a ceasefire at existing front lines. Trump denied asking for the full surrender of Donbas, stating that 78% of Ukrainian land is already occupied. The episode reflects a significant shift in Trump's approach to the war, now prioritizing a rapid peace settlement influenced by his recent success in brokering a Gaza truce. Ukrainian officials and European sources describe the dialogue as tense but constructive, with both leaders agreeing on key next steps, though major concerns remain about Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the sustainability of peace.",
