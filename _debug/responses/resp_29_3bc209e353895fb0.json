  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking network, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' alleging that she was raped and brutally assaulted by a man referred to as a 'well-known Prime Minister' in the US version—identified as Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles III. The memoir claims that Andrew, while in a relationship with Epstein, sexually abused her when she was 17, laughed during the assault, and continued to maintain contact with Epstein after claiming they had broken off ties. Giuffre alleges that Andrew’s team attempted to hire online trolls to discredit her, and that he settled a civil case for millions, which she sees as a cover-up. The memoir intensifies the transatlantic scandal involving powerful figures’ ties to Epstein, with new evidence including emails from 2011 showing Andrew’s continued contact with Epstein. This has led to renewed public and political scrutiny of Prince Andrew and the British royal family, with Andrew recently relinquishing his title of Duke of York but retaining the title of prince.",
