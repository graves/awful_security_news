  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants could prevent peanut allergies, new research confirms that changes in medical practice—starting in 2015 and expanded in 2017—have led to a significant decline in peanut allergy rates in the U.S. The data show a 27% drop in allergies among children aged 0 to 3 after 2015 and a 40% drop after 2017, with about 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies since then. The findings are based on analysis of electronic health records from pediatric practices and support the 2021 recommendation that children be introduced to peanuts and other major allergens between 4 and 6 months of age, without screening. Experts like Dr. David Hill and Gideon Lack have played key roles in shaping these guidelines, and advocacy groups like FARE support the shift. Despite initial slow adoption, the research shows that early allergen introduction is being adopted and making a measurable public health impact.",
