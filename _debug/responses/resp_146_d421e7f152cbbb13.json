    "China has tightened export controls on 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, in addition to seven previously restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions apply to both the export of rare-earth metals and specialized technological equipment used to refine these metals.",
    "Foreign companies must obtain special approvals from China to export products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals, and must justify the intended use of such products.",
    "China cites national security and international non-proliferation concerns, citing direct or indirect transfer of rare-earth materials for military applications.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports sourced from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for defence technologies (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, missiles) and civilian technology (e.g., electric vehicles, AI, smartphones, medical imaging).",
    "This move is seen as a strategic signal ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, to strengthen China’s leverage in trade negotiations.",
    "The US has previously restricted China’s access to semiconductors, but China’s action shows its ability to restrict US access to critical materials, highlighting economic interdependence.",
    "China claims the restrictions are part of international norms and do not affect emergency medical or disaster relief exports."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added ones, and on specialized refining equipment, effective from December 1, 2025. The move comes just before a key diplomatic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. China justifies the controls on national security grounds, citing military applications and unauthorized transfers of rare-earth materials. The US, the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruption in critical industries such as defence (including F-35 jets, submarines, missiles) and civilian technology (like electric vehicles, AI, smartphones). Analysts interpret the action as a strategic signal to strengthen China's leverage in upcoming trade negotiations, highlighting the deep interdependence between the US and China in global supply chains, despite efforts to decouple. The restrictions do not apply to emergency medical or disaster relief exports.",
