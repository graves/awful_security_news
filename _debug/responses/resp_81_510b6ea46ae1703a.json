Mayor Rodney Craig affirmed that the village conducted thorough hiring procedures and will monitor Bojovic’s immigration status, with potential return to duty if he is legally authorized to remain. This case parallels a previous ICE arrest of an Iowa school superintendent, highlighting a growing pattern of immigration enforcement targeting public officials.",
