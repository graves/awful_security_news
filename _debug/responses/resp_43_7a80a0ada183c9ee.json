  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual US-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm along with marijuana and cocaine. The prosecution claims Hemani’s habitual drug use poses a public safety risk, while a lower court and the 5th Circuit ruled that such a prohibition must have historical roots and cannot target habitual users. The Trump administration appealed the decision, arguing that impaired, habitual drug users with firearms present a grave danger to public safety, citing alleged ties to Iran and travel to Iran in connection with the death of Qasem Soleimani. Hemani’s legal team counters that the historical justification for the law is weak, especially given that nearly half of US states have legalized recreational marijuana, suggesting a significant overlap between legal marijuana use and gun ownership. The case has broader implications for Second Amendment rights, drug policy, and the balance between public safety and constitutional protections. President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding political significance. The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026.",
