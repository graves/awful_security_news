  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Astoria, Queens, exemplifies a rare success in U.S. manufacturing by relying on skilled artisans and high-end craftsmanship rather than mass production. Despite rising costs, trade tariffs, and declining manufacturing employment, the company maintains its U.S. operations through premium pricing and domestic sourcing. The article highlights how the specialized skills of workers like Bernard Craddock and the unique supply of Sitka spruce from Alaska are essential to its operations. While President Donald Trump’s trade policies aim to boost domestic manufacturing, they have also created economic uncertainty, hindering investment and hiring. Steinway’s continued presence in New York reflects a broader lesson: sustainable manufacturing depends on quality, innovation, and the preservation of human expertise, rather than on scale or low-cost production.",
