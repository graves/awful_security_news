  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a fragile ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities on both sides using social media, red carpets, and public statements to advocate for peace or to criticize Israeli actions. Pro-Palestinian figures like Javier Bardem, Mark Ruffalo, and Cynthia Nixon have been vocal in calling for accountability and humanitarian aid, while pro-Israel figures such as Debra Messing accuse the movement of targeting Jews. A widespread boycott of Israeli film institutions, led by Film Workers for Palestine and supported by nearly 4,000 celebrities, has sparked backlash from studios like Paramount and Warner Bros., which oppose the boycott as censorship. The conflict reflects a broader cultural rift in Hollywood, where public opinion on global conflicts has become central to professional relationships and content production, leading to real-world consequences such as firings, agency drops, and industry-wide polarization.",
