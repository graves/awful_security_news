  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sparked significant backlash by posting on X a call for immigrants to 'remigrate' and use a self-deportation app, a move experts warn is laden with far-right connotations. Historically, the term 'remigrate' dates back to Nazi antisemitic policies like the Madagascar Plan, and is now central to the 'Great Replacement Theory'—a racist conspiracy claiming white populations are being replaced by immigrants. This ideology has inspired deadly terrorist attacks in Norway, Christchurch, El Paso, and Buffalo. In Europe, Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has implemented aggressive remigration policies, deporting asylum seekers to Albania and targeting even children born in Italy. Experts argue that the term is deliberately vague, allowing extremist groups to interpret it as a call for ethnic cleansing. The use of 'remigrate' in official U.S. policy signals a dangerous normalization of xenophobic and racist ideologies, raising concerns about both domestic and international implications of such language.",
