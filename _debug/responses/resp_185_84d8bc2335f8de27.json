  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest have been officially shelved by the White House, following a 'productive' call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which rendered a preparatory meeting unnecessary. The cancellation comes amid growing disagreement over Ukraine's territorial integrity, with Trump reportedly pushing for Ukrainian concessions in Donbas and Zelensky firmly rejecting such proposals. Russia insists on complete Ukrainian troop withdrawal and recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas, while Ukraine and European leaders advocate for a ceasefire frozen at the current front line. The only issue that appears to have prompted Russia’s diplomatic engagement — speculation over US supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine — is now seen as a significant breakthrough in diplomacy, though no substantive agreement has been reached.",
