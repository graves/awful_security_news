  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Colorado dentist, James Craig, was convicted of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes and other household items with arsenic, tetrahydrozoline, and potassium cyanide. The timeline began in late 2022 when Craig met women on seeking.com, including Karin Cain, and began planning a murder. On March 1–18, 2023, he conducted online searches for poisoning methods, ordered poisons through Amazon and a store in Aurora, and used his office computer to research lethal dosages and murder tactics. He poisoned Angela’s shakes with arsenic, later administered cyanide in a medication capsule, and used tetrahydrozoline from eyedrops to induce fatal symptoms. Staff at his dental office, including Caitlin Romero and Dr. Ryan Redfearn, became suspicious after observing the delivery of potassium cyanide and the progression of Angela’s symptoms, ultimately leading to a medical diagnosis of poisoning. Angela was pronounced brain dead on March 18, 2023. The case underscores the dangers of premeditated poisoning disguised as illness, the vulnerability of everyday products, and the importance of staff vigilance in detecting potential threats in high-access environments like dental offices.",
