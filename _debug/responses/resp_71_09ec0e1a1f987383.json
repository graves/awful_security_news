  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump refused to provide Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Ukraine believes could strike key Russian energy infrastructure. Trump instead urged both Ukraine and Russia to immediately cease hostilities and accept the current battle lines, calling for an end to the war. The meeting followed a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who argued that Tomahawk missiles would not impact the battlefield but could damage U.S.-Russia relations. Zelensky proposed a trade of Ukrainian drones for Tomahawks, and while he described the meeting as 'productive,' he declined to comment further due to U.S. concerns about escalation. Trump’s contradictory positions on territorial settlement—having previously supported land swaps and now suggesting Ukraine could reclaim all occupied territory—highlight the instability in U.S. policy toward ending the war. European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, emphasizing continued international support.",
