  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno state, farmers face escalating threats from Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), with targeted attacks on farmers more than doubling since 2024. Despite government initiatives like the Agro Rangers security unit—designed to protect farmers and promote agricultural reintegration—farmers report persistent fear, kidnappings, and killings, with many unable to return to their homes or farms. While officials claim progress, farmers and civil society groups argue that the security response is insufficient, and the rapid reintegration of displaced populations could expose them to greater risk. Over four million people face food insecurity, and militant groups are increasingly killing victims who cannot pay ransoms, indicating a shift toward more lethal tactics. The article highlights the urgent need for a sustained, comprehensive security and development strategy to restore peace and food security in conflict-affected rural communities.",
