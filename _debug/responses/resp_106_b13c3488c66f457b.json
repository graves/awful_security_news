  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under the Biden-Harris administration, reflects on her time in office and publicly announces her identification as an independent, citing deep internal disunity, political disloyalty, and failure to anticipate the 2024 election defeat as key reasons. She recounts witnessing President Biden’s health concerns during the 2024 debate, while maintaining confidence in his fitness. The article highlights how public expressions of doubt from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney contributed to a fractured Democratic Party. Jean-Pierre also addresses systemic bias against Black women in political roles, emphasizing their loyalty and the emotional impact of being seen and represented. She argues that Democrats failed to protect marginalized communities, including immigrants and LGBTQ individuals, and did not adequately respond to the rise of Project 2025, which promotes anti-DEI policies. Her decision to become an independent is framed not as a political defection but as a call for accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics, urging citizens to remain engaged and to resist silence.",
