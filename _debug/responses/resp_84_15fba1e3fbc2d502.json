    "A mysterious diffuse glow of gamma rays detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has puzzled scientists for over a decade.",
    "The glow matches the shape of the galactic bulge — a region rich in old stars — which previously favored the pulsar theory over dark matter.",
    "New computer simulations show that dark matter, specifically in a squashed, egg-shaped distribution due to galactic formation, could produce a glow matching the observed shape, supporting the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "The dark matter theory had been challenged by the spherical shape assumption in prior models — now, updated simulations suggest the dark matter distribution may be non-spherical, aligning better with Fermi telescope data.",
    "Scientists believe that if the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), scheduled to begin operations in 2027, detects gamma rays consistent with dark matter annihilation, it would represent a major breakthrough in confirming dark matter’s existence.",
    "WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) remain a leading dark matter candidate, and their annihilation could produce the observed gamma rays.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter, the growing body of indirect evidence — such as this simulation — keeps WIMPs as a viable explanation and fuels ongoing global experiments like the LZ Dark Matter Experiment.",
    "The debate between pulsars and dark matter continues, with experts like Joseph Silk suggesting a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, while others remain cautious."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are re-evaluating the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While earlier theories favored pulsars due to the glow’s bulge-like shape, new computer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues show that dark matter — specifically, a non-spherical, egg-shaped distribution resulting from galactic formation — could produce the same shape. This adds significant weight to the dark matter hypothesis, especially since the WIMP particle model predicts gamma-ray emissions from annihilation. Though no direct detection of dark matter has occurred, the new findings suggest a 50% chance it may explain the glow. A high-resolution gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to launch in 2027, will provide critical data to confirm or reject the dark matter link, potentially solving one of the most fundamental mysteries in physics.",
