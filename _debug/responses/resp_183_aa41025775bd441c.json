  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a 34-year-old man pardoned by former President Donald Trump after participating in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, has been arrested in Clinton, New York, for making a credible threat to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries during a public speech. Court filings reveal that Moynihan allegedly planned the attack and wrote in text messages that Jeffries must be 'eliminated' and that he would 'kill him for the future.' Moynihan, who was initially sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2023, has pleaded not guilty. The case underscores growing political violence in the U.S., with multiple attacks on lawmakers reported this year. Hakeem Jeffries praised law enforcement for protecting him, while critics question the wisdom of pardoning individuals involved in violent acts. Moynihan is currently held in Poughkeepsie and is scheduled to appear in court soon.",
