  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a large-scale Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration on October 19, 2025, a 155-millimeter artillery shell detonated prematurely over a section of Interstate 5 in California, striking two vehicles used in Vice President JD Vanceâ€™s protective detail. Although no injuries were reported, the incident raised serious safety concerns, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to close the highway due to extreme life risk. The California Highway Patrol confirmed that the shell failed to clear the highway and that shrapnel damaged vehicles, including a patrol car. The First Marine Expeditionary Force stated that the demonstration had undergone safety checks and that firing was suspended after the incident, with an investigation underway. Political tensions escalated as Vance and his team dismissed the danger, accusing Newsom of exaggeration and criticizing the government shutdown and military diversity initiatives, while Newsom accused the Trump administration of endangering lives for show. This event highlights a clash between military tradition and public safety, as well as deepening political divisions over the role of government, military conduct, and the handling of national celebrations.",
