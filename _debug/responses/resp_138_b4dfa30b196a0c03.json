  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenny Loggins is objecting to the use of his song 'Danger Zone' from the 'Top Gun' soundtrack in an AI-generated video showing President Donald Trump dumping excrement from a fighter jet during 'No Kings' protests. The video, posted on Truth Social, was created with the aim of satirizing or provoking political discourse, but Loggins claims he was not consulted and finds the use of his music offensive and divisive. The incident follows a pattern of Trump using AI-generated videos with copyrighted music—such as Blue Oyster Cult’s 'Don’t Fear the Reaper'—to target political figures and provoke reactions. Musicians like Adele and Bruce Springsteen have previously resisted Trump’s use of their music, signaling a broader concern about artistic rights and political appropriation. The White House responded with a 'Top Gun' image, referencing the film’s theme of speed and action, while the video remained online, underscoring tensions between free speech, satire, and intellectual property in the digital age.",
