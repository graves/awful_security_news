  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan has approved the over-the-counter sale of the emergency contraceptive pill Norlevo, marking a historic shift in reproductive health policy. The decision, driven by advocacy and public consultation, removes prescription and parental consent requirements, enabling women of all ages to access the medication without medical oversight. Although the pill will still require pharmacist guidance, its availability reflects a broader societal move toward greater reproductive autonomy, especially for younger women and survivors of sexual violence. The reform follows years of debate and a 2024 trial at 145 pharmacies, and comes amid Japan’s traditionally conservative cultural and gender norms. The pill, which contains levonorgestrel and is effective up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, aligns with global standards where such contraception is already available without prescription.",
