  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) upon arrival from Dubai at around 3:50 a.m. local time, breaking in two and crashing into the sea. The aircraft collided with an airport security patrol vehicle, killing two occupants. Four crew members were injured and taken to hospitals; no cargo was on board. The plane did not transmit distress signals. The airport suspended operations on the north runway, though other runways remain operational. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines under an Emirates flight number. Despite HKIA's status as one of the world’s busiest airports, such incidents are rare, with a notable past crash in 1999 involving China Airlines.",
