  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for prosecution. The operation, which marked at least the sixth such strike since early September, targeted a vessel reportedly loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics en route to the United States. Trump justified the military action by declaring an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, invoking the legal framework used after the 9/11 attacks. The operation killed at least 29 people, with one additional fatality reported compared to earlier estimates. The repatriation avoids legal ambiguity over the survivors' status in U.S. justice system.",
