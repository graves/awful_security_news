The storm is expected to pass near the island with strong winds and waves up to 1.2 meters high. This event occurs amid a broader pattern of natural disasters in the Philippines, including recent deadly earthquakes in Cebu and southern regions, and a prior typhoon (Ragasa) in September. Scientists link increasing storm intensity to climate change, and the country's frequent exposure to typhoons and earthquakes underscores its vulnerability as a disaster-prone nation. Local officials, including rescue official Gerry Rubio, are activating emergency plans, highlighting the importance of preparedness in disaster-prone areas.",
