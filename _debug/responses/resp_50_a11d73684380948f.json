  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The recent heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves used industrial tools to steal nine Napoleonic jewels during daytime hours, marks a worrying shift in museum crime — from stealing art for its cultural value to targeting portable, high-value artifacts for their raw materials. This trend, exemplified by the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden, reflects a move toward aggressive, 'grab-and-go' thefts using military-style precision and industrial equipment. Evidence such as discarded tools and the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie suggests a well-organized operation, possibly linked to organized crime such as the Remmo clan. A pattern of similar thefts in Paris, including the Natural History Museum and a museum in Limoges, raises concerns about a coordinated campaign. Experts warn that museums, due to their public access and security vulnerabilities, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to such attacks, threatening both national heritage and public trust. French authorities and Interpol are now investigating the incident, with the stolen artifacts added to Interpol’s stolen cultural heritage database.",
