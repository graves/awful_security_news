  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy involving the alleged use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former head of modern France has served time in prison. Sarkozy, who left office in 2012, maintains his innocence and criticizes the judicial process as politically motivated. He is currently held in the VIP wing of La Santé Prison in Paris, a high-security facility that has previously housed figures such as Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. His legal team is requesting early release, with a decision pending in two months. The case has significant implications for transparency in political financing and the treatment of former leaders in the French justice system.",
