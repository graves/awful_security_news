Al-Muhtadi reportedly coordinated an armed group to enter Israel and was active near Kfar Aza, where dozens were killed and many abducted. He falsely denied any terrorist involvement on his U.S. visa application in June 2024, which he submitted from Cairo, and entered the U.S. in September 2024. He lived in Tulsa and later Lafayette, where he was under FBI surveillance. The FBI claims he engaged in years of firearms training and supported Hamas through social media, and he is now facing charges of visa fraud and conspiracy to support a foreign terrorist organization. Al-Muhtadi was arrested in October 2025 and is scheduled to appear in federal court. The U.S. government, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Governor Jeff Landry, reaffirms its commitment to prosecuting those responsible for the attack, especially those who killed or kidnapped American citizens.",
