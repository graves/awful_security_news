  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Royal jewelry from French historical queens, including items from Queen Marie-Amélie, Queen Hortense, and Empress Eugenie, was stolen in a daring daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, with a total estimated value of $102 million. The thieves, masked and armed with a crane, broke into the Apollo Gallery in just seven minutes and escaped on motorcycles, with the crown of Empress Eugenie found outside the museum. The incident has sparked national outrage, prompting criticism of long-standing security deficiencies, including only a quarter of one wing being under video surveillance and cuts to security staff despite rising visitor numbers. The Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, had previously warned of these risks, and the case has intensified calls for urgent security reforms. A 24-year-old Chinese woman was detained in Barcelona for a previous heist at the Natural History Museum involving stolen gold, and a similar $7.6 million theft occurred in Limoges. French authorities and the Court of Auditors have documented repeated delays in security upgrades since 2019. The museum is expected to reopen after a two-day closure, and the theft has drawn both public and political attention to the fragile state of cultural heritage security in France.",
