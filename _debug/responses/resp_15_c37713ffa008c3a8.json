  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife Angela Craig, who died in March 2023 after consuming protein shakes laced with arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. The poisoning was carefully planned over several weeks, beginning with Craig’s online research into poisons, including searches for lethal dosages and methods to disguise murder as a heart attack. He ordered toxic substances such as arsenic and cyanide, and used a fake email account to conduct research. The crimes were carried out through a combination of deception, false medical justifications, and the use of everyday products like protein shakes and eyedrops. A key turning point came when office staff, including Caitlin Romero and Dr. Ryan Redfearn, discovered the cyanide delivery and raised concerns, leading to the investigation. The case is a disturbing example of how premeditated domestic violence can be disguised as medical illness and highlights the risks of unchecked online research and suspicious financial activity in personal relationships.",
