  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump’s response to the widespread 'No Kings' protests — including AI-generated memes depicting him as a king — reveals a growing belief in unchecked executive power, undermining democratic norms. The article highlights how Trump's actions, such as pardoning George Santos, targeting political rivals like James Comey and Letitia James, authorizing unilateral military strikes in the Caribbean and Venezuela, and dismissing public dissent, reflect an authoritarian trend. These actions, combined with dismissive remarks from White House officials, provoke a national protest movement with millions participating across 50 states, signaling deep public concern about the erosion of constitutional governance. Critics argue that such behavior not only violates democratic principles but also risks escalating political and social fractures, especially amid a government shutdown and growing resistance from institutions and citizens alike. The article ultimately concludes that Trump’s actions are proving the protesters' point: that democracy is under threat and that public dissent is essential to preserving constitutional order.",
