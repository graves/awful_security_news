  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, asserting that the prosecution is the result of a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unconstitutional due to circumventing the Senate’s confirmation requirement. His legal team argues that Trump’s public attacks on Comey, as well as the selective prosecution of only Comey despite other officials being uncharged, demonstrate retaliatory intent and abuse of power. They also draw a parallel to a previous case where Trump’s own indictment was dismissed for similar constitutional violations, suggesting that Halligan’s appointment lacked legal authority. These claims are part of a broader constitutional and political debate over executive overreach, retaliation for protected speech, and the integrity of the justice system in politically charged environments.",
