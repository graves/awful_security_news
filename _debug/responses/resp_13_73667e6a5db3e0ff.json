  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have collapsed, with officials confirming no immediate plans for a meeting. This follows a phone call where Trump suggested a summit within two weeks, but subsequent diplomatic efforts — including a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov — failed to yield progress due to divergent positions on ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin maintains that no date was set, so a summit cannot be postponed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blames the US decision not to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles for Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest. The Trump administration now sees no need for a high-level meeting between Rubio and Lavrov, citing Lavrov’s limited influence on actual policy decisions. While a Trump-Putin summit remains a possibility in the future, current efforts are on hold, with potential future meetings possibly occurring at a side event of an ASEAN summit in Malaysia. The White House continues to emphasize Trump’s commitment to achieving peace in Ukraine.",
