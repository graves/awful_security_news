    "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 10% to 15% of all new diagnoses in the U.S., with about 47,500 cases diagnosed annually.",
    "ILC is more difficult to detect via routine mammograms because it grows in thin strands that don't distort breast tissue, often appearing as normal tissue and evading detection.",
    "The rate of ILC has increased more than three times faster than all other breast cancers combined, rising by about 2.8% per year from 2012 to 2021.",
    "The steepest rise in ILC cases has been observed among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, with a 4.4% annual increase.",
    "The median age of diagnosis is 66, with about 70% of new ILC cases diagnosed in women aged 60 and older.",
    "ILC is often hormone receptor-positive, meaning it grows in response to estrogen or progesterone, making hormonal therapy a key treatment option.",
    "Treatment options include surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy, with targeted drugs used for advanced disease, though ILC may be more resistant and carry a poorer prognosis once spread occurs.",
    "Lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol use, and changes in childbearing patterns may contribute to rising ILC rates due to hormonal shifts.",
    "Improved diagnostic awareness and better classification may also explain part of the rise, as some ILC cases were previously misclassified as ductal cancers.",
    "Longer post-menopausal life expectancy may increase the likelihood of developing ILC due to prolonged hormone exposure.",
    "Women can reduce risk through lifestyle changes: quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining healthy weight, staying active, and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.",
    "Early detection is crucial; women should be aware of changes like thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, or fullness and seek medical evaluation if changes occur."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), the second most common type of breast cancer in the U.S., has increased in incidence at more than three times the rate of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade. From 2012 to 2021, ILC rates rose by 2.8% annually, while other breast cancers increased by 0.8% per year. ILC is particularly difficult to detect via routine mammograms because it grows in thin, diffuse strands that resemble normal breast tissue, often going unnoticed. The steepest increases were seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, with a 4.4% annual rise, and most diagnoses occur in women aged 60 and older. The rise is linked to changing hormonal patterns, rising obesity and alcohol use, and longer post-menopausal lifespans. Diagnosis may also be improving due to better recognition and classification. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy, though ILC may have a poorer prognosis in advanced stages and may be more resistant to therapy. Prevention strategies include healthy lifestyle choices such as limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying physically active, along with regular screening and awareness of breast changes.",
