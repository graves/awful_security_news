  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a developing legal dispute, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors allege that former FBI Director James Comey used his lead defense attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, to improperly disseminate classified information in 2017, raising serious ethical concerns about Fitzgerald’s ability to represent Comey. The prosecutors claim that communications between Comey and Fitzgerald contain evidence of such disclosures, while Fitzgerald counters that the memos in question were unclassified at the time of sharing and that no classified material was ever disclosed. He emphasizes that the government later upclassified the memos, which does not negate their initial unclassified status. Comey’s attorneys have dismissed the allegations as 'provably false,' and legal experts like Elie Honig highlight the inherent conflict of interest when a lawyer is both a witness and a defense counsel. The case underscores the complex ethical boundaries in U.S. legal representation, particularly in high-profile political controversies.",
