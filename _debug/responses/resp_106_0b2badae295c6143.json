  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Missouri, a grassroots movement led by People Not Politicians Missouri is challenging the state's newly gerrymandered congressional map, which was signed into law by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe and targets the district of longtime Democrat Emanuel Cleaver II. The group, with over 100,000 signatures, is seeking a 2026 referendum to allow voters to decide whether to keep or reject the map. Critics, including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, argue that such a referendum violates constitutional principles, while supporters, including progressive candidate Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan and volunteers like Leann Villaluz, emphasize that redistricting dilutes representation and undermines fair governance. Despite bipartisan opposition within the Missouri legislature—where 15 Republicans, including Speaker Jon Patterson and Bill Allen, oppose the map—Republican lawmakers like Michael Davis support it as a means to send a conservative message to Congress. The movement is gaining traction, with public support demonstrated at events like a Chappell Roan concert, and is backed by the Democratic National Committee. The broader context includes a national Republican effort, initiated by President Donald Trump, to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms, with Missouri and Texas being among the first states to act.",
