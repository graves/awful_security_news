  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pickleball, a rapidly growing sport in the U.S. with nearly 20 million participants, is linked to a significant rise in eye injuries—up by 405 cases annually from 2021 to 2024. The study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that 70% of injuries occur in adults aged 50 or older, with causes including being struck by the ball, paddle, or falling due to the game’s fast pace and small court. Experts such as Dr. Corey Lacher and Dr. Daniel Henick emphasize that standardized eye protection guidelines—especially those meeting ASTM F3164 and made from shatter-resistant polycarbonate—could prevent up to 90% of injuries. Despite strong recommendations, many players remain unaware of the risks, and the lack of awareness and user-friendly options remain barriers to adoption. USA Pickleball has not responded to calls for policy changes, highlighting a critical gap in safety infrastructure for the sport.",
