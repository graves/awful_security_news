  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The construction of a $250 million new White House ballroom, set to host up to 999 guests, has raised serious ethical concerns about corporate and individual donations, with the White House claiming the project will not cost taxpayers. While YouTube has committed $22 million as part of a legal settlement, a list of other donors remains undisclosed. A dinner on 15 October brought together executives from major companies including Blackstone, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, as well as owners of NFL franchises. Critics, including former ethics lawyer Richard Painter, warn this could amount to a 'pay-to-play' scheme, where access to the White House is exchanged for financial support. The White House argues the ballroom will save costs by replacing expensive tent events and will be used by future administrations. However, the potential for political influence and lack of transparency continue to fuel public debate.",
