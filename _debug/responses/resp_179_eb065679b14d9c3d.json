  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the logistical and political challenges of a proposed summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, scheduled within the next two weeks in Budapest, Hungary. Despite the EU’s ban on Russian aircraft and asset freezes, the summit is being considered as a potential path toward a lasting peace in Ukraine. Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, supports the meeting due to its strong political ties with both Putin and Trump. However, Putin’s travel to Budapest would require special permission to fly over EU airspace, possibly via Serbia, Bulgaria, or Romania—each of which would need individual national consent. The EU and NATO have not formally blocked the meeting, and the summit is seen as a diplomatic alternative to ongoing war efforts. Nevertheless, the route remains complex due to airspace restrictions, security concerns, and the broader geopolitical tensions stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and international legal actions such as those by the ICC.",
