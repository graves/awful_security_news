  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has launched a new, more sophisticated phase of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, targeting power stations like Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 and natural gas delivery facilities with hundreds of modified drones and missiles. The October 10, 2025 strike caused extensive damage, leaving the city without power and water for much of the day and disrupting subway operations. Russian modifications to missiles and drones have drastically reduced interception success, while corruption in Ukraine’s anti-drone spending has undermined infrastructure protection. Experts and officials warn that the destruction is so severe that restoration may not be possible, leading to a potentially harsh winter. Civilians are preparing by stockpiling fuel, power banks, and alternative heating sources, and some businesses have shifted to natural gas. This marks a strategic shift in Russian warfare aimed at leaving Ukrainian civilians defenseless during the winter months.",
