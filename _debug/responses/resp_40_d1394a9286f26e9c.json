  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health providers and veterans are raising alarm over a policy shift that limits long-term one-on-one therapy sessions—particularly under the current administration led by VA Secretary Doug Collins. Veterans like Michael, a combat veteran with PTSD, report being abruptly cut off from therapy, which they say feels like abandonment. Providers say they are being pressured to end therapy at 8–12 sessions, even for chronic conditions like PTSD, without clinical input or patient agreement. Some have faced disciplinary action for resisting these limits. The VA denies that veterans are being denied care, asserting that follow-on care is planned collaboratively with patients. However, critics—including former VA staff and the American Psychological Association—argue that such limits are clinically inappropriate, especially for conditions requiring lifelong treatment. Veterans express fear that they will be left to manage severe mental health issues without support, and some have resigned due to frustration. The policy shift, which intensified since early 2025, has led to staff shortages and erosion of trust between veterans and mental health providers.",
