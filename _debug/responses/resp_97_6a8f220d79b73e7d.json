  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing guns, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm and narcotics linked to habitual marijuana use. The Trump administration is defending the law, asserting that habitual drug users with firearms pose significant risks to public safety, especially during impaired encounters with law enforcement. However, lower courts, including the 5th U.S. Circuit, have ruled that such a prohibition lacks historical precedent and should not apply to habitual users. The case also draws attention due to Hunter Biden’s prior conviction under the same law and subsequent pardon, adding political sensitivity. The Supreme Court’s decision—expected by end of June 2026—will determine whether the Second Amendment protects individuals who use drugs regularly from firearm ownership, potentially reshaping national gun policy and public safety law.",
