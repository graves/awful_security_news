Fitzgerald counters that the memos shared with his team were unclassified at the time and that no classified data was released. The dispute centers on the ethical implications of a defense lawyer being involved in the very information being contested, with experts noting that such a situation could violate legal principles that prohibit a person from being both a witness and a counsel. The case highlights tensions over transparency, national security, and the integrity of legal representation in high-profile political investigations.",
