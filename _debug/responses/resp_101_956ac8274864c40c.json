  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man who participated in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot and was pardoned by President Trump is now being prosecuted for allegedly threatening to kill U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Christopher Moynihan, 34, was arrested in October 2025 after FBI intelligence revealed that he sent texts threatening to kill Jeffries, including the message 'I will kill him for the future.' Despite being pardoned in 2021, Moynihan was previously sentenced in 2023 to 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release. His arrest has reignited national debate over the safety risks of blanket pardons, especially given that many pardoned individuals have prior violent convictions. The case is part of a broader trend, with Capitol Police reporting over 14,000 threat assessments in 2025, a significant increase from previous years, and media outlets like NPR highlighting the dangerous behavior of pardoned rioters, including the fatal case of Matthew Huttle.",
