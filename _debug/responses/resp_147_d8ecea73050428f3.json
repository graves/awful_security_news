  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), which would have introduced a global carbon tax on shipping emissions, by at least 12 months. This decision followed a public threat by U.S. President Donald Trump, who labeled the plan a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' and threatened sanctions on countries supporting it. The vote, which passed 57-49 in favor of delay, saw key allies like China, the EU, and Britain maintain support, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or withdrew support. The NZF, if adopted, would have charged ships $380 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent emissions and aimed to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. Critics, including UN officials and the International Chamber of Shipping, argue that the delay undermines global climate goals and industry readiness for decarbonization, especially as climate change already disrupts ocean systems and shipping safety.",
