  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify both their social behavior and nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. Infected ants self-isolate, while healthy ants—particularly nurses—distance themselves from foragers, demonstrating a form of proactive social distancing. In addition, when exposed to the fungus, ants build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with wider entrances and longer travel routes, which reduce disease transmission. These structural changes enhance colony resilience by limiting pathogen spread. The research, led by behavioral ecologist Nathalie Stroeymeyt and systems biologist Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, is the first to demonstrate a non-human social species actively altering its physical environment in response to disease threats. Experts like Sarah Kocher at Princeton believe these ant strategies could inspire human-designed public spaces to incorporate 'architectural immunity'—using space and layout to protect vulnerable populations from disease outbreaks.",
