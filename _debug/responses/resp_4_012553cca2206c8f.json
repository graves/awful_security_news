  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a fragile ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities actively and publicly expressing opposing views. Pro-Palestinian activists, such as Javier Bardem, Mark Ruffalo, and Cynthia Nixon, advocate for accountability of Israeli institutions and push for humanitarian relief and a permanent ceasefire. Meanwhile, pro-Israel voices like Debra Messing criticize the silence and perceived bias of the 'Free Palestine' movement, suggesting that activism is politically motivated. A widespread boycott of Israeli film institutions, led by Film Workers for Palestine, has sparked a major rift between studios under pro-Israel leadership (like Paramount and Warner Bros.) and artists who see the boycott as a necessary stand against systemic complicity in Palestinian suffering. The article highlights how Hollywood—usually a unifying cultural force—has become a battleground of political ideology, with social media, red carpets, and public statements intensifying the conflict. The executions of Palestinians in Gaza and threats from President Donald Trump further complicate the ceasefire, raising concerns about its sustainability. Even as a peace agreement is in place, the underlying tensions remain unresolved, with both sides accusing each other of hypocrisy and inaction.",
