  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Instagram, owned by Meta, is introducing new parental controls that allow parents to block teens' access to AI chat features, either entirely or with specific character restrictions. These controls will help parents monitor and manage the topics teens discuss with AI characters, especially those related to mental health. The move follows growing public and legal scrutiny over AI platforms, including Meta and OpenAI, where concerns have been raised about teens forming emotional attachments to AI, leading to self-harm and suicide. Lawsuits involving Character.AI and ChatGPT, including one concerning 16-year-old Adam Raine, have intensified pressure on tech companies to implement safeguards. Meta claims its AI characters are designed not to engage in conversations about self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating, and teens are limited to educational and sports-related AI interactions. This update aligns with broader industry efforts, such as OpenAI’s own parental controls, to protect minors from harmful content and emotional risks posed by AI technology.",
