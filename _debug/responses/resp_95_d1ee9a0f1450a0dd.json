  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective weapon used in conflicts across Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the Balkans, remains a key strategic option for Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. Despite its destructive power, Ukraine currently lacks the necessary ground-launch system (such as the Typhon) and has not received any Tomahawks due to U.S. policy constraints and Russia’s strong warnings about escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for their delivery to target key Russian infrastructure like the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, arguing they would strengthen Ukraine’s military position and pressure Russia into negotiations. However, the Kremlin views the supply of such missiles as a hostile act capable of threatening global security, particularly due to the Tomahawk’s potential nuclear capability. Meanwhile, Ukraine's own Flamingo missile program is underdeveloped, and the US, under former President Donald Trump, has stated it has few Tomahawks available for Ukraine. Ultimately, while the Tomahawk is a powerful tool, its delivery is currently blocked, and Ukraine remains reliant on air defenses and other systems to counter Russia's growing drone and missile attacks.",
