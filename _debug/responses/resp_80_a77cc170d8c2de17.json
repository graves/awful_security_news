  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism for its controversial military strikes in the Caribbean, targeting alleged drug-carrying submarines. After a failed strike that left two survivors—Colombian and Ecuadorian nationals—unharmed, the administration chose to release them to their home countries rather than detain or prosecute them. This decision undermines the administration’s claims that these individuals are 'narco-terrorists' posing an imminent threat to American lives, as it contradicts the logic of military engagement. Experts question the evidence supporting the claims of fentanyl trafficking and mass killing threats, noting that the region is not typically used for such operations. The lack of transparency, absence of public evidence, and legal ambiguity surrounding the operations raise serious concerns about the administration’s use of executive power without congressional authorization. The release of the survivors appears to be a strategic move to avoid legal accountability, including potential habeas corpus challenges. This action has drawn skepticism from international leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts such as Jack Goldsmith, who highlight the contradiction between the administration’s rhetoric and its actions. Growing bipartisan concern in Congress—such as from Senator Todd Young—is beginning to pressure lawmakers to investigate the legality and transparency of the operations, though political dynamics and ongoing legislative priorities have so far limited action.",
