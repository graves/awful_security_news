  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s interim president, Jose Jeri, has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital, Lima, amid sustained protests driven by youth-led movements demanding accountability for corruption and organized crime. The emergency allows the military to patrol streets and suspends constitutional rights like freedom of assembly. This comes after Dina Boluarte was removed from office in October 2025 due to her failure to address a surge in crime, including 18,000 extortion cases and 1,690 homicides between January and September 2025. The situation intensified when protests turned violent on October 22, resulting in one death and 100 injuries. Previous attempts by Boluarte to manage the crisis through emergency measures in March 2025 failed to reduce crime, indicating a recurring challenge in government response. Jeri has affirmed he will not resign despite pressure, signaling a continuation of the crisis and deepening public discontent.",
