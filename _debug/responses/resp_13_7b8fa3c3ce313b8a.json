  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plan for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin has stalled, with the White House now confirming no immediate plans for a meeting. This follows a previous phone call between Trump and Putin that suggested a meeting within two weeks, but diplomatic progress stalled after a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, which revealed divergent positions on ending the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has stated that a summit cannot be postponed without a scheduled date, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia's reduced interest in diplomacy stems from the US withholding long-range missiles. Despite the setback, the US maintains that Trump remains committed to peace in Ukraine, and there remains a possibility for future talks between Rubio and Lavrov at a regional forum like ASEAN’s upcoming summit in Malaysia.",
