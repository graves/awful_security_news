  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in two decades, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in the October 2025 presidential runoff, ending decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. In a bold shift, Paz pledged to rebuild U.S. relations, especially with the Trump administration, and reject an IMF bailout, while committing to secure fuel imports to address a severe shortage caused by a lack of U.S. dollars and soaring inflation. His campaign, energized by former police officer Edman Lara’s social media success and populist appeal, attracted widespread support from rural and working-class voters. Despite winning, protests erupted over allegations of fraud, echoing past political tensions, including the disputed 2019 election of Evo Morales. Paz faces a difficult task of balancing economic reforms—such as targeted fuel subsidies and constitutional changes—with maintaining trust among Bolivia’s Indigenous majority and former MAS supporters. His government will begin implementing reforms on November 8, marking a pivotal moment in Bolivia’s political and economic trajectory.",
