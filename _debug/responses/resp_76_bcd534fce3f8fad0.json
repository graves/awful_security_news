  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court is reviewing the legitimacy of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed the standard Senate confirmation process. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, was initially appointed as interim US attorney and later designated as special attorney under delegation authority. The Department of Justice argues that such delegation is a recognized and lawful practice, citing the appointment of 16 US attorneys recently confirmed and asserting that no expiration date exists for delegated authority. However, critics, including DOJ counsel Abbe Lowell, claim that delegating full US attorney powers—such as overseeing investigations and managing personnel—is unprecedented and unlawful, calling it a 'gerry-rigged' workaround. The case has prompted similar legal challenges in Nevada and California, and the dispute reflects broader tensions over executive power, congressional obstruction, and the proper procedures for filling key federal positions. Habba has attributed the delay in nominations to congressional political obstruction and emphasized the need for the executive branch to fulfill its mandate after a presidential transition.",
