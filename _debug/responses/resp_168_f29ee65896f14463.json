  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a urgent call to action for global improvement of early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. The report reveals that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without such systems, and that 90% of weather-related fatalities over the past 50 years occurred in developing nations. Despite progress—such as a rise in multi-hazard warning systems from 52 to 108 countries—the situation remains dire, especially in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Real-world examples, including the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a glacier collapse predicted in May 2025, illustrate the life-saving potential of timely alerts. As extreme weather events like floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, have intensified in 2025, the WMO emphasizes that early warning systems are not just about alerts, but about enabling communities to take early, protective action.",
