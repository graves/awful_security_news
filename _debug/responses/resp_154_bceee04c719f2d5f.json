  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of the ongoing war, Russian drone attacks struck Ukraine's Chernihiv region on October 21, 2025, killing at least four civilians and injuring 10 others, including a child, in the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi. The attacks also destroyed power and water infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity and forcing residents to rely on emergency ‘invincibility points’ for heat and power. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately targeting energy facilities and using drones to prevent repairs, aiming to terrorize civilians during winter. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as acts of murder and terror. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine to strike Russian territory, though no agreement was reached. A planned meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was canceled, with both sides stating no immediate plans. European leaders and Ukraine rejected any territorial concessions, affirming the principle that international borders must not be altered by force.",
