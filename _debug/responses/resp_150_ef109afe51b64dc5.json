  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza are still far below the daily target of 2,000 tonnes, with only two border crossings—Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara—currently open. Despite an increase in distribution points from five to 26, the WFP says access to northern Gaza remains severely limited due to the closure of the Rafah crossing and the lack of access to Salah al-Din Street. The US-brokered ceasefire, supported by Donald Trump’s 20-point plan, is crucial to sustaining aid, but humanitarian access depends on Hamas fulfilling its promise to return the bodies of deceased captives. As of now, only 750 metric tonnes of food enter Gaza daily, and residents are storing supplies due to fear of future disruptions, with current supplies sufficient for half a million people for two weeks.",
