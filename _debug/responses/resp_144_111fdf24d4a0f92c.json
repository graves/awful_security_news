  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 under the current warming trajectory of 2.6°C, a significant reduction from the 114-day increase projected under a pre-Paris warming path of 4°C. Although the Paris Agreement has helped avert the worst-case scenario, the world still faces a dangerous and growing number of extreme heat days. The study reveals a stark global inequality in climate impacts, with small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa facing massive spikes in heat—up to 149 extra days per year—despite emitting just 1% of global greenhouse gases. In contrast, the top polluters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this imbalance could deepen global disparities and fuel geopolitical instability, and that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by the increasing frequency of deadly heatwaves.",
