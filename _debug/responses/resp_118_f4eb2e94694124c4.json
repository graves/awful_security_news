  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against pro-Trump Republican Jack Ciattarelli in a closely contested race that is unusual for a historically blue state. Despite a 3-to-2 Democratic voter registration edge, the race is seen as politically purple due to New Jersey’s history of alternating party control. National figures like President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama have endorsed the candidates, with Trump backing Ciattarelli and Obama supporting Sherrill. The campaign has become highly personal, with accusations including Sherrill being barred from her naval academy graduation in 1994 and claims that Ciattarelli's former company downplayed opioid risks, leading to a defamation threat. Voter concerns center on affordability, including a 17–20% surge in electricity bills and rising property taxes. Experts like Ben Dworkin note that this race may mark the first time since the 1960s that a single party wins three consecutive gubernatorial terms. Ultimately, the outcome hinges on which candidate presents the more compelling message about cost of living and economic stability.",
