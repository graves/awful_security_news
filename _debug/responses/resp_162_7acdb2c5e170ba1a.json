  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's push to remove aluminium from vaccines, which has been cited as a policy initiative rooted in anti-vaccine sentiment. Despite no scientific evidence supporting harm from aluminium adjuvants—backed by decades of global use and studies showing no link to autism or asthma—the administration has advanced policies such as reducing vaccine access, scaling back recommendations, and forming a new CDC working group to assess aluminium safety. Experts including the CDC, FDA, and medical professionals emphasize that aluminium is safe, effective, and critical for vaccine efficacy, warning that removing it would lead to increased disease outbreaks and undermine public health. Scientific studies, including a 2025 review, find no evidence of increased asthma risk or causation of autism, and the WHO has discredited the earlier 2011 study linking aluminium to autism as flawed.",
