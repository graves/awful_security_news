  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Republican-controlled states, including North Carolina, are actively redrawing congressional maps to gain additional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In North Carolina, the new map targets Don Davis’s district to shift it toward Republican favor, with Republican leaders like Ralph Hise citing President Donald Trump’s direct calls and national political strategy as motivation. Trump has publicly endorsed the effort, calling it a victory for his 'America First' agenda. Democrats condemn the maps as a political arms race, accusing Republicans of starting the conflict and engaging in deceptive practices. Other states like Texas, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah are also involved in similar redistricting battles, with some facing legal challenges or voter referenda. The broader trend reflects a national effort by Republicans to consolidate political power, while Democrats respond with legal, political, and grassroots initiatives to protect competitive districts and ensure fair representation.",
