DNA tests confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and causing or risking a catastrophe. Evidence including King’s cellphone location data and surveillance footage of the stolen black Hyundai Accent—seen near the crime scene and later reported on fire—links him to the case. Prosecutors indicate that homicide charges are under consideration and that others may be involved. The case has drawn significant public attention due to the tragic nature of Scott’s disappearance and the severity of the charges against King.",
