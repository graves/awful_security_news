The identification of these bodies has intensified public and political pressure, especially as only 16 of the 28 total bodies remain unreturned.

Israel maintains that Hamas knows the locations of some missing bodies and is using them as leverage. Protests have erupted in Israel, and the Rafah crossing remains closed, hindering aid access. The ceasefire, which entered its second week, is under significant strain due to ongoing strikes, delayed body returns, and allegations of violations by both sides.",
