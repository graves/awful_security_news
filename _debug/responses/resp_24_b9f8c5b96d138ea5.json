  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court decision that had blocked the move. However, the ruling does not allow immediate deployment due to an outstanding second temporary restraining order. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is controversial, with dissenting judge Susan Graber arguing it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The administration claims the protests near an ICE facility are violent and uncontrollable, justifying troop deployment under emergency powers. This action is part of a broader effort to federalize National Guard forces in cities like Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco, each facing legal challenges and public backlash. Critics, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, argue that such actions violate constitutional principles, endanger civil liberties, and overstep state and local authority. The Senate has called for an inquiry into the cumulative impact of these deployments. As the legal battle continues, a request for an en banc review has been made by both state and federal parties, with a deadline set for October 22, 2025, to decide whether the ruling should be reconsidered.",
