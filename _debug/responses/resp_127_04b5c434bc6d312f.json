  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s proposal to reduce U.S. beef prices by importing more meat from Argentina is facing significant criticism from American ranchers and agricultural experts. Despite Argentina contributing only about 2% of U.S. beef imports, experts like Glynn Tonsor argue that even doubling imports would not meaningfully lower prices due to strong domestic demand and a small herd size since 1961. Ranchers, including members of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and United Stockgrowers of America, oppose the plan, saying it contradicts the administration's stated goal of supporting domestic production and undermining their recent profitable years. The policy creates economic uncertainty, which could deter investment in cattle farming. While Argentine producers welcome new U.S. demand, economists warn that over-reliance on exports could hurt their own domestic markets. The administration, through Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Senator John Hoeven, remains committed to supporting ranchers and may revise the plan, though ranchers remain skeptical and view the proposal as politically motivated.",
