  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew’s lease agreement for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, allows him to live in the 30-room property without paying annual rent, as he made large upfront payments totaling around £8 million—covering renovations and buying out future rent obligations. The deal, which includes clauses for property upkeep and restrictions like no helicopters or gambling, was initially seen as a financially sound arrangement for the Crown Estate, avoiding public spending on a property that couldn’t be commercially rented. However, ongoing controversy stemming from his links to Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual abuse involving Virginia Giuffre has intensified public scrutiny over his lifestyle and financial responsibility. The lease, set to end in 2078, includes provisions for his ex-wife and daughters to continue living there, and while the National Audit Office confirmed it provided 'value for money', critics argue that taxpayers are being asked to subsidize a royal lifestyle that contradicts principles of accountability and fair contribution. Public figures, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, have called for Prince Andrew to live privately and repay any benefits he has received.",
