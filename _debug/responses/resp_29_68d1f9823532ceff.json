  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is pressing federal officials, particularly from CBP and ICE, over their response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 arrests. The judge expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras on all agents during protests, citing incidents where demonstrators, including a pastor, were attacked with tear gas and pepper balls without warning. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued them and face delays in procurement. ICE agents are trained on use of force and handling journalists, and incidents are reviewed internally. The federal leadership structure is described as unstable, with frequent personnel changes. The Trump administration has denied media reports of tear gas use, while Judge Ellis plans to deposed key officials, including former ICE head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino, to obtain direct testimony on field operations.",
