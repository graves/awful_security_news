  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox have been confirmed in California — one in Long Beach and one in Los Angeles County — marking the first instances of local transmission of this variant in the U.S. Unlike earlier cases, which were among international travelers, these cases suggest potential domestic spread. Health officials emphasize that the risk to the public remains low, and no confirmed chain of transmission has been identified. Close contacts have been vaccinated, and investigations are ongoing. The cases are significant due to their link to a virus previously seen in Africa, and due to concerns that weakened public health infrastructure from a federal shutdown may delay effective responses. Experts warn that the emergence of locally transmitted clade I mpox raises public health concerns, especially given its broader transmission patterns compared to the 2022 clade II outbreak.",
