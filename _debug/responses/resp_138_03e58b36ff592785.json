  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A recent AP-NORC poll reveals growing public concern about job stability and rising living costs under President Donald Trump, with 47% of U.S. adults expressing low confidence in their ability to find a good job. Inflation in groceries, housing, health care, and electricity persists, with 36% of adults citing electricity costs as a major financial stressor. The article highlights how Trump’s economic policies, such as tariffs and cuts to renewable energy funding, have contributed to inflation and public skepticism. Despite strong economic indicators like low unemployment, public trust in the economy remains low, with 68% calling it 'poor' and only 12% saying they are 'getting ahead.' Individual accounts from people like Linda Weavil and Kevin Halsey illustrate how inflation affects everyday life. This economic uncertainty poses a significant challenge to Republican credibility, especially as the party faces upcoming gubernatorial races and future elections where economic performance will be a key issue.",
