  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears during a routine run in Myoko, Japan. The attack resulted in severe injuries, including a bitten-off piece of his arm and claw punctures to his leg, requiring three surgeries. This incident occurred amid a surge in bear attacks across Japan — over 100 injuries and seven deaths in 2025 — attributed to climate change disrupting bears' traditional food sources and forcing them into human habitats. The Japanese government has responded by announcing tougher measures to control bear populations. Halloran, though traumatized and recovering physically and mentally, remains determined to return to running in nature, highlighting both the personal risks and the broader societal challenge of human-wildlife conflict in a changing climate.",
