  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a significant development, a Lebanese court has ordered the release of Hannibal Gaddafi, the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, on a $11 million bail after nearly a decade of pre-trial detention. The detention stems from allegations that he withheld information about the 1978 disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia leader Musa al-Sadr during a visit to Libya. Despite claims from his lawyer Laurent Bayon that the bail is unreasonable and unfeasible due to international sanctions and financial constraints, the decision has drawn criticism and protests from the al-Sadr family, who emphasize their focus on uncovering the truth about al-Sadr’s fate. Libyan authorities have previously urged Lebanon to release Gaddafi due to his health and the potential for new information about the disappearance. Human Rights Watch has also criticized the detention as unjust. The case remains a highly sensitive political and historical issue, reflecting deep-rooted tensions between Lebanon and Libya over unresolved state secrets and national security concerns.",
