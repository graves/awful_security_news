  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fatal crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet CARRIS’s operational specifications and that maintenance records were falsified, with tasks marked as completed despite non-compliance. Eyewitnesses described the derailment as chaotic, with one man named Bruno recounting the car's violent motion and the sudden appearance of smoke and screams. While the interim report identifies serious failures in cable integrity, maintenance, and braking systems, authorities stress that the findings are preliminary and a final report will be released next year.",
