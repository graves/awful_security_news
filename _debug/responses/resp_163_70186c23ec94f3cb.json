  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT in Virginia due to a flawed software update to DynamoDB’s API disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS), causing a chain reaction that brought down 113 services, including major apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, financial platforms like Venmo, and media organizations such as The New York Times. The outage lasted until 10:11 GMT and affected not only AWS-dependent services but also smart home devices like Ring and Alexa. Experts confirmed the incident stemmed from human error, not a cyberattack, and emphasized that despite the scale of disruption, AWS’s market dominance and rapid recovery mechanisms ensure minimal long-term impact. This incident underscores the critical role cloud infrastructure plays in modern digital life and the vulnerability of a global internet that relies on a few large tech providers.",
