The compact, first sent to nine institutions on October 1, 2025, was designed to promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' under federal oversight, with enforcement via annual anonymous polls. While the White House claims the agreement would provide competitive advantages including grants and federal partnerships, universities argue it undermines academic freedom and institutional sovereignty. The rejections reflect a broader national tension between federal governance and academic independence, with institutions emphasizing their mission-driven governance and commitment to free inquiry. Meanwhile, several schools—including Vanderbilt, Arizona State, and the University of Kansas—are still reviewing the proposal, while the University of Texas at Austin has expressed openness to dialogue.",
