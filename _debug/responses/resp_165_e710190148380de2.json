  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing better than expected, with US Vice President JD Vance affirming that the truce can hold. However, tensions persist due to a Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli retaliation and renewed violence. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of the 28 deceased hostages, but Israel insists on full compliance before advancing negotiations. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pushing for talks on the second phase of the 20-point peace plan, which includes an interim Palestinian government, international stabilisation force, troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. Despite progress, concerns remain that Israel may abandon the ceasefire, and aid delivery remains severely constrained due to only two functional crossings (Kerem Shalom and Kissufim), with the northern region facing extreme shortages. The UN's World Food Programme has delivered over 6,700 tonnes of food, but logistical challenges and fears of future blockades have led to widespread rationing and anxiety among Gaza’s population.",
