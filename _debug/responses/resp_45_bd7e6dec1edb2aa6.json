  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, demanding land give-ups—particularly in the strategically vital Donbas region—during a working lunch. While Trump later supported a ceasefire along current battle lines, European officials described the meeting as tense and marked by disagreement over the war’s future. Trump, influenced by his prior truce with Hamas in Gaza, emphasized the need to end the conflict quickly and reduce civilian casualties, citing the 'realities of where the conflict stands.' A Russian proposal involving Ukraine surrendering eastern Donbas in exchange for Russian-held southern regions was cited as a significant territorial demand. Zelensky criticized the demands but acknowledged the meeting was constructive, with both leaders agreeing on a path forward. The article highlights a shift in Trump’s approach—from claiming Ukraine could regain all lost territory to advocating a ceasefire at current frontlines—raising concerns about Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term security.",
