    "Scientists have long been puzzled by a mysterious, diffuse glow of gamma rays detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, first observed in 2008.",
    "The glow has been explained by two competing theories: pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars) and collisions between dark matter particles, particularly Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).",
    "Traditional models assumed dark matter to be spherical, but new supercomputer simulations show that dark matter in the galactic center may be squashed into an egg-shaped structure, matching the observed bulge-like glow.",
    "This new simulation increases the probability that the glow could be due to dark matter, suggesting a 50% chance over the pulsar theory, according to coauthor Joseph Silk of Johns Hopkins University.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate by 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to determine whether the glow originates from dark matter or pulsars.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter, the theoretical possibility that WIMPs could produce gamma rays via annihilation remains a leading explanation and a major focus of ongoing research.",
    "The discovery of such a connection would be a groundbreaking milestone in physics, confirming dark matter's existence and nature, and resolving one of the most persistent mysteries in modern science."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are investigating a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008. The glow's shape — matching the galactic bulge — has long been a point of contention between theories involving pulsars and dark matter. A new study led by Joseph Silk of Johns Hopkins University used supercomputer simulations to show that dark matter could form a squashed, egg-shaped distribution at the galactic center, closely matching the observed glow. This increases the probability that the glow might originate from dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs, which annihilate and produce gamma rays. While the study does not provide definitive proof, it adds significant weight to the dark matter hypothesis. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will provide high-resolution data to confirm or reject this link, potentially resolving one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics: the nature of dark matter.",
