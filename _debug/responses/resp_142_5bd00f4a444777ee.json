  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened its export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals — including five newly added ones — and restricted access to specialized refining equipment, effective December 1, 2025. The move comes just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. As the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, China uses these controls to assert strategic leverage over key defense and technology sectors, particularly the United States, which relies on Chinese supplies for critical applications such as fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, and AI semiconductors. Analysts interpret the restrictions as a diplomatic signaling tool, designed to pressure the US during negotiations and to widen the technological and military capability gap. While humanitarian exemptions for emergency medical and disaster relief are maintained, the move highlights the deep interdependence of the US and Chinese economies and the strategic importance of rare-earth metals in modern technology and national security.",
