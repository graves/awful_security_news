The tax, proposed as part of a 2023 net-zero emissions agreement for shipping, faced strong opposition from the US and oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia, who labeled it a 'scam tax' and threatened economic sanctions. Despite support from the European Union, Brazil, and small island states such as Vanuatu, the vote was delayed by 12 months after a motion by Singapore was passed. Experts warn that the failure undermines climate diplomacy, delays clean shipping innovation, deepens global inequities, and sets a concerning precedent for future climate negotiations like COP30 in Brazil, where ambition may also falter.",
