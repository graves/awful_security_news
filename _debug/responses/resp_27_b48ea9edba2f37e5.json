  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is investigating federal enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment in Chicago that led to over 1,000 migrant arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, 2025. In response to concerns about excessive force and lack of warnings, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to activate body-worn cameras during protests. While CBP agents (over 200) are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued them and must go through Congress for approval. Judge Ellis pressed officials on training, transparency, and incident reports, including a notable case where Pastor Rev. David Black claimed he was struck multiple times with pepper balls without warning. The federal leadership structure is described as unstable, with frequent personnel changes, such as Russell Hott’s departure from Chicago. The Trump administration has denied reports of tear gas use without warning, and internal reviews are conducted by ICE leadership and the Office of Professional Responsibility to assess force compliance. The judge plans to continue questioning high-ranking officials, including Hott and Bovino, to determine accountability and transparency in protest responses.",
