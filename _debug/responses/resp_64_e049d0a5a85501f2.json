  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, including potentially surrendering parts of the Donbas region. The meeting, held in the wake of a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin who proposed a territorial swap, reflected a shift in Trump’s approach—prioritizing a ceasefire along current battle lines over Ukrainian claims of full territorial recovery. While Zelensky described the encounter as tense but constructive, with both sides agreeing to maintain current frontlines, Trump denied calling for a full surrender of Donbas. The incident underscores growing tension between Ukrainian sovereignty demands and US strategic concerns about war escalation and civilian casualties, especially amid Trump’s broader push for rapid peace settlements, including in Gaza. This development highlights the complexity of peace negotiations in a war where territorial integrity and military strategy remain deeply contested.",
