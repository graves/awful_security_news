The Compact required schools to enforce gender-based policies, freeze tuition, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized testing, among other provisions. Institutions including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia rejected the proposal on grounds that it conflicts with academic merit, scientific integrity, and the principle of fair research funding. The White House held a virtual meeting with several schools to discuss the compact, but dissent continued, with Dartmouth and UVA ultimately refusing to sign. This growing resistance highlights significant tensions between federal policy mandates and institutional autonomy in higher education, raising concerns about the impact of politically driven regulations on academic freedom and research integrity.",
