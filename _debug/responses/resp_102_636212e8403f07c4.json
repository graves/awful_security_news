Despite their vital role in protecting Congress and public officials, officers face mounting pressure from both financial hardship and political disrespect—such as the uninstalled Jan. 6 memorial plaque and the pardoning of rioters who attacked the Capitol. Lawmakers, including both Democrats and some Republicans, have expressed concern over the treatment of the force, with criticism directed at GOP actions and calls for negotiation or resolution. The Trump administration has proposed repurposing funds to pay federal law enforcement, though Democrats question the legality of such moves. While officers continue to perform their duties with professionalism, some express doubt about their long-term ability to endure the strain.",
