  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization in the United States during 2025, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates—spanning political affiliations, including Democrats and Republicans—united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and support for health insurance subsidies. The event, organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, featured personal stories from individuals like Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and John Manna, who all survived cancer and represent diverse political backgrounds. Despite partisan differences, participants emphasized that 'cancer doesn't care,' highlighting a rare moment of bipartisan solidarity. Volunteers visited 484 congressional offices, with success achieved on research funding and screening access, though some Republican lawmakers opposed insurance subsidies. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where 10,000 tea lights honored individuals affected by cancer. The event underscores that shared personal experience with illness can overcome political divisions and serve as a powerful force for public health advocacy.",
