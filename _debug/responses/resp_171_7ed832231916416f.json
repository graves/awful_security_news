  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a plan to curb shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the global carbon tax. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 and incentivized cleaner fuels, had already been approved in April 2025. Despite support from major economies like China, the EU, and the UK, opposition from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and shifts in support from Argentina and Singapore led to the postponement. The decision undermines climate goals, as shipping is a major contributor to global emissions, and raises concerns among shipping industry leaders and vulnerable nations like Vanuatu about the urgency and feasibility of climate action. The event reflects broader geopolitical tensions between climate advocacy and fossil fuel interests, especially under U.S. policy shifts since January 2025.",
