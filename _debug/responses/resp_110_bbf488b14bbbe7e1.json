    "The term 'enshittification' describes the process by which internet platforms degrade in quality over time, turning from user-friendly services into exploitative and profit-driven systems.",
    "This degradation occurs in three stages: (1) initial user acquisition with strong incentives, (2) business customer favoring at the expense of users, and (3) financial exploitation of both users and merchants, leading to poor user experiences and high costs for businesses.",
    "Major platforms like Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Uber, and Google are cited as examples of enshittification, with specific claims about data misuse, predatory pricing, algorithmic manipulation, and junk fees.",
    "The core causes of enshittification are a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, particularly the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Solutions proposed include stronger antitrust enforcement, interoperability standards (e.g., allowing users to transfer data between platforms), and the 'right to exit' — enabling users to take their data and content with them when leaving a platform.",
    "Despite platform denials, such as Amazon's claim that its services have improved, Doctorow cites studies showing that Amazon's search results are skewed and that merchants face significant fees, reducing their profits."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article by Greg Rosalsky presents a theory developed by internet activist and journalist Cory Doctorow about the degradation of major internet platforms — a phenomenon he calls 'enshittification.' Doctorow outlines three stages of this process: first, platforms attract users with low prices and strong incentives; second, they shift focus to business customers, using data to manipulate user feeds and subsidize their own services; and third, they exploit users and merchants through predatory pricing, junk fees, algorithmic bias, and high switching costs. Examples include Facebook’s manipulation of user content feeds and Amazon’s alleged product cloning and search algorithm bias. The article argues that the root causes are a lack of competition and weak antitrust regulation, particularly the consumer welfare standard. Doctorow proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, interoperability standards, and a 'right-to-exit' policy to empower users and restore platform accountability. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the article cites studies and technical evidence to support the theory, highlighting a growing anti-tech monopoly movement both domestically and internationally.",
