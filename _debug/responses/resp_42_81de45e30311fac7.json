  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government remains shut down as of October 2025 due to Congress failing to pass the required 12 appropriations bills. This marks a full shutdown, unlike the 2018 incident, which was partial and lasted 35 daysâ€”making it the longest in nearly 50 years. The 2018 shutdown, beginning on December 22, 2018, and ending on January 25, 2019, cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected around 800,000 federal employees, including 300,000 furloughed workers. The current shutdown is driven by political gridlock, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson leading a narrow House majority and the Senate unable to overcome a filibuster, which blocks passage of essential legislation. This reflects a broader trend of increasing political polarization since 1990, where six shutdowns have occurred since 1990 despite federal agencies having been instructed to cease operations during funding lapses since the early 1980s.",
