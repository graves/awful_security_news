  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed FDA label changes that would warn pregnant women about a potential link between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that Tylenol use increases autism risk, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children—shows no causal link. Major medical organizations, including ACOG and international regulators in the EU, UK, and Canada, affirm that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that the proposed labeling changes are unsupported by science, arbitrary, and contrary to FDA precedent. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a petition to add warnings, but the FDA has not updated its official website or findings to reflect such claims.",
