  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute shows that a majority of Americans — 56% — now view President Donald Trump as a potentially dangerous dictator who is exceeding his constitutional powers, a significant increase from April when it was 52%. The poll also reveals that 54% believe Trump is waging an 'assault on constitutional balances and the rule of law'. These views are supported by nearly half of Americans — 45% strongly agree he is a dangerous dictator, and 43% strongly agree he is undermining checks and balances. Despite Republican efforts to dismiss the 'No Kings' rallies as extremist or nonsensical, the data suggests the movement has found broad public resonance. The sentiment reflects a deepening concern over executive overreach, which has intensified under Trump compared to previous administrations. Historical comparisons with Obama and Biden show that such concerns are not new, but their intensity and public support are now at a record level, indicating a significant shift in American political consciousness.",
