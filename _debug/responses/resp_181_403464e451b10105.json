  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS DNS error at its northern Virginia data center caused widespread outages affecting major platforms including Snapchat, Reddit, Roblox, Fortnite, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and government services such as HMRC. The incident underscores the immense dependency of the internet on a single US-based cloud provider, with limited viable alternatives like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, and Alibaba. Experts warn that the overreliance on AWS exemplifies a systemic risk, especially in regions like the UK and Europe, where there is a growing debate over whether to build domestic cloud infrastructure to reduce foreign dependency. While the root cause appears to be a common maintenance or configuration error, not a cyberattack, the event highlights urgent calls for diversification in cloud service providers to ensure greater resilience and stability in global digital services.",
