The ceasefire marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough, with both sides agreeing to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and hold follow-up meetings to ensure implementation. The conflict stems from mutual accusations: Pakistan blames Afghanistan for harboring armed groups that attack its territory, while Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of conducting military strikes and spreading misinformation about its internal security. The Taliban denies providing safe havens to insurgents, and both nations remain deeply skeptical of each otherâ€™s intentions. The agreement comes amid rising tensions since 2021 and a recent suicide attack on Pakistani soldiers near the border, underscoring the urgency of resolving the border conflict.",
