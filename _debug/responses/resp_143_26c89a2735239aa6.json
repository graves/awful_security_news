  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine island of Catanduanes, more than 9,000 residents have evacuated due to threats of coastal flooding and strong winds. The storm, forecast to pass near the island with gusts up to 80km/h and waves up to 1.2 meters, is part of a recurring pattern in which Catanduanes—often the first landmass hit by Pacific cyclones—conducts regular evacuation drills. This event occurs amid a period of heightened natural disaster activity, including recent earthquakes in Cebu and the southern Philippines, and typhoon Ragasa in September. Experts link increasing storm intensity to climate change, indicating a broader environmental trend that heightens the frequency and severity of disasters in vulnerable regions.",
