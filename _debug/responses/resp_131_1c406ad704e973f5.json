  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fire broke out overnight at Hungary’s Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta, prompting emergency response and raising concerns about fuel supply and energy security. Despite no injuries reported, the incident underscores Hungary’s continued reliance on Russian oil, which contrasts with the EU’s broader policy of phasing out Russian energy imports since 2022. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and MOL, Hungary’s state-owned energy company, has confirmed that emergency protocols were followed and that domestic fuel supply is secure. Air quality has been monitored and remains within safe limits. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán affirmed that fuel supplies are stable and emphasized the need for a thorough investigation. This event highlights both the vulnerability of critical energy infrastructure and Hungary’s divergence from EU energy transition policies.",
