Once imprisoned by the state he challenged, Odinga is now honored with full military rites, symbolizing national reconciliation. His absence threatens to destabilize the political balance, particularly within President William Ruto’s government, which relies on Odinga’s influence to manage dissent. The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) is fractured over whether to support Ruto in the 2027 election, raising fears of a shift toward personality-driven politics. Analysts warn that without Odinga’s moral leadership, Kenya may face increased public unrest, coalition fractures, and a potential mass movement demanding change. Meanwhile, Odinga’s legacy — likened to that of Nelson Mandela — is seen as a beacon for future generations of political activists committed to inclusive democracy.",
