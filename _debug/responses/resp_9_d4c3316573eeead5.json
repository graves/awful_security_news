  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December 2023 for fabricating parts of his biography and pleaded guilty to fraud charges in August 2024, was released from prison in October 2025 after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence. The commutation followed claims of mistreatment in solitary confinement and was supported by Santos’ legal team and several Republican lawmakers, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Anna Paulina Luna. While Santos expressed remorse and took full responsibility for his actions, the decision sparked political debate, with critics like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accusing Trump of ignoring urgent national issues like healthcare in favor of a high-profile clemency case. The case underscores broader tensions around political accountability, presidential power, and the ethics of leniency in cases of fraud.",
