  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 18, 2025, large-scale 'No Kings' protests began across the United States in response to President Donald Trump's perceived authoritarian leadership. Protesters, including individuals like Beth Zasloff and Massimo Mascoli, gathered in major cities such as New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, holding signs that read 'Democracy not Monarchy' and 'The Constitution is not optional'. They argue that Trump's use of executive orders, tariffs, and National Guard deployments signals a move toward fascism, drawing on historical parallels to Italy's 20th-century fascist regime. The protests are framed as peaceful and democratic, with organizers emphasizing non-violence, though Republican governors including Greg Abbott and Glenn Youngkin activated National Guard units in anticipation. In response, Democrats criticized the deployment as undemocratic. International solidarity protests occurred in Europe, reflecting global concern over U.S. democratic erosion. The protests underscore a deep public divide over Trump’s leadership, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing 58% disapproval, and highlight ongoing tensions between civil liberties and state security.",
