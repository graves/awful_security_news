The project, which was first announced in July 2025, is claimed to be privately funded with contributions from businesses and individuals, including a donation from Carrier Global Corp. for HVAC systems. While the White House asserts that offices in the East Wing will be temporarily relocated and the existing building is respected, the demolition raises concerns about federal oversight, historical preservation, and procedural compliance. The ballroom, designed to seat up to 999 people, is intended to replace the small East Room and allow for larger events, including hosting international dignitaries without relying on South Lawn pavilions. Construction is scheduled to be completed before Trumpâ€™s term ends in January 2029.",
