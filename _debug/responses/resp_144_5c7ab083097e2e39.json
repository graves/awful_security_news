  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bosnia’s Republika Srpska has installed Ana Trisic Babic as interim president, following the formal recognition that Milorad Dodik is stepping aside from office after being banned from politics by a Bosnian court. Dodik, a pro-Russian nationalist and former president, had refused to vacate his position despite being sentenced to one year in prison and barred from political office for six years. His defiance of the international envoy Christian Schmidt and attempts to maintain power through the Bosnian Serb parliament led to legal and political consequences, including the revocation of his mandate by the Central Electoral Commission and the annulment of separatist laws that challenged the Dayton Accords. The US Department of the Treasury recently removed four of Dodik’s allies from sanctions, a move he welcomed, reflecting ongoing international pressure. The political transition underscores the fragility of Bosnia’s post-war governance and the continued threat posed by separatist ambitions, especially with regional allies such as Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban supporting Dodik’s agenda.",
