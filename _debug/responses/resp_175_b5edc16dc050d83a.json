  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 exposed the global vulnerability of digital infrastructure to failures in major US cloud providers. With AWS and Microsoft Azure dominating the UK cloud market, critical services such as banking and government operations—like Lloyds Bank and HMRC—were disrupted. Experts warn that over-reliance on a few tech giants creates 'nested dependencies' and systemic risk, even if services aren’t directly hosted on their platforms. While using cloud providers offers cost and scalability benefits, the lack of competition and the high cost of migration raise concerns about digital sovereignty. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to enforce competition. Experts call for government intervention to mandate data resilience, require use of multiple cloud providers, and promote a more open, competitive, and resilient cloud market.",
