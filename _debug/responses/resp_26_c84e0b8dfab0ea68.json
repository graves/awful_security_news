  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline. The poisoning occurred over several days in March 2023, beginning with arsenic delivered via Amazon, followed by orders for potassium cyanide and oleandrin. Craig used a fake email account to research poisons and purchased large quantities of Visine eyedrops, which contain tetrahydrozoline, a substance known to stop the heart when ingested. Angela visited the hospital multiple times, with worsening symptoms and toxic blood samples showing elevated levels of these substances. A key moment occurred on March 13 when a package of potassium cyanide was delivered to the dental office and opened by an employee, who then reported it to colleagues. The office manager Caitlin Romero, aware of the substance and its dangers, raised alarms and alerted James Craig’s business partner, Dr. Ryan Redfearn, who then informed hospital staff. Forensic toxicology confirmed lethal levels of all three poisons in Angela’s blood. Craig was arrested in March 2023, and later charged with plotting to kill four people while awaiting trial. The case highlights a disturbing pattern of premeditated domestic violence, the use of common household products for lethal purposes, and the importance of medical staff and office personnel in detecting and reporting suspicious activity.",
