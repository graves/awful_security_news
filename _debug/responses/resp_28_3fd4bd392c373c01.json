    "Iceland, historically free of wild mosquitoes due to its cold climate, has confirmed the presence of the Culiseta annulata species in the wild for the first time.",
    "The mosquitoes were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected a strange fly at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The species Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing it to survive harsh winters through sheltered environments.",
    "This marks the first confirmed record of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment, unlike a single isolated mosquito found on an airplane years ago.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquitoes may have arrived via ships or containers, but their long-term survival and establishment remain uncertain.",
    "Climate change is likely to increase the potential for mosquitoes to spread into Iceland, though experts are cautious about directly linking the discovery to global warming.",
    "Experts such as Colin J. Carlson of Yale University suggest that while warming may facilitate mosquito expansion, it is not yet clear whether climate change directly caused this specific discovery."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has confirmed the first-ever presence of wild mosquitoes in its natural environment, with three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, in October 2025. The discovery, initially reported by resident Björn Hjaltason who noticed an unusual fly, was verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson. This marks a significant ecological shift, as mosquitoes have long been absent from Iceland due to its extreme cold. While the species is adapted to cold climates and can survive winter in sheltered areas, the exact mechanism of their arrival remains uncertain—possibly via ships or containers. Experts debate whether climate change directly caused this event, noting that while warming increases mosquito range potential, the discovery may also reflect natural range shifts. Historical sightings of mosquitoes on planes have existed, but this is the first confirmed case in the wild. As global temperatures rise, such events may become more common, prompting concern about future public health risks and ecological changes in traditionally cold regions.",
