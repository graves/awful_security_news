  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey, ending weeks of escalating violence along their 2,611-kilometer border. The agreement prohibits hostile actions, support of militant groups, and attacks on civilians or critical infrastructure. Both countries commit to respecting each other’s sovereignty and holding a follow-up meeting in Istanbul on October 25 to review implementation. Key border crossings, including Chaman and Torkham, remain closed, disrupting trade and affecting thousands of refugees and local businesses. While the Taliban’s chief spokesman and Pakistani defense ministers confirmed the agreement, concerns remain about economic recovery and long-term peace. The conflict, rooted in disputed sovereignty over the Durand Line and rising militancy since 2021, has severely impacted civilians, with humanitarian and trade consequences.",
