  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a former victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl' in 2025, alleging that she was raped by a man described as a 'well-known Prime Minister' or 'former minister'—widely interpreted as Prince Andrew of the UK. The memoir details how she was trafficked to Andrew at age 17, where she suffered brutal physical and psychological abuse, including being choked and sexually assaulted, with the perpetrator laughing during the violence. Giuffre claims that Prince Andrew’s team tried to discredit her by hiring online trolls and asked a bodyguard to dig up dirt on her in 2011. Contradictory emails from 2011 show Andrew continued contact with Epstein, contradicting his claim of having broken ties in 2010. After a 2022 $1 million settlement, Giuffre called for an apology. The revelations have intensified scrutiny of the royal family and high-power figures linked to Epstein, prompting renewed investigations and public outrage, especially in the U.S. and U.K. Prince Andrew responded by relinquishing the title of Duke of York, though he retained the title of Prince.",
