  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article from CNN investigates the hidden labor abuses in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, which supply apparel to major U.S. brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite contributing nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, workers face exploitative conditions—long hours, minimal wages, wage theft, and threats of firing—while being largely unprotected due to the absence of direct contracts with U.S. brands. Korean-owned companies dominate the industry, controlling two-thirds of investments. Workers report sexual harassment, unsafe conditions, and fear of retaliation for unionizing. Union leaders have been threatened or killed, and labor inspectors are routinely blocked from entering factories. Although new policies under President Bernardo Arévalo aim to improve labor rights, enforcement remains weak. The article highlights how workers, like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, suffer financial and emotional devastation when laid off, with few avenues for redress or future employment, and underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in global supply chains.",
