  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as part of a $200 million project to build a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds. The space, designed with gold and crystal finishes and a seating capacity of 650, will replace the East Wing where first ladies have traditionally worked. President Donald Trump, who has long championed this project, claims it is a fulfillment of a 15-year vision and is funded by private donors. The construction includes modernizing the East Wing and reflects Trump’s broader aesthetic transformation of the White House, including gold décor in the Oval Office and paving over the Rose Garden. The White House defends the demolition by referencing a 1950s reconstruction under President Truman, arguing that structural modernization is part of the building’s history. Critics have raised concerns, but officials like Steven Cheung have dismissed such criticism as 'pearl clutching,' emphasizing that such changes are necessary and historically precedent-based.",
