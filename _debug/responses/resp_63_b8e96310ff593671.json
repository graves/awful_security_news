  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is challenging a proposed FDA label change that would warn pregnant individuals about a potential link between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD in children. The company argues that the claim lacks scientific support and that acetaminophen is one of the most studied medications with no proven causal link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite public statements from former President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggesting such a risk, multiple studies—including one involving over 2 million children—have found no significant associations. The FDA maintains no clear evidence of harm from appropriate use, and international regulators including the EU, UK, and Canada affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a petition urging label updates, but Kenvue and medical experts emphasize that such changes would be arbitrary and contrary to current scientific consensus.",
