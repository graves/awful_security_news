  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is applying his successful business branding strategies from the Trump Organization to the federal government, treating the administration as a marketable product. This includes launching initiatives like TrumpRx, a drug website; the Trump Gold Card, a high-cost immigration visa; a proposed Trump coin; the F-47 fighter jet; and rebranding the Rose Garden as the Rose Garden Club. These efforts are rooted in the long-standing slogan 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA), which has become a cultural movement. Trump and his team have streamlined communication and social media, increasing agility but also sparking controversy, including a racially insensitive AI-generated post. While not illegal, these actions violate longstanding norms of governmental neutrality, raising concerns about the commodification of public institutions. Experts note that Trump’s approach, like Apple or Nike, is effective due to its simplicity and memorability, but its application in government is ethically and institutionally problematic.",
