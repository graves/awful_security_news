  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed expectations of an imminent Trump-Putin summit, citing a lack of agreement on ceasefire conditions. While Trump initially announced a meeting in Hungary within two weeks, both the White House and the Kremlin have stated there are no current plans. Disparities over territorial demands—particularly Russia’s claim to control Ukraine’s Donbas region and its demand for dismantling Ukrainian military capabilities—have created a stalemate. Trump's proposal to freeze battle lines is supported by Ukraine and European leaders, but rejected by Putin, who insists on addressing 'primary causes' of the conflict. A preparatory meeting between US and Russian foreign ministers was canceled after a productive phone call, and Russian officials maintain that their position from the Alaska summit remains unchanged. The delay has intensified criticism of Russia’s peace efforts, with Ukraine and Europe accusing Moscow of stalling and continuing military aggression.",
