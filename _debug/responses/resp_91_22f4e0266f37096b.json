  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The fourth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party, convened under Xi Jinping, marks a critical moment for China’s political and economic future. Amid rising tensions with the United States over trade and technology, the leadership is reviewing and finalizing its next five-year economic plan—running from 2026 to 2030—focused on technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, new energy, and biotechnology. The meeting comes at a time of significant internal restructuring, including the removal of top military officials such as No. 2 general He Weidong and Miao Hua, reinforcing Xi’s anti-corruption purges and central control over the party and military. China’s economy has slowed to 4.8% growth in Q3 2025, driven by external pressures and domestic issues like overcapacity, deflation, and a property slump. While analysts expect Xi to maintain continuity in his strategy, the plenum may signal targeted shifts toward boosting consumption and addressing overproduction. A major personnel reshuffle is expected, possibly signaling the largest political shake-up at a plenum since 2017, underscoring the deepening control of Xi Jinping over China’s political and economic trajectory.",
