  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed plans for a near-term summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine, despite initial expectations following a recent phone call between the two leaders. The U.S. and Russia have both emphasized that no immediate meetings are planned, with Russia maintaining that its core demands — including control over Ukraine’s Donbas region and dismantling Ukrainian military capabilities — remain unchanged since the August Alaska summit. The United States is concerned about Russia’s maximalist stance, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders accuse Moscow of stalling and continuing violence. A phone call between U.S. and Russian foreign ministers has been conducted, but an in-person meeting has been canceled. The situation highlights a deep divergence in positions: Trump and Ukraine advocate for a frozen front as a starting point, while Russia insists on major territorial and political concessions.",
