  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a government shutdown in October 2025, the Trump administration announced that it would redirect tariff revenue—specifically from Section 32 tariffs, which traditionally supports child nutrition programs—to fund the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. The move was made to prevent the program from closing due to a lack of federal funding, as Congress had not passed a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it expressed concern over uncertainty about funding amounts, delivery timelines, and duration. Legal experts question the administration’s authority to use tariff funds without congressional appropriation, and the USDA has offered limited contingency support. The initiative reflects broader political tensions, with bipartisan support for WIC and Republican leaders blaming Democrats for the shutdown. Despite the temporary solution, advocates stress the need for long-term, stable funding to prevent cuts and ensure access to essential nutrition for vulnerable families.",
