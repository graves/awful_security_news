  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence on October 21, 2025, for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors—an act that violates French campaign finance laws. This marks the first time a former leader of modern France has served time in prison. Sarkozy, who left office in 2012, is being held in the VIP wing of La Santé Prison in Paris, a section typically reserved for high-risk political or criminal figures such as former dictators, terrorists, and armed criminals. Notable previous inmates include Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. Despite his claims of innocence and criticism of the judicial process as driven by hatred, Sarkozy's legal team has requested early release, with a two-month window for the court to decide. The case has drawn international attention to campaign finance integrity and accountability in democratic governance.",
