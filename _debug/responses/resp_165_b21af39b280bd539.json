  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as traditional signals like gunfire and observation of animal behavior or weather patterns—to detect and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Despite significant government investments in early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are frequently malfunctioning, poorly maintained, and distrusted by local populations. Real-life examples, such as shepherds Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, demonstrate how personal initiative and intergenerational knowledge have saved lives when official systems failed. The article highlights Pakistan’s status as a top 10 climate-vulnerable nation, with rising temperatures and melting glaciers, and emphasizes that effective disaster resilience requires not just technology, but community trust, cultural relevance, and inclusive participation in early warning processes.",
