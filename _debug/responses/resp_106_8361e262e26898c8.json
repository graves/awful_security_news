These events reveal recurring patterns of daytime, in-gallery theft using unbarred windows and simple tools, particularly targeting the Galerie d'Apollon. Despite past security upgrades and policy reforms, structural issues like overcrowding, outdated technology, and climate instability persist. The 2025 heist, which involved masked thieves using a truck-mounted hoist to steal eight valuable items including the crown of Empress Eugénie, reignites public and political concern. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a $834 million renovation plan, and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin acknowledged systemic failures in security. The article underscores that the Louvre’s cultural significance makes it a prime target, and its history of breaches highlights the urgent need for enhanced physical, technological, and environmental safeguards.",
