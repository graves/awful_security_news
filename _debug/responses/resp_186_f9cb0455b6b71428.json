  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As drone threats spread beyond conflict zones into civilian and commercial airspace, there is a growing need for effective and affordable countermeasures. Danish firm MyDefence has seen a dramatic shift in demand from defense contractors to civilian companies protecting infrastructure, using radio jamming to disrupt drone communications. Meanwhile, technological advancements in detection—such as acoustic sensors, high-resolution cameras, and smart radars—are improving the ability to identify small, hard-to-detect drones. Start-ups like Nordic Air Defence are developing low-cost, 3D-printed interceptors to shoot down drones, driven by lessons from the war in Ukraine where drone warfare has intensified. However, concerns over cost, safety, and civilian risk have led to a push for safer alternatives such as soft-kill methods (e.g., hacking) or netting. A central challenge is the lack of a global drone traffic management system, with experts calling for electronic license plates and flight registration to distinguish legal from illegal drones. Incidents in Poland, Romania, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, and Germany highlight that drone threats are now a widespread and urgent issue, prompting significant investments and policy changes across Europe and NATO.",
