  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "At a CNN town hall, progressive Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders criticized Republican inaction during the government shutdown, demanding a binding, long-term extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies before allowing the government to reopen. They argue that allowing subsidies to expire would lead to skyrocketing health insurance costs and a potential collapse of the healthcare system. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders accuse House Speaker Mike Johnson of refusing to convene the House to negotiate, citing political posturing over constituent needs. They also challenge Republican members like Marjorie Taylor Greene for lacking policy consistency. Meanwhile, internal Democratic tensions are highlighted, with Sanders criticizing Senate and House leadership for failing to endorse Zohran Mamdani in the NYC mayoral race. The town hall underscores a deep divide in Congress, where progressive Democrats frame the shutdown as a strategic tool for healthcare reform, while Republicans reject the demand as impractical and use procedural delays as a political tactic.",
