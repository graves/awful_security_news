  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that the United States will repatriate two survivors of a strike on a 'drug-carrying submarine' to Ecuador and Colombia, claiming the vessel was loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics. The attack marks the first time survivors have been reported from a US naval strike in the Caribbean, with prior operations off Venezuela resulting in at least 27 deaths. Trump defended the operation as a necessary countermeasure against drug trafficking, asserting that the submarine was specifically built for drug transport. However, the US government has not provided evidence of the vessel’s identity or individuals on board. Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed the return of a detained Colombian national, emphasizing legal processing under Colombian law. The actions have drawn criticism from UN human rights experts, who call the strikes 'extrajudicial executions', and have intensified geopolitical tensions, with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accusing the US of attempting to make Venezuela an 'American colony'. The use of homemade narco-submarines—designed to evade detection—reflects a growing trend in illicit drug transport, prompting both regional and international concern.",
