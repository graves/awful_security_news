  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. conducted a seventh military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean believed to be linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics. All three people on board were killed, and no U.S. personnel were injured. The operation reflects a broader Trump administration strategy to treat drug cartels as terrorist threats, using lethal force without due process or legal review. This approach has drawn criticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing an innocent national, and from U.S. lawmakers like Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, who warn that such actions amount to summarily executing individuals without trial. The strikes are part of a larger effort to pressure South American governments, including Venezuela, where the CIA has been authorized to operate. A classified legal opinion supports the designation of drug traffickers as enemy combatants, raising serious legal and ethical concerns about the expansion of executive power in military actions.",
