  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has suffered a major seven-minute daylight heist in October 2025, in which masked thieves used a truck lift to break into the Galerie d'Apollon and stole eight priceless items, including the crown of Empress Eugénie. This incident echoes earlier high-profile thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia, the 1976 theft of King Charles X’s diamond sword, and the 1990 and 1998 thefts of artworks by Renoir and Corot. These historical breaches reveal a pattern of vulnerability due to outdated security, overcrowding, climate instability, and disrepair. The Louvre, originally built as a royal fortress and opened as a public museum in 1793, continues to face systemic challenges, prompting public outcry, staff protests, and government responses. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a $834 million renovation plan, including new security systems and a dedicated space for the Mona Lisa. Officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have acknowledged institutional failure, emphasizing that the 2025 heist was possible due to lapses in physical and logistical security, such as allowing a furniture hoist to be parked in the city center.",
