  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests driven by Generation Z across Africa, Asia, and South America are increasingly challenging authoritarian and underperforming regimes. In Madagascar, a wave of Gen Z protests forced President Andry Rajoelina into exile, though power shifted to military leader Michael Randrianirina. Similar movements succeeded in Bangladesh (2024), Nepal (2024), and Sri Lanka (2022), showing a global trend. These movements are fueled by social media, economic grievances, corruption, and unemployment. While some leaders, like Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina and Kenya’s William Ruto, have been ousted or challenged, others—such as Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni—have resisted with repression and long-term rule. Experts warn that as Africa’s youth population grows and political consciousness rises, such movements may become more frequent and influential, prompting African leaders to be wary of youth-led political change. The article suggests that Madagascar’s events could serve as a catalyst for renewed protests in other parts of Africa, especially where movements have previously stalled or been suppressed.",
