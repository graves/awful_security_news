  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The fragile U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Gaza faced its first major test when Hamas militants killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israel to launch deadly strikes and temporarily halt aid deliveries. Despite the escalation, Israel resumed enforcement of the ceasefire and restored aid deliveries the next day. Hamas accused Israel of ceasefire violations and claimed communication with its units in Rafah had been severed, while Israel accused Hamas of failing to return all 28 deceased hostages. Only 25 bodies have been identified by Gaza’s Health Ministry, with Israel releasing 150 bodies, some of which are decomposed and missing limbs. A senior Egyptian official reported ongoing round-the-clock negotiations to de-escalate tensions, and Hamas has reaffirmed its refusal to join a postwar governing body in Gaza. The U.S. remains silent on immediate developments, while the ceasefire's long-term success hinges on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and establishing a Palestinian-led administrative structure. The humanitarian toll remains severe, with at least 36 Palestinians, including children, killed in strikes and Gaza facing a prolonged famine and aid blockade.",
