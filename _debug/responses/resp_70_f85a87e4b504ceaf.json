  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "ICE arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of illegally overstaying a tourist visa from Montenegro since 2015. The arrest occurred during a targeted enforcement action by the Department of Homeland Security, raising concerns about the hiring of individuals without proper immigration status in public service. Despite the village confirming Bojovic’s legal work authorization at the time of hiring and conducting thorough background checks, the incident has sparked debate over law enforcement integrity and due diligence. The mayor of Hanover Park affirmed that all hiring procedures were followed, and if Bojovic is found to have lawful status, he may return to full duty. This case is part of a broader pattern of immigration enforcement actions involving public officials, such as the earlier arrest of an Iowa school superintendent.",
