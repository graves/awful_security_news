  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) have been found to modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants exhibit proactive social distancing—infected individuals isolate themselves and healthy ants, particularly nurses, increase distance from foragers. Researchers, including Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie, discovered that infected colonies build nests that are more compartmentalized, less interconnected, with greater spacing between entrances and longer travel routes, which reduces disease transmission. These structural changes complement social behaviors, forming a system of 'architectural immunity' that protects vulnerable colony members. The study, published in the journal Science, demonstrates that non-human social species actively modify their environments to combat disease—an insight with potential applications in human architecture and public health design, particularly in creating spaces that reduce disease spread through spatial segregation and isolation.",
