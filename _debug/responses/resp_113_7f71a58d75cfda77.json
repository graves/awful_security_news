  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines how former President Donald Trump has used the National Guard in multiple U.S. cities—including Chicago, California, D.C., and Memphis—to support immigration enforcement operations, often under the guise of combating urban crime. Despite data showing no link between undocumented immigrants and violent crime, Trump's rhetoric has conflated immigration and lawlessness, fueling fear among communities. The National Guard, which legally cannot make arrests, has been deployed to guard ICE facilities, protect federal agents, and assist in raids. This has led to confusion among residents, especially immigrants and U.S. citizens, who cannot distinguish between federal law enforcement and military personnel. Legal experts and advocates argue that the administration is using aggressive immigration enforcement to generate public protests, which are then used as justification for deploying the military. Cases such as the federalization of the California and Illinois National Guards, and the use of Texas Guard troops in Illinois and at the border, show a pattern of militarized immigration policy. These actions have faced legal challenges, including a ruling in California that violated the Posse Comitatus Act, and are under appeal. The article concludes that the growing overlap between immigration enforcement and military presence undermines public trust, raises constitutional concerns, and reflects a broader political strategy that prioritizes fear over evidence.",
