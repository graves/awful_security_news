The primary threats come from Russian, Chinese, and Iranian state actors, including over 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots and Russian-linked arson and surveillance operations. A recent case involving Bulgarian nationals accused of running a British-based Russian spy ring underscores the growing presence of foreign intelligence operations in the UK. McCallum also highlights the emerging use of artificial intelligence by terrorists for propaganda and weapons research, while cautioning against overhyping its dangers. The article emphasizes the convergence of state-sponsored threats and extremist ideologies, such as those linked to ISIS and far-right extremism, as a major challenge to UK security.",
