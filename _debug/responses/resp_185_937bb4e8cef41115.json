  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Violent protests outside the Citywest migrant hotel in Dublin on Tuesday evening were orchestrated online via social media, with groups inciting hatred and violence. The unrest, triggered by an alleged sexual assault of a young girl, began as a peaceful demonstration but escalated into a violent riot involving bricks, fireworks, glass bottles, and horse-drawn sulkies. Gardaí faced sustained physical attacks, including a police helicopter being targeted with lasers and a vehicle being set on fire. Five men were charged with public order offences, while one woman was released without charge. Officials confirmed the violence was pre-planned and contained within a specific area, allowing for a more effective response than in 2023. Authorities emphasized their ability to identify and prosecute masked individuals using CCTV and bodycam footage. The Taoiseach condemned the attacks on police as unacceptable and called for justice, while Gardaí affirmed their commitment to protecting community safety and upholding the rule of law.",
