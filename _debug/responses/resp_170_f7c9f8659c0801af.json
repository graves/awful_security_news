  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, notably targeting Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 with a surgical drone and missile strike on October 10, 2025. The attack, involving 465 drones and 32 missiles, destroyed critical power and heating systems, leaving millions without electricity and water. This marks a strategic shift in Russian tactics—moving from general attacks to precision strikes on energy facilities like power stations and gas pipelines—aimed at leaving civilians vulnerable during the expected harsh winter. Russian modifications to missiles and drones have drastically reduced interception rates, from 37% to 6%, and corruption within Ukraine’s anti-drone defense programs has undermined infrastructure protection. As a result, Ukraine faces an unprecedented winter threat, prompting civilians to prepare with generators, power banks, and alternative fuels. Experts and officials warn that without urgent, effective infrastructure rebuilding and anti-corruption measures, the country may face a severe energy crisis that could endanger public safety and economic stability.",
