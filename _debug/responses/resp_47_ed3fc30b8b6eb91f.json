  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran since 2012—intensified in 2012 and again in 2018—have severely damaged the country's economy, leading to a dramatic shrinkage of the middle class, which historically served as a stabilizing and reformist force in Iranian society. A study using synthetic control methods found that without sanctions, Iran’s middle class would have grown by 17% between 2012 and 2019; instead, it shrank by 28%. This has led to rising inflation (42.4%), soaring prices of basic goods, and growing wealth inequality, with educated youth like Ali and Elham struggling to find work and afford basic needs. The political landscape has shifted from middle-class demands for reform to working-class protests focused on survival. Sanctions have also strengthened state-linked institutions like the IRGC and bonyads, deepening social resentment and undermining long-term stability. Experts warn that rebuilding the middle class is a generational challenge, even if sanctions are lifted.",
