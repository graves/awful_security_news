  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, including Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, by using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, who was not involved. The fraudsters requested over 1 million euros in money, with only former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti sending funds. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants rating them as more trustworthy. Global deepfake scam losses reached over $547 million between January and June 2025, and AI-generated child sexual abuse material is being produced at scale, prompting legal action in the US and Australia. While AI voice technology has beneficial applications such as restoring voices for those who can no longer speak, its misuse poses serious threats to personal identity, financial security, and public trust.",
