  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025, up from 376 in 2024, marking a slow but encouraging recovery after a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute this progress to sustained conservation efforts, including new Canadian management measures in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A key indicator of improvement is that four mother whales produced calves, with shorter calving intervals among established mothers, suggesting improved reproductive health. Despite this progress, the species remains highly vulnerable to ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear, and environmental groups stress that ongoing threats—especially from ocean warming and weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection Act—pose a risk to long-term survival. Experts emphasize that sustained annual growth is needed to ensure recovery, and the population remains on a fragile path requiring continued vigilance and policy support.",
