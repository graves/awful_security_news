  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago in response to protests at an ICE facility, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar actions in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that such deployments are unreviewable or at least entitled to great deference, drawing on the 1827 Supreme Court precedent in Martin v. Mott, which affirmed the president’s exclusive authority to determine national emergencies. However, Illinois officials and Judge April Perry challenge this view, asserting that protests are not equivalent to riots and that state and local law enforcement are sufficient. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision soon, with implications that could influence future National Guard deployments across the U.S.",
