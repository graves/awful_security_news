  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ruled that books on race and gender were removed from military base schools under politically motivated directives, not educational ones, and ordered their return. Students from military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy, and Japan claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were taken out of schools due to executive orders from President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, which banned content on Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and identity-based celebrations. The ACLU filed a legal motion to restore the books and curricula, noting that schools canceled events like Black History Month and removed posters of Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles found that the removals were not pedagogically sound but driven by improper partisan motives, and ordered immediate restoration of materials, highlighting a growing national conflict over educational freedom and censorship.",
