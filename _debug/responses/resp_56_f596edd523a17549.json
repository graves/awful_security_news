  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced increasing legal and political scrutiny after releasing two survivors of a failed submarine strike in the Caribbean, which it claimed involved 'narco-terrorists' threatening U.S. lives. Despite no public evidence of fentanyl trafficking or imminent danger, the administration opted to release the individuals to Colombia and Ecuador, undermining its narrative of a war against narco-terrorists. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Jack Goldsmith, argue that this decision reflects a lack of legal justification and transparency, suggesting the administration is avoiding accountability by bypassing civilian courts or wartime detention. The move raises serious questions about the legality of the strikes, the use of executive war powers without congressional approval, and the broader implications for U.S. policy and international relations in Latin America.",
