  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin may be delayed after an anticipated pre-meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was postponed due to divergent views on ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite Trump’s public calls for an immediate ceasefire and a meeting within two weeks, the Trump administration believes that Lavrov lacks real decision-making power and that talks with him are symbolic. The Kremlin maintains that a summit cannot be postponed without a set date, while U.S. officials see little practical value in a high-level meeting between Rubio and Lavrov. Future discussions may take place at an ASEAN-led summit in Malaysia, though no final plans are confirmed. This development reflects broader skepticism about the feasibility of diplomatic progress in Ukraine, with both sides emphasizing their positions without meaningful compromise.",
