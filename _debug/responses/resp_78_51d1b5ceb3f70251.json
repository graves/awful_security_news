  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The ongoing government shutdown has led to the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees, resulting in limited staffing, unregulated visitor access, and safety concerns in national parks such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Rocky Mountain. Despite closures, many parks remain open through state funding, particularly in West Virginia to preserve tourism during events like Bridge Day. While some businesses like tour operators and adventure guides report stable or rising activity, others like Mountain Mama cabins in Harpers Ferry note declining bookings. The shutdown has also driven a surge in visitors to private museums in Washington, DC, due to closures of the Smithsonian and National Zoo. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of rangers increases risks such as illegal drone use, base jumping, trash buildup, and vandalism, threatening both public safety and park integrity. The article underscores the economic and operational risks of prolonged federal shutdowns to national parks and surrounding communities.",
