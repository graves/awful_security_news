  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on October 20, 2025, lasting several hours and disrupting key internet services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking platforms. The root cause was a failure in Amazon's Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented websites and applications from accessing data stored in AWS databases like DynamoDB and EC2. Though AWS is generally reliable, the incident highlights a critical vulnerability in the modern internet’s architecture: its overreliance on a small number of centralized cloud providers. Experts note that such outages are not unprecedented, with previous global disruptions from CrowdStrike and AT&T demonstrating the systemic risks of fragile, non-decentralized digital infrastructure. While the outage was likely due to a technical fault, not a cyberattack, it underscores the urgent need for redundancy, better system design, and increased competition in cloud computing to ensure global internet resilience.",
