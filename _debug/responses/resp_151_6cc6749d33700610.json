  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, former President of France, has begun a five-year jail term at La Santé Prison in Paris after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy for accepting millions of euros from Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi to fund his 2007 election campaign. This makes him the first former head of state in the European Union to be imprisoned, marking a significant moment in political accountability. Though Sarkozy has always denied the allegations, the judge, Nathalie Gavarino, described the crimes as of 'exceptional gravity' and ruled that imprisonment is mandatory even with an appeal. He will be held in solitary confinement with limited contact and will be allowed one daily walk and three weekly visits. His lawyers have filed a release request, which the court will review within two months. The case has sparked public outcry and emotional reactions from supporters, who view it as a blow to democracy and the rule of law.",
