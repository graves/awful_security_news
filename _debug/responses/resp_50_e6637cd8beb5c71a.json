  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the international acclaim surrounding a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by President Donald Trump, Americans show little enthusiasm for the agreement, with polling data indicating minimal improvement in Trump’s approval ratings. While support on Gaza rose slightly to 47% (with 49% disapproving), Trump’s overall approval rating fell to a low point in his second term, with 37% approving and 61% disapproving. The article emphasizes that public concern over the economy — including inflation, rising costs of living, and job insecurity — far outweighs interest in foreign policy achievements. Polls show Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy, with fewer expecting wage growth or economic improvement. The fragility of the Gaza deal and prior collapses of peace agreements further erode public trust. Ultimately, the article concludes that the ‘economy, stupid’ principle dominates public sentiment, with Americans prioritizing domestic economic well-being over foreign policy outcomes.",
