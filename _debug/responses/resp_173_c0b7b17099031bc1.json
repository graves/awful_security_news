  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a high-level Trump-Putin summit in Budapest have been officially shelved by the White House, following a series of disagreements over core peace proposals. While Trump and Putin had discussed a meeting in late October, the White House stated that a preparatory call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rendered a face-to-face meeting unnecessary. Central to the impasse is Russia's demand for full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Donbas and recognition of Russian sovereignty over the region, which Ukraine and Western allies reject. In contrast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders have advocated for a temporary ceasefire along the current front line as a starting point for diplomacy. The only issue that prompted direct Russian engagement was the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which Russia views as a threat. With no breakthroughs in negotiations and increasing divergence on territorial and security issues, the cancellation of the Budapest summit underscores the difficulty of achieving a sustainable peace in Ukraine.",
