  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A surge in electricity bills across the U.S. is being driven by rising demand from artificial intelligence, particularly from data centers operated by tech giants like Meta and Microsoft. Despite a 13% average increase in electricity prices since 2022, the most significant factor is the rapid expansion of AI computing infrastructure, with data centers projected to consume 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Experts from the Department of Energy, Stanford, and market analysts attribute this growth to the computational intensity of modern AI tools and massive investments—such as Meta’s $17 billion and Microsoft’s $24.2 billion capital spending—into data center construction. While some regions like Oregon are implementing policies to make data centers pay for grid strain, current pricing models fail to reflect this surge, leading to higher bills for residential consumers. This article explores the link between AI development and increased energy costs, raising concerns about affordability and infrastructure readiness.",
