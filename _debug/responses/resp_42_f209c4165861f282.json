  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, who went missing after leaving an overnight shift at an assisted living facility in Philadelphia, were found behind an abandoned school. Authorities discovered the remains in a shallow grave after an anonymous tip led them to re-examine the area. DNA testing confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. Evidence including cellphone location data and a stolen black Hyundai Accent linked to the time of her disappearance and its subsequent fire adds to the case. Prosecutors say further investigation may reveal additional individuals involved, and while King was previously charged in a separate case (which was dropped), this new case involves serious criminal activity. The case has drawn public attention due to the emotional impact on Scott’s family and the severity of the alleged crimes.",
