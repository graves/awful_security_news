  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Arizona Representative Adelita Grijalva, claiming that the Constitution mandates the seating of duly elected members and that Johnson’s delay violates constitutional principles. Johnson justifies his refusal by citing precedent from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arguing he will administer the oath when the House returns to session. The lawsuit contends that the Speaker has no constitutional authority to delay swearing-in, especially since he does not dispute Grijalva’s qualifications or election, and that such a delay harms both her ability to serve and the interests of Arizona constituents. It also alleges Johnson is using the delay to influence budget negotiations and a petition over Jeffrey Epstein records. Grijalva has expressed a desire to meet with Johnson to resolve the issue, while the lawsuit seeks a court order allowing a qualified officer to administer the oath if Johnson refuses.",
