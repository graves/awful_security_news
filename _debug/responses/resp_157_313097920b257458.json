  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims in October 2025 linking autism to circumcision and acetaminophen, citing two studies—2013 and 2015—both of which show only weak correlations, not causation. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, emphasize that correlation does not imply causation, and that neither study examined acetaminophen use or accounted for confounding variables. The 2015 Danish study had extremely small sample sizes, with only 57 boys having both circumcision and autism diagnoses. A 2025 preprint from WPLab, not peer-reviewed and authored by a company promoting a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, was cited by Kennedy, raising concerns about scientific integrity and potential influence. Decades of research confirm that acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately under medical supervision. The claims are not supported by scientific consensus and are widely regarded as misleading and harmful to public health discourse.",
