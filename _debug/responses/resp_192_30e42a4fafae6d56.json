  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new marine species during a deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park in late 2022: a glowing lantern shark, found over 600 meters below sea level, and a small porcelain crab using hairs to filter feed on plankton. These discoveries highlight the rich, yet largely unexplored, biodiversity of Australia’s deep waters. The findings contribute to the understanding of unique adaptations in deep-sea ecosystems, with around 20 species identified so far and an estimated 600 more yet to be described due to the time required for scientific validation.",
