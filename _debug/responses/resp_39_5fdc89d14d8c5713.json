In response, community organizations like the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries organized a food pantry event in Landover, Maryland, which served more than 370 households—significantly exceeding expectations. Workers such as Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams express financial desperation, noting they have not received pay and now rely on emergency food assistance. The crisis has exposed the fragility of federal job security, prompting debate among lawmakers: GOP Senator Ron Johnson proposes paying only those working during shutdowns, while Democrats advocate for universal payment. The event underscores the human cost of political gridlock and the growing role of civil society in addressing federal employee hardship.",
