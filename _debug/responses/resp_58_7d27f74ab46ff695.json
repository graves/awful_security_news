  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Astoria, Queens, remains a rare success story in US manufacturing. Despite rising costs, trade tariffs, and a shrinking labor force, Steinway thrives by focusing on handcrafted quality, premium pricing, and a deep commitment to skilled craftsmanship. The company relies on a specialized workforce—such as Bernard Craddock—who have worked at the factory since the 1990s, maintaining a legacy of continuous production since 1873. While Trump’s trade policies aim to revitalize domestic manufacturing, they have created economic uncertainty, leading to job losses and business hesitation. Steinway’s success is not just due to its product quality but also to its ability to preserve traditional skills, source rare materials like Sitka spruce from Alaska, and maintain operations in New York City, where such high-value, labor-intensive manufacturing is rare. The article suggests that a revival of American manufacturing may not rely on mass production or cheap labor, but on preserving artisanal knowledge and legacy practices—traits exemplified by Steinway’s enduring model.",
