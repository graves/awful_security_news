  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man with a history of sexual abuse and identity fraud, to five years to life in prison for first-degree rape. Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was identified through a decade-old DNA match in a rape kit backlog. After allegedly faking his death in 2020 with a false obituary and using false identities including Arthur Knight, he was arrested in Scotland in 2023 and extradited to Utah in January 2024. He was convicted in two separate cases involving two women, one of whom was manipulated into a relationship through a Craigslist ad. Rossi claimed innocence, asserting the women were lying, but was found guilty by juries. The case highlights the dangers of flight risks and the importance of addressing rape kit backlogs and cross-jurisdictional law enforcement efforts.",
