  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed openness to joining a proposed summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, contingent on a format of 'shuttle diplomacy' and formal invitation. Zelenskyy raises concerns about Hungary's role as host due to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's pro-Russian policies and antagonism toward Ukraine. The summit, expected in the coming weeks, coincides with Trump's evolving position—shifting from calls for Ukraine to regain all territory to advocating for freezing the front lines. The presence of Putin, who faces an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes, adds significant ethical and diplomatic complexity, prompting criticism from EU leaders like Kaja Kallas and Lithuania’s Kestutis Budrys, who argue that such a meeting undermines international justice. Meanwhile, the Kremlin claims active peace efforts, while criticizing Ukraine's inconsistent messaging.",
