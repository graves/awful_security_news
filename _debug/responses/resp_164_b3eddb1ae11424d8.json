    "Antidepressants have significant and varied side effects that differ between drugs, with some causing weight gain, heart rate changes, or blood pressure increases.",
    "A new study by King's College London and the University of Oxford ranks 30 commonly used antidepressants based on their side effects in the first eight weeks of treatment.",
    "The study analyzed 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients and found that even patients with the same diagnosis may benefit from different antidepressants based on individual health conditions.",
    "SSRIs like paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline generally have fewer physical side effects, though fluoxetine (Prozac) is linked to weight loss and higher blood pressure.",
    "Dr. Toby Pillinger from King's College London provides personalized recommendations: Sarah should avoid weight gain (e.g., use agomelatine, sertraline, venlafaxine), John should avoid blood pressure-raising drugs (e.g., venlafaxine, amitriptyline), and Jane should avoid cholesterol-raising drugs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine, paroxetine).",
    "Prof. Oliver Howes and Prof. Andrea Cipriani emphasize that no antidepressant is universally 'good' or 'bad'—each has trade-offs, such as amitriptyline helping with sleep and pain despite its side effects.",
    "Currently, 85% of UK antidepressant prescriptions are for just three SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine), leading to a lack of personalized treatment.",
    "The researchers are developing a free online tool to help doctors and patients choose the most suitable antidepressant based on individual needs.",
    "The study’s findings may shift prescribing practices, reducing reliance on generic, low-cost drugs and promoting individualized care.",
    "The analysis is limited to the first eight weeks of treatment; long-term side effect accumulation, especially in chronic depression, remains uncertain and needs further study."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked 30 commonly used antidepressants based on their side effects in the first eight weeks of treatment, revealing major differences in physical impacts such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations. The research, which analyzed over 58,000 patients across 151 studies, found that even patients with the same diagnosis may require different drugs based on pre-existing health conditions—such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Personalized recommendations are provided for patients like Sarah (concerned about weight gain), John (with hypertension), and Jane (with elevated cholesterol), suggesting alternatives such as agomelatine, citalopram, or escitalopram. While SSRIs like sertraline and paroxetine generally have fewer side effects, drugs like fluoxetine show trade-offs with weight loss and elevated blood pressure. The study warns that the current over-reliance on just three generic SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine) in the UK could be reduced through personalized prescribing. Researchers are developing a free online tool to assist clinicians and patients in matching antidepressants to individual needs, though widespread adoption would require cultural changes in the NHS. Long-term effects and cumulative risks in chronic depression remain under investigation.",
