  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the United States, has paused job offers to foreign workers who require H-1B visas in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on the visas. This move, which affects over 2,000 currently employed H-1B workers, reflects growing corporate caution under stricter immigration policies. The H-1B visa program, designed to bring in high-skilled talent, faces significant financial and logistical challenges under the new fee, which disproportionately impacts skilled professionals from India, who have historically made up the majority of applicants. The policy shift underscores a broader trend in which major U.S. companies are adapting their hiring strategies to comply with or respond to changes in immigration regulations, potentially impacting both business competitiveness and global talent mobility.",
