    "The Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist known for discovering dynamite.",
    "The prizes are awarded annually to individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind in the preceding year, across six categories: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences.",
    "Each prize is awarded by a specific institution: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry, economics), the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet (medicine), the Swedish Academy (literature), and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).",
    "The 2025 medicine prize was awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, laying the foundation for new treatments in cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The 2024 medicine prize went to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for discovering microRNAs, which regulate gene expression.",
    "The 2024 physics prize was awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational work in machine learning and artificial neural networks.",
    "The 2024 chemistry prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for breakthroughs in protein structure prediction using AI, including the development of AlphaFold.",
    "The 2024 literature prize went to South Korean author Han Kang for her poetic exploration of violence and human fragility in works like The Vegetarian and Human Acts.",
