  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the dark realities of Guatemala’s garment factories—known as maquilas—where thousands of mostly female workers face exploitative conditions, including excessive quotas, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats to union activities. Despite their economic importance to Guatemala (accounting for nearly 10% of GDP), these factories operate in secrecy, with workers unable to form unions or hold management accountable. Korean-owned companies dominate the sector, and major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren benefit from supply chains without legal responsibility for labor practices. Workers such as Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial ruin upon layoffs, and union leaders like Corina Olivares have been threatened or killed. Government inspectors are blocked from entering factories, and despite progressive reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, enforcement remains weak. The article underscores a global pattern of labor abuse in fashion supply chains, where worker welfare is sacrificed for low-cost production.",
