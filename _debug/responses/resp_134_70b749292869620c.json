  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has confirmed the continued presence of a small U.S. military advisory contingent—between 250 and 350 personnel—at Ain al-Asad and al-Harir air bases, despite a prior agreement to withdraw U.S. forces by September 2025. This adjustment is due to rising fears of an Islamic State resurgence in Syria following the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The advisers are tasked with supporting counter-IS surveillance and coordination with the al-Tanf base in Syria. Meanwhile, al-Sudani emphasizes Iraq’s neutrality, urging the U.S. to resume direct negotiations with Iran and calling for disarmament and political integration of armed factions like the Popular Mobilization Forces, in preparation for upcoming parliamentary elections.",
