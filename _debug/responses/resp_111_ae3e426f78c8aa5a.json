  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' approaches, several leading institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the agreement. The compact, which demands policies such as banning transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports aligned with their gender identity, freezing tuition, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized testing, has drawn strong opposition from academic leaders who argue that tying federal funding to political priorities undermines research integrity, scientific merit, and academic freedom. The White House held a virtual meeting with several schools to discuss the compact, but no consensus was reached. Rejections highlight growing resistance among U.S. higher education leaders to politically mandated policies, especially those affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion, and signal a broader tension between federal political agendas and institutional autonomy in academia.",
