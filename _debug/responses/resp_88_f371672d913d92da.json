  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite a recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who opposed the idea and warned it would damage US-Russia relations. While Trump expressed interest in providing the weapons during a conversation with Putin, he is not expected to commit to sending them during his upcoming meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukrainian officials view the missiles as a game-changing deterrent capable of pressuring Russia into negotiations. The US administration has prepared plans to deploy the weapons if Trump decides, emphasizing that the threat serves as a diplomatic leverage tool rather than an immediate military action. Concerns over escalation remain, though some officials believe prior escalatory steps have not significantly intensified the conflict. A call between Putin and Trump just 24 hours before the Ukraine meeting was intended to delay the discussion, but Trump maintained his stance on the possibility of sending the missiles, indicating ongoing high-stakes negotiations between the world’s major powers.",
