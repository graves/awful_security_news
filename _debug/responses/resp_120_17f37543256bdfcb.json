  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing—home to the first lady’s offices—to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency responsible for overseeing such projects. President Donald Trump has publicly championed the project, claiming it has been desired for 150 years and that it will provide a larger, more modern space than the existing East Room, which he says is too small. The demolition, visible in dramatic photos, is occurring without formal regulatory clearance, and while the White House insists it will not damage the main mansion and will respect historical structures, it has faced criticism over procedural and legal violations. The project is being privately funded by Trump and various companies, including Carrier Global Corp., which has agreed to donate an energy-efficient HVAC system. The ballroom is expected to be completed by January 2029, with construction beginning in September 2025. The East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated, and the White House maintains that the new space will be a modern addition without destroying or damaging existing historic structures.",
