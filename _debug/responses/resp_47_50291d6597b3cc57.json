  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Justice Department prosecutors are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to represent James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos shared with him were unclassified and that the government’s later upclassification does not alter their original status. The dispute raises ethical questions about a lawyer being both a witness and a defense counsel in the same case. The case is embedded in the broader political context of Trump’s firing of Comey and the subsequent investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
