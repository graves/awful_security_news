  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants — particularly nurses — increase their distance from foragers to prevent disease spread. When exposed to the pathogen, ant colonies build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and more spaced entrances, which reduces transmission. These structural and social changes work synergistically to protect the colony, demonstrating a form of 'architectural immunity'. The research, led by Nathalie Stroeymeyt at the University of Bristol and Luke Leckie at Indiana University Bloomington, was published in the journal Science. Experts like Sarah Kocher at Princeton University suggest that these natural strategies could inspire human designs for public spaces that reduce disease spread through spatial planning and isolation of high-risk zones.",
