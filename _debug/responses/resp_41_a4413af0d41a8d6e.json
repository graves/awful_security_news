  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is evaluating the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which bypasses the standard Senate confirmation process required by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, initially served as interim US attorney and was later designated as special attorney, then delegated full authority by the attorney general. The DOJ argues that such delegation is a recognized and lawful practice, citing precedent where DOJ officials have served without Senate confirmation. Critics, including legal counsel Abbe Lowell, contend that delegating all powers of a US attorney—such as oversight of investigations and personnel—is unprecedented and unlawful. The case has broader implications, as similar challenges are underway in Nevada and California, and raises concerns about political appointments and congressional obstruction. The ruling may set a precedent for how future vacancies in US attorney roles are filled and whether executive branch delegation can legally substitute for Senate confirmation.",
