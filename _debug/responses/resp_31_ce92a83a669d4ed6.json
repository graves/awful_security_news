  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is engaging in high-stakes, politically controversial foreign policy actions toward Venezuela, including military posturing by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, covert CIA operations, and threats of regime change. These actions, which involve alleged drug trafficking and militarization, have sparked concerns over escalation and legality. Despite Trump’s claims, such assertions are widely dismissed by intelligence and judicial bodies. Public opinion in the U.S. is strongly against unilateral military intervention and regime change, with polls showing majority support for non-intervention in foreign affairs. The situation highlights a potential clash between Trump’s assertive foreign policy and public skepticism, raising concerns about political backlash and domestic opposition if action escalates.",
