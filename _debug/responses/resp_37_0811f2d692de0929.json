  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon's Glória funicular in September 2025 resulted in at least 16 fatalities and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped mid-journey on Calçada da Glória. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator CARRIS and that maintenance tasks were incorrectly recorded as completed, despite not being properly performed. Eyewitnesses described the derailment as chaotic and sudden, with one man, Bruno, recalling the scene as 'a toy being thrown' across the street. The interim report is not conclusive, and a final report is expected next year.",
