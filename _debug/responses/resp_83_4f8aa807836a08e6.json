  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Podcast host Joe Rogan expresses surprise at the extent of President Donald Trump’s militarized mass deportation campaign, a policy he did not anticipate despite Trump’s long-standing rhetoric. Polling data from multiple sources—including AP-NORC, CBS News-YouGov, and Pew Research Center—reveals that while most Americans believed Trump would pursue key policies like deportations, tariffs, and political prosecutions, they significantly underestimated the scale and intensity of his actions. In particular, Trump’s unprecedented pardons of January 6 defendants—including violent offenders—and aggressive DOJ investigations of political foes exceed public expectations. A growing number of Americans now believe Trump is going too far, with 48% saying his actions are worse than expected. This suggests that, far from being alone, Rogan is representative of a broader public reaction to Trump’s executive overreach, indicating a shift in public perception and trust in political leadership.",
