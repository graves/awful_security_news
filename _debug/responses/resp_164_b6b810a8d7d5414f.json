  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas of Pará. The investigation finds that JBS does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing illegally deforested cattle to be 'laundered' through transit systems that conceal their origins. This lack of traceability is exacerbated by Brazil’s outdated animal transit permit system (GTAs), which only records group-level data. The report highlights severe encroachments in protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where Indigenous communities face violence and displacement. Despite JBS’s past promises under the G4 Cattle Agreement to trace suppliers by 2011, it failed to deliver. The article underscores urgent calls for federal action, including mandatory, publicly accessible traceability systems, to stop deforestation and hold corporations accountable for environmental harm.",
