  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' access to long-term one-on-one mental health therapy through the VA is being significantly restricted, despite clinical evidence that many veterans, especially those with PTSD and chronic conditions, require ongoing care. Providers report that since 2021, under the administration of VA Secretary Doug Collins, therapy session limits have been enforced rigidly—often without patient or provider input—leading to staff resignations, re-traumatization of veterans, and a breakdown in therapeutic trust. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned and unsafe, while VA officials deny such limits exist. Critics, including the American Psychological Association, argue that short-term, standardized therapy models fail to meet the needs of veterans with lifelong mental health challenges. The article raises urgent ethical and practical concerns about whether the VA is prioritizing administrative efficiency over individualized, recovery-oriented care.",
