  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On Monday, October 21, 2025, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage at its data center in northern Virginia, caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error. This error prevented AWS from properly routing traffic to major services such as Snapchat, Reddit, Roblox, Fortnite, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and government bodies like HMRC. Despite the services being operational, users were unable to access them due to the DNS failure. The incident exposed the risks of over-reliance on a single cloud provider, with only a few viable alternatives like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform available. Smaller providers such as IBM, Alibaba, and Stackit exist but lack scale. Experts suggest that countries like the UK and Europe need to invest in local cloud infrastructure to reduce dependency on U.S.-based services, although current reliance remains high due to AWS’s dominance in the market.",
