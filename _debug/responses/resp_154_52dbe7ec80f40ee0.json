  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris over the weekend resulted in the theft of valuable royal jewelry, including items from Queen Marie-Amélie, Queen Hortense, and the crown of Empress Eugenie. The estimated value of the stolen items is over $102 million, with the Louvre curator estimating the loss at 88 million euros. The heist, which took just seven minutes and involved four masked thieves using a crane to break a window, has sparked national outrage over the museum's inadequate security, including only a quarter of one wing having video surveillance. Despite warnings from the Louvre director about outdated infrastructure, security upgrades have been delayed for years, as noted in a report by the Court of Auditors. The incident has led to public and political scrutiny, with the museum's director set to appear before the Senate’s culture committee. A separate theft at the Natural History Museum involving melted gold and a case in Limoges with items worth $7.6 million suggest a broader pattern of museum insecurity. A 24-year-old Chinese woman was detained in Barcelona after attempting to dispose of stolen gold, indicating possible criminal networks. The Louvre remains under investigation and is set to reopen after a two-day closure.",
