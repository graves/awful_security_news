  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) began early Monday, October 20, 2025, around 3 a.m. ET, originating from an erroneous software update to DynamoDB in Northern Virginia. This error triggered a cascading failure that disrupted major websites and applications, including Duolingo, Roblox, Fortnite, Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, Perplexity, ChatGPT, United Airlines, Canva, Reddit, and Flickr. AWS, which holds about 30% of the global cloud computing market, serves as the invisible backbone of the internet, allowing companies to store and manage data. The incident highlights the extreme vulnerability of modern businesses to failures in a single cloud provider. Experts, including Chang Lou and Betsy Cooper, emphasize that while reliance on AWS offers convenience and strong security, it also creates systemic risk—when one major provider fails, widespread disruptions ripple across industries, from finance to entertainment and healthcare. The event echoes prior outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike failure, and raises concerns about over-concentration in cloud computing infrastructure.",
