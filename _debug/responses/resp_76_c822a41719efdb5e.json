  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information after a multi-year investigation that began in 2020. The case was initially triggered by concerns over Bolton’s 2020 memoir, which Trump claimed contained 'massive amounts' of classified material, and later by an Iranian cyberattack on Bolton’s email account in 2021. FBI agents executed a search of Bolton’s home and office in August 2025, seizing documents labeled as 'secret' or 'classified,' including those on weapons of mass destruction. The prosecution, supported by six career prosecutors including Scott Lara and Kelly Hayes, built its case by examining emails shared with family members and documents found in physical archives. Despite years of political pressure from Trump, who repeatedly called for Bolton’s prosecution and criticized him as a 'lowlife,' the case remained under the scrutiny of career prosecutors. The final indictment was delivered in a brief, private proceeding, with the lead prosecutor Thomas Sullivan stating, 'Stay tuned,' underscoring the political and legal sensitivity of the case. This case reflects broader concerns about the weaponization of the Justice Department and the role of political figures in influencing federal investigations.",
