  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced growing criticism for its decision to release two survivors of a failed military strike in the Caribbean, which targeted alleged 'narco-terrorists' attempting to smuggle fentanyl. Despite lacking public evidence and failing to provide a legal basis for the strikes, the administration chose to return the men to Colombia and Ecuador, undermining its narrative of a war against imminent threats. Experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have questioned the legality and consistency of such actions, noting that the individuals were deemed too dangerous for detention but not severe enough for prosecution. The move appears to avoid legal accountability, especially through mechanisms like habeas corpus or civilian court proceedings. Criticism has grown both domestically and internationally, with Colombian President Gustavo Petro challenging the claims that the victims were involved in drug trafficking. Congress, particularly bipartisan lawmakers, has expressed concern over the lack of congressional approval and transparency, with some voting to halt the operations. The situation highlights a broader pattern of legally dubious executive actions, raising serious questions about due process, accountability, and the use of military force without a declared war or evidence of imminent harm.",
