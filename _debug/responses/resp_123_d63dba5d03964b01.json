  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once on the brink of extinction due to whaling and modern threats like ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement, is showing signs of recovery. Estimated at 384 individuals in 2025 — up from 376 in 2024 — the population has grown by 7% since 2020 after a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists, including Philip Hamilton and Heather Pettis from the New England Aquarium and NOAA, attribute the positive trend to sustained conservation efforts, including new management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. While only 11 calves were born this year, the presence of new reproductive females and fewer injuries suggest improved reproductive health. Despite cautious optimism, environmental groups stress that the species remains vulnerable and that weakening protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act could jeopardize ongoing recovery.",
