  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing wave of AI-powered voice scams has targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using artificial intelligence to clone the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam, which occurred in early 2025, exploited the realism of modern AI voice technology, which can now generate voices indistinguishable from real human ones. Research by Queen Mary University of London, using tools like ElevenLabs, found that AI-generated voice clones were rated as equally realistic as real voices by participants and were even perceived as more trustworthy. This trend has led to global losses exceeding $547 million in deepfake scams between January and June 2025. The risks extend beyond financial fraud, with AI deepfakes being used to generate fake news and illegal content, including child sexual abuse material. In response, governments like the US and Australia have introduced new legal measures to criminalize the creation and distribution of AI-generated intimate images. The article underscores the urgent need for public awareness, regulatory action, and technological safeguards as AI voice technology becomes increasingly sophisticated and accessible.",
