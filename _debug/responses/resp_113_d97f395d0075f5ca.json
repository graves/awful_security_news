  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are locked in a closely contested race, with polling showing a tie in some cases. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, faces personal attacks from Ciattarelli over her exclusion from a military graduation and allegations of opioid policy failures, which Ciattarelli’s campaign has called defamatory. Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli and Obama’s endorsement of Sherrill add national significance. Despite New Jersey’s blue status in federal races, it has a history of purple gubernatorial elections, and a Sherrill win would mark the first three-term consecutive governorship from the same party since the 1960s. Voter concerns center on affordability, with energy costs having risen 17–20% in June and rising housing prices. The campaign’s personal attacks have intensified, but experts suggest affordability and cost-of-living issues will ultimately determine the outcome.",
