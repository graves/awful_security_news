  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has entered La Santé Prison in Paris to begin a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has served time in prison. Sarkozy, who has appealed his conviction, is being held in the VIP wing of the prison, typically reserved for high-risk political or criminal figures such as former dictators, terrorists, or violent criminals. The case draws global attention to issues of political accountability, campaign finance ethics, and judicial fairness. Despite his claims of innocence and his assertion that the conviction reflects political vengeance, his legal team is seeking early release. The incident underscores broader concerns about power, transparency, and the rule of law in democratic societies.",
