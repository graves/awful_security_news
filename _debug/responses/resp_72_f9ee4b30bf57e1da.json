It became a cultural touchstone, influencing generations and setting a new standard for romantic narratives in Indian cinema. The film’s success is attributed to its authentic portrayal of cross-cultural identity, emotional depth, and musical legacy. It inspired a wave of similar films, including 'Pardes', 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham', and 'Kal Ho Naa Ho'.
