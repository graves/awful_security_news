  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines (Flight 6469) made an emergency landing in Nebraska after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard knocking on the cockpit door. The flight departed Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. and returned just 18 minutes later. The Federal Aviation Administration determined that the issue was due to a malfunction in the inter-phone system, not a security breach. Despite the urgency, no security incident was confirmed, and the airport authority clarified that the event was an internal communication failure. The incident involved an Embraer ERJ 175 regional jet, which was surrounded by firetrucks, raising public concern. CNN has reached out to the airlines for further information.",
