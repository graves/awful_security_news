  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a reported Gaza ceasefire deal being hailed as a major diplomatic victory, public sentiment in the United States shows little enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s handling of the situation. While approval on the Gaza issue slightly increased in early polls, disapproval remained high, and overall approval of Trump has dropped to a second-term low, particularly on economic issues. Americans express deep concern about inflation, the cost of living, and job security, with pessimism about the economy rising to new lows. The article suggests that foreign policy achievements, even significant ones, are overshadowed by economic anxieties, and that public priorities place economic stability above international diplomacy. The fragility of the ceasefire and the ongoing regional tensions further underscore the lack of public confidence in the agreement or Trump’s leadership.",
