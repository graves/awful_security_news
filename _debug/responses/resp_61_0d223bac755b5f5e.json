    "A 155mm artillery shell fired during a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton exploded prematurely over I-5 interstate in California, dropping fragments on a parked California Highway Patrol (CHP) cruiser.",
    "The shell detonated on Saturday, October 21, 2025, during a live-fire exercise that had been planned to fire over the highway, which is one of the busiest in the U.S.",
    "No injuries were reported, but the incident drew public concern and criticism, especially from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had closed I-5 ahead of the exercise citing safety risks.",
    "The Marine Corps is investigating the cause of the premature detonation, with officials noting that the shell had previously fired successfully in a batch, raising questions about consistency and safety of the batch.",
    "The shells are part of a larger U.S. production surge — more than tripling since 2022 — driven by Ukraine’s war effort, with over 3 million rounds sent to Ukraine since 2022.",
    "A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed manufacturing issues, including cracked shells in Iowa and a change in explosive composition from TNT to a more stable alternative, later reverted to TNT for cost and production efficiency.",
    "Retired Marine Corps colonel Mark Cancian noted that firing over I-5 was theoretically safe due to high altitude, but a premature explosion indicates a failure in either manufacturing or handling protocols.",
    "The incident occurred during a VIP event with Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth present, suggesting such demonstrations are common for high-profile visits, but the premature detonation was abnormal and concerning."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate, dropping fragments on a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The incident, which occurred on October 21, 2025, raised significant safety concerns, especially as it was the first such firing over I-5 in over 70 years. No injuries were reported, but the event prompted criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had closed the highway ahead of the demonstration. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause, with officials noting that the shell had previously fired successfully from the same batch, raising questions about manufacturing or handling. Background context includes a surge in U.S. 155mm shell production since 2022, driven by Ukraine’s war effort, and earlier reports of manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and changes in explosive composition. Experts like retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian stress that while high-altitude firing was theoretically safe, the premature detonation was abnormal and highlights potential flaws in current munitions or protocols.",
