  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-firing demonstration at Camp Pendleton, California, as part of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th birthday celebration, a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate, causing fragments to strike a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. The incident, which occurred despite the route having not been used since the 1950s, raised public safety concerns and sparked tension between state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, and military leadership, such as Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause of the premature detonation, especially given that a similar batch had previously fired successfully. Experts like retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian have noted that such an event is abnormal and suggests possible manufacturing issues, possibly linked to a prior shift in explosive composition and a 2024 Reuters investigation into shell defects. No injuries were reported, but the incident underscores broader concerns about the safety, reliability, and oversight of large-scale military munitions production, particularly as the U.S. ramps up production to support Ukraine’s war effort.",
