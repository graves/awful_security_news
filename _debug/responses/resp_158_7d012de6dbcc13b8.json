  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced poet Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024, classifying the act as a 'terror attack' due to political motivation. Cintula, from Levice, claimed he was driven by 'moral despair' and sought to protest against Fico’s government, particularly its decision to halt military aid to Ukraine. The incident has intensified political polarization, with Fico accused of authoritarianism, including crackdowns on dissent and opposition to EU and NATO policies. Critics argue the trial outcome reflects a broader crisis in Slovak democracy, while Cintula’s defense frames the act as a protest against political corruption and the abuse of power. The case has also led to a constitutional amendment limiting same-sex rights and asserting national law over EU law, signaling a shift toward more nationalist and conservative policies.",
