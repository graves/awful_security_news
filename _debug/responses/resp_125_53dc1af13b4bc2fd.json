  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison after being extradited from France in 2024. The case, which had lain dormant for over a decade, gained renewed attention when Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you' in 2019, prompting the victim, Shannon Keeler, to resume legal efforts. Keeler, who had initially tried to press charges but faced systemic failures including destroyed evidence and prosecutorial reluctance, shared her story publicly in 2021, which contributed to Cleary’s indictment. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, considered Cleary’s guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness when issuing a sentence below state guidelines. The case highlights broader failures in how campus sexual assault cases are handled, including delayed prosecution, loss of evidence, and lack of accountability, while also showing the emotional toll on survivors and the potential for redemption through atonement programs.",
