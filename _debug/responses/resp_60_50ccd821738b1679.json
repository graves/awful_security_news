  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which its Domain Name System (DNS) failed to communicate with critical databases like DynamoDB, causing widespread inaccessibility of online services such as banking, social media, airline booking, and e-commerce platforms. The outage lasted several hours, with services restored by 6:35 AM ET. Experts believe the root cause was a technical fault in AWS’s DNS infrastructure, not a cyberattack, and note that this reflects a broader systemic vulnerability: the internet’s reliance on a few dominant cloud providers. Past outages—such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures—demonstrate how technical errors can lead to massive global disruptions. The incident underscores the urgent need for increased redundancy, decentralization, and competition in the cloud computing sector to build a more resilient internet.",
