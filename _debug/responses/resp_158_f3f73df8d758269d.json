  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has elected Cheng Li-wun as its new chairperson, marking a shift toward a reformist and peace-oriented leadership. Cheng, 55, defeated veteran candidate Hau Lung-bin and four others in a party vote with over 50% support, though turnout was low at under 40%. A key policy contrast is Cheng’s opposition to increased defense spending—unlike President William Lai Ching-te’s administration and U.S. policy—which creates tension with the ruling DPP. The KMT and Taiwan People’s Party hold a legislative majority, giving them strong influence over budget and legislation. Cheng emphasizes promoting regional peace and preventing Taiwan from becoming a geopolitical sacrifice. However, allegations of Chinese interference, including over 1,000 TikTok videos and 23 YouTube accounts linked to external sources, have emerged, with the DPP accusing the KMT of failing to protect Taiwan’s safety. Cheng dismisses these claims as politically motivated, while Beijing maintains the election is a domestic matter and denies official involvement.",
