  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats across key states such as Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are reactivating abortion rights as a central campaign issue to counter Republican anti-abortion positions. Despite a broader focus on affordability, Democratic candidates like Abigail Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi are using personal narratives and policy arguments to emphasize reproductive rights, with Spanberger running ads that include former President Barack Obama to reinforce pro-choice messaging. Virginia, the only Southern state without abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade, is a key battleground where Democrats aim to pass a constitutional ballot measure enshrining abortion rights. Republican candidates, including Winsome Earle-Sears and Jack Ciattarelli, are attempting to downplay abortion as a central issue, emphasizing state consensus. The article highlights how past actions by figures like Donald Trump—such as cutting Medicaid to Planned Parenthood and scrutinizing mifepristone—have shaped the national debate, and how advocacy groups like Reproductive Freedom for All are investing heavily in state races to advance pro-choice policies. Poll data shows that although abortion is not a top voter concern, trust in Democratic candidates on reproductive rights remains significantly higher, reinforcing the strategic importance of the issue in shaping electoral outcomes.",
