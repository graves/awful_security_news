  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Unauthorized political messages praising Hamas and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were broadcast through public address systems at four North American airports—Harrisburg (PA), Kelowna (BC), Victoria (BC), and Windsor (ON)—on October 17, 2025. The breaches were attributed to third-party access, possibly exploiting cloud-based software vulnerabilities, leading to operational disruptions, confusion among passengers, and investigations by federal agencies including the U.S. FAA, Transport Canada, and Canadian law enforcement. While no physical security threats were found, officials raised alarms about the potential for such hacks to serve as entry points into larger systems, especially amid a broader wave of cyberattacks on the aviation sector. The incidents highlight serious vulnerabilities in airport infrastructure and the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures in critical public systems.",
