  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has formally renounced his royal titles, including Duke of York, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and Royal Knight Companion of the Garter, in a statement released by Buckingham Palace. This decision follows renewed public scrutiny over his alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein and sexual assault allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein and had a sexual encounter with Andrew when she was 17. The allegations intensified after a 2019 BBC interview in which Andrew made dismissive and insensitive remarks, leading to public backlash, his withdrawal from public duties, and a 2022 settlement in which he acknowledged Epstein as a sex trafficker and Giuffre as a victim. The situation has been further complicated by controversy surrounding his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who faced backlash after a leaked email described Epstein as a 'supreme friend.' Financial instability and connections to a suspected Chinese spy, Tengbo Yang, have also fueled criticism. The decision to relinquish titles marks a significant symbolic and public reckoning with past associations and reflects growing societal demands for accountability within the royal family.",
