  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major AWS outage began at 07:11 GMT due to a flawed technical update to DynamoDB’s API in AWS’s Virginia data center, which triggered a DNS failure and caused widespread disruption across 113 services. This included major platforms such as Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, financial apps like Venmo, and news organizations like The New York Times. The root cause was identified as human error, not a cyberattack. AWS responded quickly, with all services restored by 10:11 GMT, though some users faced delays. The incident underscores the critical dependence of modern digital services—ranging from banking and gaming to media and smart home devices—on centralized cloud infrastructure, and highlights the importance of robust error-handling and redundancy in such systems.",
