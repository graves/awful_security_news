  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s role as lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Prosecutors argue that this creates a conflict of interest and potential disqualification, citing 'quarantined evidence' of communications between the two. Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos in question were unclassified at the time they were shared and that a later upclassification does not alter their original status. He cites a Justice Department inspector general report finding no evidence of classified leaks. Legal experts warn that a lawyer who is also a witness in a case violates fundamental ethical rules, and the dispute underscores tensions between prosecutorial actions and the defense's claim of factual inaccuracy and ethical breach.",
