    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old man, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula shot Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter during a public greeting in Handlova, injuring Fico severely in the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The court found Cintula guilty of terrorism, not just murder or attack, citing his intent to target a political figure specifically due to opposition to Fico’s policies.",
    "Cintula stated he wanted to harm Fico but not kill him, claiming he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, which he said damaged Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The verdict highlighted deep societal divisions in Slovakia, particularly between Prime Minister Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition.",
    "The opposition accuses Fico of undermining democratic standards, media freedom, and covering up corruption, while Fico blames the opposition for creating societal anger leading to the attack.",
    "The court cited Cintula’s own stated motive in supporting the terrorism verdict, noting that the attack targeted a public official with political significance.",
    "Cintula, a former mine worker, writer, and public activist, argued that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism and requested a lighter sentence.",
    "Fico, who has since returned to public life and work, has stated he has forgiven Cintula despite ongoing health issues.",
    "The sentence was less than the maximum life imprisonment, indicating a legal distinction between terrorism and mere political violence."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, shot Fico five times from a distance of over one meter, seriously injuring him. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack constituted terrorism due to its targeted nature against a political leader, citing Cintula’s stated opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. While Cintula claims he did not intend to kill, the court found that the political motivation and targeting of a high-ranking official met the threshold for terrorism. The verdict underscores deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming the opposition for fueling public anger, while opposition parties accuse Fico of undermining democracy. Fico has since returned to public duties and has expressed forgiveness toward Cintula. The sentence, though less than life imprisonment, reflects a legal determination that political violence aimed at a leader is terrorism.",
