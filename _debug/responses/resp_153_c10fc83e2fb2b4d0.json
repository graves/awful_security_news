    "President Donald Trump claimed that each boat struck off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 American lives, based on the premise that the boats were carrying fentanyl.",
    "There is no evidence provided by the Trump administration about the type, quantity, or origin of drugs on the boats.",
    "Drug experts state that Venezuela plays a minor role in drug trafficking to the United States, and most illicit fentanyl enters the U.S. via Mexico through official border crossings, primarily smuggled by U.S. citizens.",
    "The claim that five boat strikes would have saved 125,000 lives contradicts CDC data showing over 73,000 drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025 — meaning the number of lives claimed to be saved exceeds the actual number of deaths in a year.",
    "The statement is factually incorrect because drug seizures do not equate to lives saved due to supply chain replacement and individual variability in drug tolerance.",
    "Legal experts questioned the legality of the strikes under international maritime law and human rights conventions, and the actions contradict longstanding U.S. military practices.",
    "Aerial videos shared by Trump on Truth Social show boat strikes but no visible bags of drugs, undermining the claim that fentanyl was being smuggled.",
    "PolitiFact has previously fact-checked similar claims by politicians and concluded that translating drug seizures into lives saved is not scientifically valid due to lack of data and variability in lethality."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump claimed that each military strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 American lives, asserting that the boats carried fentanyl. However, experts and data from the CDC show that over 73,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S. between May 2024 and April 2025, meaning the claimed 125,000 lives saved would exceed the total number of deaths in a year. The administration provided no evidence of the type or quantity of drugs on the boats, and expert analysis indicates that drug seizures do not equate to lives saved due to supply chain replacement and individual variability in drug tolerance. Additionally, the legality of the strikes is questioned under international maritime law, and the claim that Venezuela plays a significant role in drug trafficking is contradicted by data showing most fentanyl enters the U.S. from Mexico. PolitiFact rates Trump’s statement as false due to lack of evidence, factual inaccuracy, and flawed methodology.",
