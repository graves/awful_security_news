  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, is demanding accountability from federal officials over alleged violations of her order restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests against immigration enforcement in Chicago. The Trump administration's Operation Midway Blitz, which resulted in over 1,000 arrests between September 8 and October 3, 2025, has sparked public protests centered at the Broadview ICE facility. Judge Ellis has issued a sweeping order requiring body-worn cameras and warning before force is used, but reports show agents may have deployed tear gas without warning. Officials including CBP Deputy Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Shawn Byers testified, denying the use of tear gas, while the judge expressed concern that her order is not being followed and ordered further testimony from key figures like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino. Despite these efforts, protests continue, with over 100 demonstrators and 15 arrests reported in recent weekends, showing sustained public resistance to immigration enforcement actions.",
