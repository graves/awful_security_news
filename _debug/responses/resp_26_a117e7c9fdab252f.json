  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions—specifically, surrendering parts of the Donbas region—to end the war, contradicting earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. European officials described the meeting as tense and confrontational, noting Trump raised his voice and grew frustrated, while Ukrainian sources called it a constructive dialogue. Trump later clarified that a ceasefire should be established along current battle lines, which Zelensky endorsed, and denied asking Ukraine to give up the entire Donbas. This shift reflects Trump’s evolving approach to peace, influenced by his recent success in ending the Gaza conflict and concerns over winter casualties. The meeting occurred after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a territorial swap involving eastern Donbas and southern Ukrainian regions, further emphasizing the complexity of negotiations. Despite disagreements, both leaders acknowledged that the discussion could help bring the war closer to an end.",
