  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is facing mounting criticism for its unauthorized military strikes in the Caribbean, targeting alleged drug-carrying submarines, and for releasing two survivors — one from Colombia and one from Ecuador — without providing public evidence of their involvement in drug trafficking or imminent threat to U.S. lives. These actions are seen as legally dubious, with experts questioning whether the administration has the authority to invoke war-like powers without congressional approval. The decision to release the survivors undermines the narrative of a war on narco-terrorists and raises concerns about due process, transparency, and diplomatic credibility, especially in light of skepticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Jack Goldsmith. The lack of evidence, combined with the absence of legal justification, has led to growing bipartisan concern in Congress, with several senators calling for a formal investigation and renewed debate over the legality and morality of these operations.",
