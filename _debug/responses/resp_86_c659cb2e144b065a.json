  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 19, 2025, that he would end all U.S. payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to stop drug production despite years of financial support. The move follows months of escalating diplomatic tensions over drug trafficking, migration, and U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean. Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer, has been a key U.S. ally in security, receiving billions in annual aid. Trump's statement, which included personal attacks on Petro, drew a sharp rebuttal from the Colombian leader who invoked Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez’s work to criticize U.S. cultural ignorance. Meanwhile, the U.S. conducted several military strikes on suspected drug vessels, killing all on board in some cases, further straining relations. The dispute reflects broader geopolitical tensions between U.S. foreign policy and regional sovereignty, particularly in Latin America.",
