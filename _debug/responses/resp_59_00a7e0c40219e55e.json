  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a pivotal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump signaled improved diplomatic relations and suggested a ceasefire along current battle lines, while simultaneously threatening to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles—a move that could escalate the war. Though Trump acknowledged the potential for escalation, he also emphasized a desire to end the conflict without such weapons. The threat is largely symbolic due to logistical, financial, and political constraints. Meanwhile, Ukraine has held key ground despite Russian summer offensives, demonstrating resilience through effective drone warfare. This has created pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military campaign has failed to achieve breakthroughs and faces economic and political instability. As Zelensky pivots from advocating for NATO membership to promoting Ukrainian drone technology, the war’s dynamics are shifting, with the international support structure increasingly favoring Ukraine. The Kremlin’s long-term strategy now faces uncertainty, especially as global allies like India begin to distance themselves from Russia, and Putin’s next move remains unclear.",
