Despite being a US citizen and with advocacy from human rights groups like Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP) and US lawmakers, including Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, he remains detained. Israel is the only country known to prosecute children in military courts, and at least 79 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli jails since October 2023 due to lack of medical care and torture. The case has gained renewed attention following the Gaza ceasefire deal and prisoner exchanges, prompting calls for the US to use its leverage to secure his release.
