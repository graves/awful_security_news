  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a nationwide 'No Kings' protest movement opposed to Donald Trump's policies and leadership style led to Republican governors in Texas and Virginia activating their state National Guard units. The protests, which organizers claim have drawn over five million participants in past events, are framed as a challenge to Trump's 'authoritarianism' and a rejection of rule by absolute power. While organizers assert peaceful intentions, Trump allies have linked the protests to Antifa, prompting security concerns. Critics, including Democrats like Gene Wu, have condemned the deployment of National Guard troops as an overreach and an act of suppressing free speech, likening it to dictator-like behavior. This reflects a broader political and societal tension over protest rights, state security, and ideological conflict in the United States.",
