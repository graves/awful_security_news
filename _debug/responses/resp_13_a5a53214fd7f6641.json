The toll records, which only capture call timing, duration, and numbers, were obtained through routine legal procedures and were limited to the four days immediately before and after the Capitol riot. Smith’s legal team asserts that the data collection was narrowly tailored and justified by the goal of verifying reports that Trump and his allies attempted to contact senators to delay election certification. The records were disclosed in the 2024 indictment of Donald Trump and in Smith’s official report, and similar data was obtained in unrelated investigations involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez, underscoring the legitimacy of such practices. Republican senators raised concerns during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing the FBI and Smith of political weaponization, especially in light of the timing and scope of the indictments.",
