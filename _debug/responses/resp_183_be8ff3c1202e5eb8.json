  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US Vice President JD Vance arrives in Israel as part of a broader diplomatic effort to sustain the 12-day Gaza ceasefire, which began on 10 October 2025. The ceasefire is under threat after a Hamas attack killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli air strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner also held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging progress on long-term peace negotiations, including the establishment of an interim Palestinian government, troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. Israel has not agreed to these talks until Hamas returns all deceased hostages, a condition currently met by only 13 of 28 identified bodies. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid from the UN's World Food Programme has been severely restricted, with only two crossings open and food supplies insufficient for the north. Hamas has reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire and hostage return, while US President Donald Trump has issued strong warnings that Hamas would be 'eradicated' if it breaches the agreement. The fragile peace effort underscores the deep political, military, and humanitarian challenges facing the region.",
