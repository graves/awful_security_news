  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO, during a 2022 deep-sea research expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia, discovered two new species: a semi-transparent porcelain crab about 1.5cm long found at 122m depth, and a glowing West Australian Lantern Shark up to 40cm long discovered over 600m below sea level. These discoveries are part of Australia’s ongoing efforts to explore its vast, uncharted marine environments—known for their unique biodiversity. The findings highlight the importance of deep-sea exploration and underscore that despite Australia's status as a global biodiversity hotspot, thousands of species remain unknown. Scientists estimate up to 600 more species may still be described due to the lengthy process of verification and classification.",
