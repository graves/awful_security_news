  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a decisive 31-0 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs exploited a strategic ruse by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who loudly shouted a curse phrase to deceive the Raiders into relaxing, allowing a successful play to follow. The Chiefs, who held the ball for 42 minutes and recorded 434 yards, finished off a dominant drive with Kareem Hunt’s first down and a touchdown. In contrast, the Raiders struggled with injuries to key players including Maxx Crosby, Brock Bowers, Jakobi Meyers, and Adam Butler, and performed poorly offensively with just three first downs and 96 yards. Despite a strong effort from Chiefs players like Travis Kelce, Xavier Worthy, and Rashee Rice, the Raiders were unable to mount a meaningful response, marking their worst offensive performance in franchise history and their most lopsided loss to the Chiefs in over a century of rivalry.",
