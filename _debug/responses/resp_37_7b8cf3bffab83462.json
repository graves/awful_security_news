  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products due to claims that its use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism or ADHD in children. Despite pressure from the Trump administration and the Informed Consent Action Network, which filed a citizen petition urging the FDA to add warnings, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children and a 2025 analysis of 46 studies—has not established a causal link between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA maintains that no clear evidence exists and has not updated its safety information. Meanwhile, health authorities in the EU, UK, and Canada confirm that acetaminophen remains safe during pregnancy. The controversy stems from a false claim by President Donald Trump that Tylenol use increases autism risk, which has been widely disputed by medical professionals and research.",
