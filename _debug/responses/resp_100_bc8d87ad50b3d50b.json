  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On Saturday, October 18, 2025, millions of Americans are expected to participate in large-scale, peaceful protests organized by the No Kings movement, which criticizes President Trump's leadership style and policies. The movement argues that Trump behaves more like a monarch than an elected official, citing issues such as immigration detentions by ICE, cuts to education and environmental protections, and gerrymandering. The protests follow a major June demonstration that drew over 5 million people, in response to a military parade held on Trump’s 79th birthday, which No Kings viewed as a display of vanity. Despite criticism from Republican leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and governors Glenn Youngkin and Greg Abbott—both of whom have condemned the protests as anti-American or violent—organizers stress that the demonstrations are peaceful and aimed at fostering community solidarity. In response to the protests, Virginia and Texas have mobilized their National Guards, reflecting political and security tensions around the events.",
