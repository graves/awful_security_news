  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York prison guard, Robert Brooks, died after being violently beaten by correctional officers upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024. The incident, captured on silent body-camera footage showing guards punching, stomping, and lifting Brooks by the neck, sparked national outrage. A jury found David Kingsley guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter, while Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges. The prosecution argued that all guards acted as a gang with a 'depraved indifference to human life,' and that the violence was systemic. William Fitzpatrick, the special prosecutor, took over due to recusal by Attorney General Letitia James, who was representing guards in civil cases. The case is part of a broader pattern of abuse, as Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards involved in the March 1, 2025, beating and death of Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility. Six of 10 guards indicted were charged with murder; five pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and three more have agreed to reduced charges and are cooperating. The incident raises serious concerns about prison guard accountability, use of body-cameras, and systemic abuse in correctional facilities.",
