  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump are refusing to negotiate on extending ACA health care subsidies, insisting the government must reopen first. Senate Democrats are blocking a House-passed reopening bill to pressure Republicans into talks. Key federal programs like WIC and Head Start face funding cuts, and federal workers face unpaid paychecks. A planned White House lunch meeting with Republican senators is seen as a display of unity rather than a path to resolution. Both parties remain entrenched, with Democrats urging Trump to take a more active role and Republicans maintaining a unified stance. The approaching Nov. 1 ACA enrollment deadline intensifies concerns about rising health care costs and difficult coverage decisions for millions of Americans.",
