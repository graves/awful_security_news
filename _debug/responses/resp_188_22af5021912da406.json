  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the aftermath of Prince Andrew's removal from royal titles due to his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which has significantly impacted his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lost her duchess title and faced public backlash over a 2011 email in which she referred to Epstein as her 'supreme friend'. As a result, charities have dropped her as a patron, and her business and charitable ventures are now at risk. Despite the scandal, Sarah Ferguson has maintained resilience and is seen as a 'survivor' of royal life, having been reaccepted by the monarchy and rejoining royal events. In contrast, her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie retain their princess titles and are not directly affected by the scandal, though their positions in the royal succession are considered marginal. The article emphasizes that the personal and public fallout primarily affects Prince Andrew, while the daughters remain relatively protected, admired, and in the public eye as loyal and dignified figures. The broader implications highlight a shift in how the royal family handles scandal, reputation, and legacy, especially in light of public scrutiny and evolving standards.",
