  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk is experiencing a major boardroom shake-up, with seven members—including chairman Helge Lund and vice-chairman Henrik Poulsen—resigning due to a disagreement with its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, over the extent of governance changes. The foundation, which holds significant voting power despite a minority equity stake, has advocated for a more extensive reconfiguration, including the removal of former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. The leadership transition is set to be led by Lars Rebien Sorensen, a former CEO with deep company ties. This comes amid broader challenges, including rising competition from Eli Lilly, declining share prices, and a recent warning on profit growth due to market pressures. Despite earlier dominance as Europe’s most-valued company, the company now faces instability in governance and market uncertainty, signaling potential risks to long-term sustainability.",
