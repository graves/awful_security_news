  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims in October 2025 linking autism to circumcision and the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol), citing two studies — a 2013 cross-national analysis and a 2015 Danish study — that show only weak correlations. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, emphasize that neither study proves causation, both have significant methodological flaws including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use, and correlation does not imply causation. The 2025 preprint from WPLab, which Kennedy cited, is unpeer-reviewed and promotes a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, contradicting the scientific consensus. Decades of research confirm acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately. The Health and Human Services Department has clarified that Kennedy’s claims are based on misleading and unverified research.",
