  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has responded to growing backlash from Hollywood studios, unions, and talent agencies by updating its Sora 2 AI tool with new consent-based policies. The AI platform, which allows users to generate hyperrealistic videos from text prompts, has been used to create unauthorized and often inappropriate content involving real people—such as Martin Luther King Jr. changing his speech, Robin Williams talking on a park bench, or Michael Jackson rapping and stealing chicken nuggets. These videos have sparked outrage from family members, including Robin Williams’ daughter Zelda, who called the content 'disgusting, over-processed hotdogs' and a violation of human dignity. Talent agencies like United Talent Agency and Creative Artists Agency, along with SAG-AFTRA, have condemned the practice as exploitation and have pushed for federal legislation, such as the 'NO FAKES Act,' to require consent, credit, and compensation for the use of real people's likenesses. OpenAI has now implemented an 'opt-in' policy, blocking the public generation of well-known characters and agreeing to remove existing non-compliant content, such as videos of Martin Luther King Jr. The issue raises broader ethical and legal questions about AI, intellectual property, and the rights of individuals, especially those who are deceased or public figures, in a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence.",
