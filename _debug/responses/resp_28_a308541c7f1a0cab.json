  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as President Donald Trump unveiled a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom project set to replace the historic space traditionally used by first ladies. The new ballroom, featuring gold and crystal design elements, will seat 650 people—more than three times the capacity of the East Room—and is part of a broader effort to modernize and personalize the White House according to Trump’s aesthetic and political vision. The project, funded by Trump and private donors, is framed as fulfilling a 15-year ambition, with no zoning restrictions reportedly cited. While officials like Karoline Leavitt and Steven Cheung have defended the changes as necessary modernization and historic precedent, the renovation has drawn public criticism and comparisons to past structural overhauls, such as during the Truman administration, when the White House underwent a full reconstruction due to structural risks. The construction has been linked to Trump’s broader renovations, including gold decorations in the Oval Office and paving over the Rose Garden, highlighting a pattern of transforming the White House to reflect his private club style and political identity.",
