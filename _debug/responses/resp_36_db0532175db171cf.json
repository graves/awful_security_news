    "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to administer the oath of office to newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva.",
    "Johnson claims he is following a precedent set by Nancy Pelosi, delaying swearing-in until the House returns from recess, but the lawsuit argues this violates the Constitution, which requires elected members to be sworn in upon meeting qualification standards.",
    "The lawsuit contends that the Constitution does not grant the Speaker authority to delay swearing-in and that Johnson’s actions are politically motivated, specifically to delay a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and to strengthen leverage in budget negotiations.",
    "Grijalva, who won her election in late September, has not spoken to Johnson and is attempting to schedule a meeting to resolve the dispute directly.",
    "The suit seeks a court order allowing a qualified third party to administer the oath to Grijalva if Johnson refuses, asserting that the delay harms both her ability to serve and Arizona’s representation in Congress.",
    "The case raises constitutional questions about the role of the Speaker in appointing or delaying the swearing-in of members, and the balance between procedural precedent and constitutional mandate."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to administer the oath of office to newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires all duly elected members to be sworn in and that Johnson’s delay—based on his assertion of following a precedent set by Nancy Pelosi—is unconstitutional and politically motivated, particularly to delay a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and to strengthen his position in budget negotiations. Despite Johnson’s claim that he will administer the oath upon the House’s return to session, the suit asserts that no valid reason exists for delay and seeks a court order allowing another qualified official to administer the oath. The case raises important constitutional questions about the Speaker’s authority, the rights of elected officials, and the balance of democratic representation at the federal level.",
