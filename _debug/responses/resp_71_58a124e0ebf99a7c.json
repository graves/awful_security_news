    "The mysterious diffuse gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way has long been a subject of debate between two theories: pulsars (old stars) and dark matter annihilation.",
    "New supercomputer simulations show that dark matter — specifically, WIMPs — could produce a squashed, egg-shaped distribution at the galactic center, matching the observed shape of the gamma-ray glow.",
    "The shape of dark matter in the galaxy, previously assumed to be spherical, is now found to be elongated or squashed, aligning better with the Fermi telescope data than earlier models suggested.",
    "While the dark matter hypothesis is not yet confirmed, the new study increases its credibility, with Joseph Silk estimating a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter compared to old stars.",
    "A new instrument, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to launch in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data capable of distinguishing between dark matter and pulsar origins.",
    "The search for WIMPs remains a central effort in physics, with experiments like the LZ Dark Matter Experiment in South Dakota designed to detect annihilation signals from these particles.",
    "Despite decades of searching, dark matter has never been directly observed, and its nature remains one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in modern physics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new simulation using supercomputers has revived the possibility that the mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way — first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008 — could be caused by dark matter annihilation. Previously, the glow's shape resembled the galactic bulge, which favored pulsar explanations, but new models show that dark matter, specifically WIMPs, could produce a squashed, egg-shaped distribution matching the data. While the study does not confirm dark matter, it increases the credibility of the theory, with researchers like Joseph Silk suggesting a 50% chance it is correct. The outcome will be tested by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to launch in 2027, which will detect gamma rays at higher resolution. This work highlights the enduring mystery of dark matter — a fundamental component of the universe never directly observed — and keeps the WIMP hypothesis central to ongoing scientific efforts.",
