    "Iceland, long thought to be mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The mosquitoes were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason during dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The species Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing adults to survive winter in sheltered areas.",
    "This is the first recorded instance of mosquitoes thriving in the natural environment of Iceland, unlike a previous isolated case found on an airplane in 1990s-era reports.",
    "Possible introduction routes include ships or containers, with ongoing monitoring needed to assess long-term survival and establishment.",
    "Climate change may increase the potential for other mosquito species to establish in Iceland, though experts remain cautious about attributing the discovery directly to global warming.",
    "Mosquitoes are expanding their range globally due to warming temperatures, making such events significant for understanding climate change impacts on ecosystems.",
    "Iceland has already experienced record-breaking heat due to climate change, which may contribute to environmental shifts allowing mosquitoes to survive."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long protected from mosquitoes by its extreme cold, has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós near Reykjavík in October 2025. The insects, adapted to cold climates, were found by Björn Hjaltason and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson. While a single mosquito was previously found on an airplane, this marks the first natural occurrence in the country. Experts debate the role of climate change in this event, noting that warming temperatures may increase the potential for future mosquito establishment, though it is not certain this discovery was directly caused by global warming. The finding underscores broader ecological shifts due to climate change and raises questions about the future of insect distribution in extreme environments.",
