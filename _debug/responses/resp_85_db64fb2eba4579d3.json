  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric by threatening to allow Israel to resume military operations against Hamas in Gaza if the group continues killing civilians, marking a sharp reversal from his earlier claims that the war was effectively over. Despite clarifying that U.S. forces would not be directly involved, Trump emphasized that nearby actors would carry out action under U.S. authority. This comes amid reports that Hamas has used the ceasefire to reassert control in Gaza, targeting Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. Trump previously dismissed such actions as minor, but now insists Hamas must disarm or face consequences, and he expressed confidence that the ceasefire will hold, though he remains prepared to act if it is violated.",
