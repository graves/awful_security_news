  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith have rebutted claims by Republican lawmakers that investigators in the January 6 Capitol riot probe conducted politically motivated wiretaps on GOP members of Congress. The toll records obtained — which only include call duration, timing, and numbers, not content — were collected between January 4 and 7, 2021, to investigate whether President Trump or his surrogates attempted to contact senators to delay certification of the 2020 election results. Smith’s attorneys argue that the collection was narrowly tailored, lawful, and consistent with standard investigative procedures, and that similar toll records were used in other investigations involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez. The controversy emerged during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, where Republicans accused the FBI and Smith of political weaponization, while Democrats questioned the broader implications of recent indictments against political adversaries.",
