Protesters from cities like New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Portland, and smaller towns expressed fears over executive overreach, the deployment of the National Guard, cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid, and the targeting of immigrants. Despite a largely peaceful turnout, some incidents of violence were reported. The protests emphasized nonviolence, unity (symbolized by yellow and costumes), and a return to democratic values. Key figures such as Senator Raphael Warnock, Bill Nye, and Bernie Sanders amplified the message, linking economic inequality and billionaire power to democratic collapse. The demonstrations reflect a national awakening to concerns about the future of American democracy and public trust in government.",
