  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration’s request to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, overturning a prior district court decision. However, because a second restraining order remains in effect, immediate deployment is blocked. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is criticized by former Clinton appointee Judge Susan P. Graber as undermining state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. Governor Tina Kotek of Oregon and Attorney General Dan Rayfield have voiced strong opposition, calling for an en banc review of the ruling. The broader context includes legal challenges in other cities—such as Chicago and Memphis—where similar deployments are being contested on constitutional and statutory grounds. Trump has repeatedly invoked the Insurrection Act to justify troop use in cities like San Francisco, Chicago, and Memphis, sparking public backlash and nationwide protests, including the 'No Kings' rally. Multiple state officials and senators have raised concerns about the legality, constitutional implications, and impact on military readiness of these domestic troop deployments.",
