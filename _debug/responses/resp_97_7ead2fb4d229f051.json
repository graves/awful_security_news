  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The rise of Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 New York Democratic primary marks a turning point for democratic socialism in American politics. As a candidate from the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Mamdani has become a symbol of a broader political shift, with the DSA seeing record membership growth—reaching 80,000 members—driven by widespread public support for socialist policies such as 'FREEZE THE RENT,' 'CHILDCARE FOR ALL,' and single-payer healthcare. This surge follows a Gallup poll from September 2024, which found that 66% of Democrats view socialism positively, while only 42% view capitalism favorably. The DSA’s strong stance on Palestinian liberation, especially in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks, has helped define its identity and appeal, though it has also created internal divisions, including the censure of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over her support for Zionism. Despite these tensions, other progressive candidates like Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson are using Mamdani’s success as a model to build grassroots campaigns, signaling a growing demand among voters for bold, working-class-centered political leadership. This moment reflects a broader dissatisfaction with establishment Democrats and a desire for more radical, inclusive, and effective political action.",
