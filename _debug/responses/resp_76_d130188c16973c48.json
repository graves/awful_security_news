The upcoming five-year plan emphasizes innovation in AI, quantum computing, and green energy, while also signaling internal reforms to address domestic imbalances. Simultaneously, the plenum marks a significant political shift with the removal of top military officials like He Weidong and Miao Hua, reinforcing Xi’s anti-corruption drive and consolidation of power within the Communist Party and People’s Liberation Army. Analysts expect continuity in Xi’s policies, though minor adjustments may focus on boosting consumption and curbing internal competition, underscoring the balance between economic pragmatism and political control.",
