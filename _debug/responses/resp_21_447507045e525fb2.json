This is distinct from the 2018–2019 partial shutdown, which lasted 35 days—the longest in nearly 50 years—and cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The 2018 shutdown affected about 800,000 federal workers, with 300,000 furloughed and 300,000 exempt. Political obstacles, including Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's narrow House majority and the Senate filibuster rule, have made bipartisan compromise difficult. The current shutdown underscores broader challenges in U.S. legislative politics, where partisan divisions prevent timely funding decisions, impacting public services and economic stability.",
