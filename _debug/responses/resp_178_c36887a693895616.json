Over 300 people contacted the BBC with stories of mistreatment, including officers telling victims they were exaggerating, dismissing rape allegations, or mocking their experiences â€” with black women facing compounded bias. Victims described being re-traumatised, with some saying reporting abuse felt like being raped again. The National Police Chiefs' Council and College of Policing responded by emphasizing reforms in training, vetting, and misconduct procedures, including the use of the Domestic Abuse Matters programme. Government officials, including Policing Minister Sarah Jones and NPCC lead Helen Millichap, affirmed efforts to build a more empathetic and accountable police culture, while survivors stressed that systemic failures have persisted for decades.",
