  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef combining marine art and coral restoration. The project, led by artist Ximena Caminos and coral expert Colin Foord, will feature 22 concrete cars and other sculptures arranged in the ocean off Miami Beach, designed to support the growth of resilient corals like gorgonians. These corals will eventually transform the sculptures into vibrant underwater ecosystems, restoring a reef that was lost in the 1970s. The project is funded by a $5 million city bond and seeks $6 million more in public funding. It will be accessible to swimmers in 15–20 feet of water and includes a marine learning center to educate the public. Over time, the coral will colonize the structures, with future phases including 57 giant starfish sculptures that may become a symbolic landmark for Miami Beach. The initiative blends art, science, and environmental restoration, aiming to revive both marine biodiversity and cultural identity in the city.",
