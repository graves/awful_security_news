  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is sourcing cattle from illegal deforestation zones in Brazil’s Pará state — including protected Indigenous and sustainable development areas — through a supply chain lacking individual animal traceability. The report highlights that cattle are transported via a 'laundering' system using group-level transit permits (GTAs) that do not track individual origins, making it impossible for JBS to verify whether its beef comes from illegal ranching. Despite previous promises under the G4 Cattle Agreement (2009), JBS has failed to implement effective supplier traceability. The state of Pará has seen a 421% increase in deforestation in 2024, with violence and land grabs threatening Indigenous communities. While new policy measures — such as Pará’s 2026 traceability decree and the federal government’s 2032 tracking mandate — are in place, experts warn they are too slow and insufficient. The article calls for stronger government oversight, public access to GTA data, and accountability for corporate supply chains to halt deforestation and protect vulnerable communities.",
