The plane was attempting a visual approach to runway 7 at an airport near Franklin, North Carolina, where James had requested a landing. Despite being instructed to tune to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), he did not change the frequency and instead announced a 360-degree turn at 6,800 feet. After flying over the runway and descending, the plane entered a spiral and crashed, killing all three people on board. The NTSB found no mechanical issues in the wreckage, pointing to a communication failure and possible pilot error as the root cause.",
