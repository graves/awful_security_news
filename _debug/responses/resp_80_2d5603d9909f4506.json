  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A bomb exploded outside the home of Sigfrido Ranucci, host of Italy’s leading investigative journalism program 'Report,' in Campo Ascolano, south of Rome, damaging two vehicles and a nearby house but injuring no one. Ranucci, who has long faced threats due to his critical reporting, said the attack occurred about 20 minutes after returning home. The incident has prompted condemnation from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who emphasized the importance of press freedom, and led to an investigation by anti-Mafia prosecutors into possible mafia-style methods. The 'Report' program has a history of clashing with Meloni’s government, resulting in legal actions from several coalition members, including Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, Industry Minister Adolfo Urso, and cabinet head Gaetano Caputi, as well as the Brothers of Italy party. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has increased police protection for Ranucci. The attack underscores broader tensions between investigative journalism and political power in Italy.",
