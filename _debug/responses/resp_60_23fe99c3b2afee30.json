  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. is experiencing a full government shutdown due to Congress failing to pass the required 12 appropriations bills, marking a continuation of political gridlock. The last major shutdown, which began on December 22, 2018, lasted 35 days — the longest in nearly 50 years — and cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. During that event, about 300,000 employees were furloughed and 500,000 were exempted from work but unpaid. This current shutdown reflects deeper institutional challenges, including a narrow Republican majority in Congress, the absence of 60 Senate votes to overcome a filibuster, and a persistent partisan divide that has made bipartisan spending agreements difficult. The shutdown underscores the economic and human costs of political deadlock, with federal operations across all sectors suspended.",
