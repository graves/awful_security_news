  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled due to violent fan riots and public disorder at Bloomfield Stadium, with police reporting injuries to 12 civilians and three officers, and 25 people detained. The unrest, including the use of pyrotechnics and smoke grenades, prompted the police decision to cancel the match to prevent further loss of life. Hapoel criticized the police response, calling it excessive and militarized, while Maccabi remained silent. This incident follows previous security issues, including a ban on Maccabi fans attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in England due to concerns over violence, which drew criticism from UK leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The UK government has since acknowledged the need to understand the Tel Aviv incident and is engaging with Israeli authorities to gain clarity.",
