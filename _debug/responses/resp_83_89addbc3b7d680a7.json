  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending nearly two decades of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The victory comes amid a severe economic crisis marked by inflation, fuel shortages, and declining natural gas exports. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, with his party holding 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate. While the PDC lacks a legislative majority, Paz’s moderate platform—emphasizing private sector growth, regional fiscal autonomy, and gradual reform—resonated with disillusioned left-leaning voters wary of austerity. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal through populist social media outreach. Both candidates pledged to strengthen ties with the United States and seek financial support. Paz has announced plans for a $1.5 billion economic deal with the US and has committed to phasing out universal fuel subsidies, replacing them with targeted support. The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including securing fuel supplies and avoiding labor opposition from the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), which warns of protests over social program threats. Analysts and officials view this election as a transformative turning point in Bolivian democracy, signaling a shift from state-led economic models to market-based reforms and renewed diplomatic engagement with the West.",
