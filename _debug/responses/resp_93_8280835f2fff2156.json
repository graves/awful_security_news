  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 19, 2025, over 7 million people participated in nationwide 'No Kings' protests across the United States, organized by the Indivisible Project to oppose what they perceive as President Donald Trump’s authoritarian agenda. Protesters from diverse backgrounds—including retired workers, federal employees, and activists—gathered in cities like Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Portland, and small towns across the U.S., expressing deep concern over executive overreach, immigration raids, cuts to public services like Medicaid, and the erosion of democracy and free speech. Key figures such as Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Raphael Warnock, and Bill Nye spoke at rallies, reinforcing the message that democracy belongs to the people, not to a ruling elite. The protests emphasized peaceful, nonviolent resistance, with symbols like yellow and costumes used to convey unity and joy. While the demonstrations were largely peaceful, some incidents of harassment—such as a woman brandishing a firearm in South Carolina and a man pushing a protester in Georgia—highlighted the tensions in the political environment. The movement reflects a widespread national anxiety about the future of American democracy, with many participants seeing the current political climate as a threat to civil liberties, public safety, and social equity.",
