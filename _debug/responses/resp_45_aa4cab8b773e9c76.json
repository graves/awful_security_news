  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A North Korean submunition marked with Juche 89 (2000) was discovered in a drone used to attack Ukraine's Kherson port city in September 2024. The submunition, originally designed for rocket artillery, was modified for drone use with basic materials. This discovery, verified by the UK-based investigative group Conflict Armament Research (CAR), establishes a direct material link between North Korea’s defense industry and Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. The report comes amid increased drone attacks by Russia, which has built massive drone factories to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and erode civilian morale. North Korea has also significantly expanded its military presence in Russia, with approximately 12,000 troops deployed, of whom about 4,000 have been killed or wounded. This development underscores the growing international dimension of the war in Ukraine, with North Korea playing a more direct role in the conflict.",
