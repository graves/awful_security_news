  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States has significantly increased its military presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and advanced naval assets including destroyers, submarines, and surveillance aircraft. Key actions include reopening Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, activating AC-130J Ghostrider aircraft with Hellfire missiles, and conducting live-fire and surveillance operations near Venezuela. While the US claims the buildup is part of a counter-drug campaign, analysts suggest it is primarily a pressure campaign aimed at destabilizing Venezuela’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, through signaling, airstrikes (e.g., Tomahawk missiles), and show of force. Experts note that the scale of deployment does not support a full invasion, but it does indicate a strategic escalation of military operations in the region, particularly in response to political tensions and regional instability.",
