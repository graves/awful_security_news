  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has intensified its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, signaling that military action could be used to remove him from power, despite officially stating its primary goal is to combat drug trafficking. This strategy builds on the 2019 recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, which triggered a major diplomatic rupture with Maduro. The U.S. has since increased its bounty on Maduro to $50 million, deployed military assets to the Caribbean, and authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela. Officials, including former National Security Adviser John Bolton and current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have repeatedly condemned Maduro’s regime as criminal and illegitimate, framing it as a threat to U.S. security through drug trafficking and foreign influence. Although Maduro remains in power and the 2024 election is widely seen as illegitimate, the threat of military force has grown significantly under the Trump administration, blurring the line between counter-narcotics efforts and regime change.",
