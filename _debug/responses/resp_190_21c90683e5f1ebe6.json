  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, is required to testify in a landmark trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court over claims that social media platforms, including Meta-owned Instagram and Snap-owned Snapchat, have designed addictive features that harm youth mental health. The trial, expected in January 2025, consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts alleging inadequate parental controls and harmful notification systems like 'likes.' Judge Carolyn Kuhl rejected Meta’s argument that in-person testimony was unnecessary, stating that CEO testimony is essential to assess knowledge of harm and failure to act. The companies previously relied on a 1990s law to avoid liability for user content, but the judge ruled that claims of negligence and personal injury stemming from app design remain valid. This case is part of a broader trend of legal pressure on social media companies following growing public concern over the mental health impacts of social media on young people, with similar litigation involving TikTok and YouTube. Meta and Snap have contested the claims, but the court’s decision emphasizes accountability at the executive level, with the expectation that the testimony will reveal whether the companies acted negligently despite being aware of risks.",
