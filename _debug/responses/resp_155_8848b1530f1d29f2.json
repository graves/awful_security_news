  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly contributing to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating within protected areas of Pará. The investigation found that cattle raised in illegally deforested zones are transported through a 'laundering' system using group-level transit permits (GTAs), which fail to track individual animals, making it impossible for JBS to verify the legality of its supply chain. Despite past commitments under the G4 Cattle Agreement, JBS has not fulfilled its promise to trace indirect suppliers. The report highlights that Pará has seen a 421% increase in deforestation in 2024 and is a hotspot for land conflicts and violence against Indigenous communities. While Brazil’s federal and state governments have introduced traceability mandates (by 2026 and 2032 respectively), experts warn these timelines are insufficient. Advocacy groups call for stronger enforcement, public access to GTA data, and immediate accountability from companies to prevent further environmental and human rights damage.",
