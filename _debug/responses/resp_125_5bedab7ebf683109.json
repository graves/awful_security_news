  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a significant global outage on October 20, 2025, beginning at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and resolving by 6 p.m. Eastern time. The outage, traced to DNS issues in AWS’s US-EAST-1 region, disrupted a wide range of services including social media (Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and retail apps (McDonald’s), as well as critical educational tools like Canvas. Students at universities such as the University of California, Riverside, and Ohio State University were unable to access coursework or submit assignments. Amazon’s own services, including Ring and Alexa, also failed. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages are typically technical in nature and resolve within hours, though recovery is often slow and bumpy, with potential for smaller disruptions. This incident underscores the growing vulnerability of modern internet infrastructure, which relies heavily on a few major cloud providers, making global systems susceptible to cascading failures when one key service fails.",
