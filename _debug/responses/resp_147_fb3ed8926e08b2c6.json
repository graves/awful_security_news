  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s climate-vulnerable mountain regions, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, heavy rainfall, or using signal fires and gunfire to alert communities—is proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems. Despite a $37 million investment in technology, including the GLOF-II project, residents in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa express deep skepticism due to frequent failures, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. Real-life examples, such as shepherd Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, demonstrate how traditional human-based warnings saved hundreds of lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), while official systems remain untrusted and non-functional. This highlights a critical gap in disaster preparedness: technology must be integrated with local knowledge, trust, and community participation to be effective. As global warming accelerates glacier melt and flooding, Pakistan—ranked among the top 10 climate-vulnerable nations—faces increasing disaster frequency, reinforcing the need to reevaluate and revamp early warning systems with cultural and community-centered approaches.",
