The meeting comes at a critical time as China’s economy slowed to 4.8% growth in Q3 2025, facing internal challenges like overcapacity, deflation, and a property sector slump. A major anti-corruption purge has removed top military officials, including General He Weidong and Miao Hua, signaling Xi’s tightening control over both the military and political apparatus. The plenum may result in significant personnel changes, potentially the largest shake-up since 2017, reinforcing Xi’s centralized authority. Analysts expect minimal deviation from current policy, with only targeted adjustments to boost consumption and reduce domestic competition. This event occurs just before a potential high-level meeting between China and US leaders, underscoring the intensifying global competition in trade, technology, and security.",
