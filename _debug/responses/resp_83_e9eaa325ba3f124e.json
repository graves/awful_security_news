  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement operations in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In response to concerns over excessive force and lack of warning during protests, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for agents, especially when using tear gas or pepper balls. However, ICE Special Response Teams currently lack cameras, and the agency has a revolving leadership structure. A protest incident involving Pastor David Black, who was struck multiple times while praying, raised serious questions about use of force. The judge intends to depose former ICE field office head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts of events. The Trump administration has denied reports of unannounced tear gas use, with an official claiming the judge is relying on biased media. Internal reviews of use-of-force incidents are conducted by ICE leadership and the Office of Professional Responsibility, but the broader public and legal scrutiny underscores tensions between federal enforcement and civil rights during demonstrations.",
