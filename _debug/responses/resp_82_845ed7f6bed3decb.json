  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as President Donald Trump unveils a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom project. The new space, designed with gold finishes, crystal chandeliers, and gilded columns, will seat 650 people—more than three times the current East Room—and is part of a broader effort to modernize and personalize the White House’s design. The initiative fulfills a 15-year ambition by Trump to expand entertaining capacity, echoing the opulent style of his private clubs. The project, funded by Trump and private donors, proceeds without zoning restrictions, with the White House citing historical precedents—like Truman-era renovations due to structural instability—to justify the demolition and construction. Critics have voiced concern, prompting the White House to defend the project with references to past modernizations and to emphasize that the new ballroom will maintain the White House's neoclassical heritage.",
