  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, sparked by Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and advanced technology equipment. This comes just weeks before the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. China justifies its actions as a response to US economic and security restrictions, particularly on its maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Experts note that both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence and national security arguments, with China framing its actions as a strategic pre-emptive move during negotiations and the US using calibrated tariffs to assert leverage. The article traces a history of trade friction, including previous tariff escalations, semiconductor export controls, and targeted sanctions on firms like Huawei and TikTok. While the US holds greater economic resilience, China faces risks due to its export dependence. The situation reflects a deepening strategic competition over critical technologies and resources, with both sides maintaining escalation tools in reserve and the outcome likely depending on market reactions and diplomatic resolve.",
