  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist on October 20, 2025, thieves broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris using power tools and a mechanical lift to access the Galerie d'Apollon, stealing eight 19th-century royal jewels including diadems, necklaces, and brooches. The attackers, believed to be part of an organized criminal group, remained inside for only four minutes before escaping on two scooters. The museum was evacuated, with no injuries reported but significant damage to the Empress Eugénie's crown. French officials, including Culture Minister Rachida Dati and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, condemned the incident as a devastating breach of cultural heritage. The theft has triggered political outrage, with President Emmanuel Macron calling it an 'attack on our history' and political leaders like Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen describing it as an 'intolerable humiliation' and a 'wound to the French soul'. Experts warn that stolen items will likely be dismantled and sold in parts to evade detection. This incident follows a broader trend of museum thefts in France, including recent cases at the Adrien Dubouche, Cognacq-Jay, and Hieron museums. The Louvre remains closed as investigations continue, and officials are reviewing security failures, including a broken local alarm in the gallery. A €700–800 million New Renaissance project, aimed at upgrading museum security, is now under renewed scrutiny.",
