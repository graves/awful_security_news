  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator and former political outsider, has won the 2025 Bolivian presidential runoff with 54.5% of the vote, defeating former President Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga, marking Bolivia’s first conservative leadership in decades. This victory comes after nearly two decades of Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) rule and amid a severe economic crisis marked by record inflation, fuel shortages, and a critical U.S. dollar shortage. Paz’s appeal lies with rural and working-class voters, especially Indigenous populations, who are disillusioned with MAS’s economic model and inflation. His running mate, ex-police officer Edman Lara, gained traction through social media activism and anti-corruption messaging. Paz plans to dismantle the fixed exchange rate, end fuel subsidies, and reduce public spending, though critics argue his policies are vague and potentially destabilizing. Despite pledging to avoid IMF bailouts, he faces a difficult path to restore foreign currency reserves and economic stability. The U.S. State Department has welcomed the new administration, signaling a potential revival of diplomatic ties. This election reflects a deep ideological and economic shift in Bolivia, with voters rejecting the MAS legacy and embracing a more market-oriented, conservative approach under Paz’s leadership.",
