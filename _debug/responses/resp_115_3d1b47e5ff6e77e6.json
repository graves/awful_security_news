      "descriptionOfWhyTimeFrameIsRelevant": "The study observed nest development over a 6-day period, during which structural changes in ant colonies were monitored. This timeframe reflects the biological and behavioral response of ants to fungal infection, illustrating how rapid architectural adaptation can occur in response to environmental threats."

    "Ants, particularly black garden ants (Lasius niger), modify their nest architecture in response to a deadly fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, to reduce disease spread.",
    "This behavior includes increased compartmentalization, reduced connectivity between nest chambers, greater spacing of nest entrances, and longer travel routes, all of which limit transmission of infection.",
    "The ants exhibit both social and architectural responses: infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants, especially nurses, increase their distance from foragers — a form of 'proactive social distancing'.",
    "These combined behaviors represent a form of 'architectural immunity', demonstrating that non-human social species can actively modify their physical environments to protect against epidemics.",
    "The study, published in Science, offers new insights into 'social immunity' — a collective defense mechanism in social insects that reduces disease spread without relying solely on individual immune responses.",
    "Evolutionary biologist Sarah Kocher suggests these principles could inform human architectural design, especially in public spaces, to reduce disease transmission by isolating vulnerable individuals and limiting cross-contact."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants — particularly nurses — increase their distance from foragers, demonstrating a form of proactive social distancing. When threatened, the ants also modify their nests by making them more compartmentalized, reducing tunnel connectivity, spacing nest entrances farther apart, and lengthening travel routes. These architectural changes help limit disease transmission, creating a system known as 'architectural immunity'. The research, led by behavioral ecologist Nathalie Stroeymeyt and systems biologist Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, reveals that non-human social species actively modify their environments to combat disease. Evolutionary biologist Sarah Kocher suggests that these principles could inspire better architectural designs for human public spaces to reduce disease spread by isolating vulnerable populations and minimizing contact.",
