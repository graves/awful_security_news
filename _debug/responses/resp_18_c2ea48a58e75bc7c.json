  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the third week of a government shutdown, over 1.4 million federal workers, including contractors and employees from agencies like the Department of Commerce and Social Security Administration, are furloughed or working without pay. In response, a joint food distribution event organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries in Landover, Maryland, served more than 370 households — far exceeding expectations — as federal workers like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams expressed financial distress and a loss of job security. The event required work IDs to verify eligibility, highlighting both the scale of need and the operational realities of aid distribution. Lawmakers remain divided, with GOP Senator Ron Johnson proposing payment only for workers who continue working, while Democrats push for universal compensation. This event underscores the human cost of prolonged government shutdowns, challenging public assumptions about federal employment as a stable source of livelihood.",
