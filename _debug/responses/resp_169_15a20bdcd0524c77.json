  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In early 2025, a wave of AI-powered deepfake voice scams targeted prominent Italian businessmen, with fraudsters impersonating Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request large financial transfers. The scam, which emerged just after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala from Iran, exploited advanced AI voice cloning technology capable of mimicking pitch, accent, and speech patterns so realistically that participants in a research study often mistook AI voices for real ones. Only one businessman, former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti, transferred money, which was later frozen by police. Experts, including Nadine Lavan of Queen Mary University of London, note that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants more likely to trust AI voices. The global rise in deepfake fraud—exceeding $547 million in losses by mid-2025—has prompted policy responses in the US and Australia, including laws banning the distribution of AI-generated intimate images. While AI voice technology has beneficial uses, such as restoring speech for individuals with speech impairments, its misuse in identity theft, fraud, and the creation of harmful content—including child sexual abuse material—poses a growing threat to public safety and trust.",
