  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing mounting pressure to withdraw from the race, including direct appeals from his boss John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC radio. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is uniting with other Republicans to oppose Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and is pushing Sliwa out, arguing he is not a viable alternative. Sliwa, known for founding the Guardian Angels and having no prior political office, has rejected the pressure, asserting that blue-collar voters should have a voice in the election and criticizing billionaire donors like Bill Ackman and former President Donald Trump for shaping political outcomes. Despite criticism from Cuomo and Trump, Sliwa remains committed to the race, with Mamdani and Sliwa forming a rare alliance against donor-driven politics.",
