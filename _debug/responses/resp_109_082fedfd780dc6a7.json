    "Guillermo del Toro, a renowned filmmaker, is creating a modern adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein, which aligns with his established cinematic style of portraying monstrous creatures as deeply human and empathetic.",
    "The film features Jacob Elordi as the Creature, whose evolution from a frightened, emotionally limited being to a complex, emotionally intelligent character mirrors the original novel's themes of growth and self-discovery.",
    "The narrative emphasizes emotional depth and empathy, with the Creature forming bonds with a blind patriarch (David Bradley) and engaging with literature, reflecting the book's intellectual development.",
    "Oscar Isaac plays Victor Frankenstein, portrayed as arrogant, prideful, and emotionally distant, contrasting sharply with the Creature's emotional maturity and moral depth.",
    "Del Toro's version diverges from the original novel by introducing new characters (e.g., Christoph Waltz as Harlander, Christian Convery as young Frankenstein, Mia Goth as Elizabeth) and subplots that add narrative complexity but may dilute the original novel's moral and emotional arc.",
    "The film removes or softens the Creature's more violent or morally ambiguous actions in the original, emphasizing sympathy and victimhood rather than agency or complexity.",
    "A key narrative device — the line 'You are the monster' — is used to emphasize the Creature's humanity and Victor's moral failure, reinforcing del Toro's thematic focus on empathy and injustice.",
    "Del Toro's visual design is highly stylized, with vast, atmospheric settings and gothic architecture that enhance the film's emotional and aesthetic tone.",
    "The film is described as a 'lifelong dream' of del Toro's, reflecting his deep personal and artistic commitment to reimagining the Frankenstein narrative through a humanistic, emotionally resonant lens."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Guillermo del Toro has released a new film adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein, embodying his signature style of portraying the Creature as emotionally intelligent, empathetic, and deeply human. The film features Jacob Elordi as the Creature, who evolves from a fearful, chained being into a compassionate, self-aware figure through emotional and intellectual growth. Oscar Isaac portrays Victor Frankenstein as arrogant and emotionally detached, contrasting with the Creature’s empathy. Del Toro makes several narrative changes, including adding new characters and subplots, which may complicate the original story but enhance emotional depth. The film emphasizes themes of empathy, creation, and moral failure, while visually and thematically diverging from the 1931 Karloff version. Despite some narrative deviations, the film remains faithful to the novel’s core themes, reimagining the Creature as a sympathetic outcast and a moral counterpoint to his creator.",
