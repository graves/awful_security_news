  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a wave of anti-immigrant unrest on October 21, 2025, over 1,000 protesters in southwest Dublin clashed with police after allegations of a sexual assault on a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum seekers. The accused man, an asylum seeker who requested a Romanian interpreter, is under investigation, though his ethnicity is not confirmed. Protesters launched fireworks, burned a police van, and chanted slogans such as 'Irish lives matter' and 'Get them out!'. The Irish government responded with strong condemnation: Prime Minister Micheal Martin described the events as 'extremely serious and very, very grave', and Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan denounced the weaponization of the crime as 'unacceptable'. This incident reflects a broader pattern of anti-immigrant violence in Ireland, seen in past events such as 2023 riots after a knife attack involving a man from Algeria and in 2024 protests in Ballymena over accusations against Romanian youth. The recurring use of immigration-related incidents to fuel public anger indicates a rising societal anxiety about immigration and safety in Ireland, despite the absence of far-right political representation.",
