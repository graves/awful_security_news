  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The viral internet meme '6-7' — pronounced 'six-seveeeeen' — has become a disruptive and widespread phenomenon among Gen Alpha students, particularly in schools across the U.S., where children shout it in response to page numbers, time cues, or simply for fun. Originating from a viral song by Skrilla and popularized by basketball star Taylen Kinney’s TikTok gesture, the phrase has evolved into a social shibboleth, signaling belonging within peer groups. While its meaning remains undefined and subject to interpretation, experts argue that its popularity reflects broader cultural shifts in post-truth communication and youth-driven language innovation. Teachers have responded with both bans and humorous adoption, recognizing that the phrase functions as a form of social bonding. Though some fear it signals declining literacy, experts emphasize that it is a normal part of generational linguistic evolution and not evidence of brainrot. Alternatives like '41' are already emerging, suggesting the meme may soon fade — yet its longevity is attributed to strong adult reactions and the internet’s fascination with nonsense that feels meaningful.",
