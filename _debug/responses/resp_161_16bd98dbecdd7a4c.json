    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, adding five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to the list of restricted materials, bringing the total number of restricted rare-earth elements to 12 out of 17.",
    "The restrictions include export controls on specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, which foreign companies must now obtain special approvals for.",
    "Foreign companies must justify the intended use of products containing rare-earth metals, especially those with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content.",
    "China cites national security and dual-use applications (civilian and military) as the justification for the restrictions, pointing to cases of unauthorized military transfers of Chinese rare-earth materials.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, AI systems, fighter jets (e.g., F-35), submarines, and missile guidance systems.",
    "The United States is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, and sourced 70% of its rare-earth imports from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "The move is seen as a strategic signaling action ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, intended to strengthen China’s negotiating leverage.",
    "The U.S. defence and technology sectors face growing vulnerabilities due to limited domestic production capacity and reliance on Chinese supply chains.",
    "China emphasized that emergency medical needs, disaster relief, and public health emergencies remain exempt from the restrictions.",
    "Analysts, including Gracelin Baskaran from CSIS and Kristin Vekasi from the University of Montana, view this as a calculated move to pressure U.S. trade negotiations and highlight China's supply chain dominance."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened its export controls on rare-earth metals, adding five new metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—to its list of restricted elements, bringing the total to 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals. The restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce and effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals and justify the civilian or military use of products containing rare-earth materials. China justifies the move on national security grounds, citing unauthorized military transfers of Chinese rare-earth materials. The move occurs just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The U.S. is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and relies heavily on these materials for critical technologies, including defence systems like F-35 jets, submarines, and missile guidance, as well as civilian applications like electric vehicles and AI. Analysts interpret the action as a calculated 'pre-meeting choreography' to pressure the U.S. and highlight China’s dominance in the supply chain. The restrictions also include limits on export of refining equipment, and emergency medical and disaster relief uses remain exempt.",
