  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has officially relinquished all royal titles and honors, including the dukedom of York, marking a definitive end to his public role in the British royal family. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles III, Prince William, and other royal family members, follows years of public and political scrutiny over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct. Despite previous steps such as stepping back from public life and losing military titles in 2022, the scandal has persisted through court documents, media revelations, and the upcoming release of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir. New allegations involving an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo, further complicate the narrative. While Andrew retains his status as a prince and has a private tenancy at Royal Lodge, the move is seen as a symbolic distancing from the royal family, though critics argue it is too little, too late. The broader implication is that the monarchy is attempting to protect its reputation by removing a figure perceived as toxic and damaging to its public image.",
