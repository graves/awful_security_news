  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump expressed disappointment over the cancellation of planned face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it a 'wasted meeting' due to Moscow's refusal to accept a ceasefire that would freeze the current front line in Ukraine. While Trump supported a temporary ceasefire along the existing battle line—agreeing with Kyiv and European leaders—Russia maintained its position that such a freeze would only be temporary and that long-term peace requires deeper, maximalist changes like the recognition of Russian sovereignty over the Donbas and demilitarization of Ukraine. The White House cited a 'productive' call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as sufficient to cancel a preparatory meeting, signaling reduced urgency. A key catalyst for Russia's engagement appears to be the US consideration of supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, suggesting that military escalation may be driving diplomatic action. Despite the lack of progress, Trump and Zelensky emphasized that the front line freeze is the necessary first step in diplomacy, and Russian leaders continue to avoid addressing core issues, highlighting deep structural differences in peace proposals.",
