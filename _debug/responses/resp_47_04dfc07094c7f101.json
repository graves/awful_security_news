    "Alex Acosta, former US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and former US Secretary of Labor, defended his 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing that taking the case to trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to unreliable victim testimony and jurisdictional issues.",
    "The plea deal resulted in Epstein serving only 13 months in prison for state-level prostitution charges, widely criticized as a 'sweetheart deal' by victims and advocacy groups.",
    "Acosta stated that all levels of his office, including prosecutors and legal staff, supported the negotiated resolution to ensure Epstein would go to jail, emphasizing that the goal was to send a clear message that sexual exploitation would not be tolerated.",
    "Acosta opposed Epstein’s participation in a work release program, which was granted by the Palm Beach sheriff, and expressed strong frustration over the decision.",
    "Acosta denied any personal involvement in selecting individuals to be interviewed in the Epstein investigation, including Donald Trump, and stated he was unaware of any official documents connecting Trump to Epstein.",
    "A 2002 article from New York Magazine cited Trump calling Epstein a 'terrific guy' and praising his interest in young women, while a 2007 article alleged Epstein tried to recruit girls at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, both of which were presented to Acosta during congressional testimony.",
    "Despite the controversy, Acosta maintained that his actions were consistent with the legal standards and constraints of the time and that he made the decision independently, stating that resigning from the Labor Department was his own choice, not a directive from the White House."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Alex Acosta, the former US Attorney and Secretary of Labor under Donald Trump, defended his 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, asserting that taking the case to trial would have been legally and evidentially unworkable. Acosta testified before the House Oversight Committee, explaining that victims' inconsistent statements, jurisdictional ambiguity, and lack of federal-level evidence made a trial a 'crapshoot.' He emphasized that all levels of his office supported the negotiated resolution to ensure Epstein would go to jail. Despite acknowledging public criticism, Acosta maintained that the decision was based on legal realities and prosecutorial judgment, not political pressure. He denied any personal involvement in selecting interviewees during the investigation, including Donald Trump, and stated he was not aware of any official documents linking Trump to Epstein. The case remains highly controversial, with media reports suggesting past connections between Trump and Epstein, and Acosta's resignation in 2019 underscoring the political sensitivity surrounding the matter.",
