  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mongolia’s president, Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, has vetoed a parliamentary resolution aimed at removing Prime Minister Gombojav Zandanshatar, citing constitutional violations such as a lack of quorum. The move deepens a political crisis rooted in internal party conflict within the ruling Mongolian People’s Party (MPP), where Zandanshatar lost a leadership race to parliamentary speaker Amarbayasgalan Dashzegve. Zandanshatar's policies—particularly a shift in mineral royalty payments to domestic stock prices—have drawn criticism, and his appointment of a justice minister without parliamentary notification has been deemed unlawful. The crisis is part of a broader public unrest in Mongolia driven by corruption and economic instability, despite the nation's natural resource wealth. The constitutional court is set to evaluate the president's veto, signaling a potential legal resolution to the constitutional and political standoff.",
