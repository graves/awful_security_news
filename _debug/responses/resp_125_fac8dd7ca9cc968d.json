Elected after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) suffered major electoral defeats and lost its majority, Takaichi leads a fragile coalition with the Japan Innovation Party, lacking a majority in both houses. Her government is shaped by conservative, nationalist policies, including a strong defense posture, emphasis on the Japan-U.S. alliance, and support for Taiwan. However, her opposition to gender equality, same-sex marriage, and the male-only imperial succession, along with her visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, have drawn criticism from China, South Korea, and LGBTQ+ activists. Despite these concerns, her leadership is seen as a symbol of progress in gender representation. Takaichi faces significant challenges, including economic instability, regional diplomatic tensions, and the need to balance conservative policies with global cooperation, especially during her upcoming meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional leaders.",
