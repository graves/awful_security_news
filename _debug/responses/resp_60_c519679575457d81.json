  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war, particularly demanding surrender of the Donbas region in exchange for Russian-held areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. While European officials described the meeting as tense and frank, Trump later clarified that he only advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the devastation and human cost of the war. Zelensky expressed pessimism about Trump’s position but acknowledged the meeting could move the war closer to an end. Trump’s shift in approach—prioritizing a ceasefire at existing lines after previously suggesting Ukraine could regain all lost territory—reflects a strategic recalibration, possibly influenced by his prior success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. The meeting underscores a growing friction between U.S. and Ukrainian leadership on how to end the war, with both sides pushing for different outcomes: Ukraine seeking a full resolution and Trump advocating a de-escalation focused on the current frontlines.",
