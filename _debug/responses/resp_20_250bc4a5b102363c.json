  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that protests against ICE agents constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president has broad, unreviewable authority to deploy the Guard, citing the 1827 Supreme Court case Martin v. Mott. However, state and local officials in Illinois dispute this, asserting that protests are not riots and that state law enforcement is sufficient. Federal judges, including April Perry and the 7th Circuit, have blocked the deployment, calling the administration’s characterization of events misleading. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a quick decision, which could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the U.S. in response to civil unrest.",
