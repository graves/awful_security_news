  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday, beginning at 07:11 GMT, disrupted over 113 of its services due to a technical error in a software update to DynamoDB’s API. The error triggered a DNS failure, preventing apps from connecting to server addresses, which caused widespread outages across banking, gaming, communication, media, e-commerce, and smart home services. The root cause was identified as human error, not a cyberattack. Despite full recovery by 10:11 GMT, AWS reported a backlog of messages to process. The incident underscored the critical dependence of modern digital infrastructure on a single cloud provider, with major companies like Snapchat, Roblox, WhatsApp, Delta, and The New York Times affected. Experts noted that while such outages are not rare, their scale reflects growing reliance on cloud systems, and AWS’s dominant market share means the ripple effect is both broad and significant.",
