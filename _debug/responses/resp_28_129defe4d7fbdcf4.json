  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's ambitious peace efforts in Ukraine and the Middle East are faltering due to persistent intransigence from key actors. In Ukraine, a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin was abandoned after failed talks, while Russia continued its drone attacks on Ukrainian power plants, reinforcing its demand for Ukrainian territorial concessions in Luhansk and Donetsk. In the Middle East, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, brokered under Trump’s initiative, is fragile due to Hamas-led violence and Israeli airstrikes, prompting Vice President JD Vance’s urgent visit to reassert U.S. commitment and pressure regional allies. Despite Trump’s claims of progress, the ceasefire remains at risk, and key structural elements—like a technocratic Palestinian administration and an international stabilization force—have not been implemented. The article underscores that both peace initiatives are undermined by mutual distrust, lack of structural solutions, and the difficulty of sustaining momentum without tangible political or military shifts.",
