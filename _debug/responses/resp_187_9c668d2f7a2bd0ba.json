  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Health Organization's Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the Gaza health crisis is a long-term catastrophe that will last for generations, resulting from famine, destroyed healthcare systems, and rampant mental health problems. Despite a ceasefire brokered by the US on 10 October 2025, aid deliveries remain critically low—only 200–300 lorries per day instead of the required 600—with supplies often confiscated or restricted. Dr. Tedros emphasizes that aid must be neutral and unrestricted, especially after the release of Israeli hostages and the transfer of some remains. He calls on Israel to open all access routes and allow previously denied aid organizations to operate. The situation is further complicated by military actions, such as air strikes following an attack on Israeli troops, and the ongoing refusal to allow full access to medical evacuations. The UN estimates $70 billion is needed for reconstruction, with $7 billion for health. The crisis underscores the fragility of the ceasefire and the urgent need for sustained, equitable humanitarian action.",
