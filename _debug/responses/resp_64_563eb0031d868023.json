The move follows a previous diplomatic recall in July and comes amid escalating tensions between Colombian President Gustavo Petro and US President Donald Trump, who accused Petro of being a drug leader and threatened to cut financial subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian goods. Colombia claims that the US actions amount to murder and that the attacks are politically motivated, while the US maintains it is acting to combat drug trafficking. The situation underscores a deepening diplomatic rift between the two nations over drug policy, sovereignty, and national security.",
