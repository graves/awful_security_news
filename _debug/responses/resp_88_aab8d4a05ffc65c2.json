  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the widespread resurgence of cowboy imagery in American culture, from fashion and advertising to politics and television. It traces the roots of this trend to early 19th-century performances like the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and later Western films that romanticized cowboys as symbols of patriotism and rugged individualism. The current surge — seen in Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' tour, TV shows like 'Yellowstone,' and political rhetoric from figures like Donald Trump — reflects broader cultural conservatism and a national yearning for traditional, rural values. However, the article critiques the mythologization of the cowboy, noting that real cowboys were historically Mexican, Native American, or Black, and that mainstream depictions ignore this diversity. The article highlights the efforts of Black cowboys and photographers like Gabriela Hasbun to bring visibility to marginalized communities in rodeo culture. Despite growing recognition, the popular cowboy narrative continues to be 'whitewashed,' emphasizing only the idealized, heroic version of the past while erasing its complex, often painful history.",
