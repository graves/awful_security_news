  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, which killed at least 16 people and injured several others, was linked to a steel cable that failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator CARRIS. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) indicate serious flaws in the cable, maintenance records, and brake systems. Maintenance tasks were falsely marked as completed, and the maintenance plan was recorded as compliant despite non-compliance. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the crash as sudden and chaotic. The interim report is not final, and a full final report is expected to be released next year.",
