  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally relinquished his royal titles, including Duke of York, following sustained public and legal scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and ties to an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo. The decision, made after discussions with King Charles and Prince William, reflects a significant shift in the royal family’s approach to accountability and public perception. The controversy began with Virginia Giuffre’s 2015 lawsuit, which alleged that Andrew engaged in sexual activity with her while she was underage and that he was aware of her status. This led to the stripping of his military titles and charitable roles. Further, a 2024 tribunal revealed that Yang Tengbo was authorized to act on Andrew’s behalf in meetings with Chinese investors, raising national security concerns. Although Prince Andrew denies all allegations and retains his title as 'Prince' due to being the son of Queen Elizabeth II, he will no longer attend royal events and will only be known by his first name. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson will now be referred to as Sarah Ferguson only, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, retain their titles. The situation remains sensitive, with Giuffre’s posthumous memoir set to release, adding further context to the allegations.",
