  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed escalation of US-China trade tensions, with US President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals—critical to technologies like smartphones and electric vehicles. China justified its actions as a defense of national security and a response to US trade restrictions and targeting of Chinese industries. This escalation, occurring just before the planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi in South Korea, risks reigniting a full trade war after a previous truce. The conflict is rooted in a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls, with both nations weaponizing economic interdependence and national security claims. Experts note that while China has shown strategic preparation and broader national security framing, the US has exhibited less coherence, and both sides are likely to retain escalation tools to project strength. The outcome will depend less on diplomacy and more on market stability and economic resilience, with China facing export-related growth risks and the US facing inflation and market uncertainty.",
