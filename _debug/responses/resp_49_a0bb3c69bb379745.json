The ballroom, which will seat 650 people and feature ornate neoclassical design elements such as gold chandeliers and gilded columns, is intended to expand the White House’s entertaining capacity and align with Trump’s personal aesthetic, reminiscent of his private clubs. The project, described as fulfilling a 15-year ambition, has proceeded with no apparent zoning restrictions, according to Trump, who claims executive authority to act without approval.

The demolition has sparked public debate, with critics calling it a violation of historical integrity, while supporters view it as a necessary evolution of the White House as a national symbol and event venue.",
