  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that climate change will result in an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100, even under current emissions commitments. This represents a significant improvement from the pre-Paris Climate Agreement scenario, which would have added 114 such days. However, the study highlights a profound global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in dangerous heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days, while major emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days despite being responsible for 42% of global emissions. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequities and provoke geopolitical instability, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by extreme heat, and that the climate future remains dangerously precarious regardless of current efforts.",
