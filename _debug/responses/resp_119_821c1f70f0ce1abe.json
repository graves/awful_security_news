  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins is demanding that President Donald Trump remove his performance of the song 'Danger Zone' from a fake AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, where a crown-wearing Trump is shown in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protesters in Times Square. The video, posted in response to the No Kings protests, features music from the 1986 movie *Top Gun*, and Loggins claims the use of his performance is unauthorized and politically divisive. Although the use of music in political content is generally legal with proper compensation, artists often object publicly to prevent the erosion of cultural unity. Previous legal actions, including lawsuits from The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate, reflect a broader trend of musicians resisting political appropriation of their work. The White House has not directly addressed Loggins’ request, instead sharing a *Top Gun* promotional image, underscoring the tension between political messaging and artistic rights.",
