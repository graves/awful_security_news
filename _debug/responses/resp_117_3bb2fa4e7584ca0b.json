  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the final weeks of 2025, New Jersey is experiencing a closely contested gubernatorial race between Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Despite New Jersey’s typically blue political leanings in presidential and Senate races, the gubernatorial election has historically been purple, with voters often electing candidates from both parties. The race is intensifying with personal attacks: Sherrill has criticized Ciattarelli for allegedly downplaying opioid risks and for blocking her from walking at her naval academy graduation, while Ciattarelli has accused Sherrill of falsely claiming he caused mass deaths from opioid overuse. Sherrill has received endorsements from former President Barack Obama and is criticizing the Trump administration for releasing her military records, while Ciattarelli has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, who plans to host tele-rallies. National politics is deeply influencing the campaign, and personal disputes have escalated to the point of a defamation threat from Ciattarelli’s campaign. However, voter concerns remain focused on affordability—specifically rising energy and property costs—with both candidates addressing these issues. Polls show a narrow or tied margin, and if Sherrill wins, it would mark the first time since the 1960s that a governor from the same party has served three consecutive terms in New Jersey.",
