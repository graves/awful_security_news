  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans receiving mental health care through the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) system are reporting that their one-on-one therapy sessions are being abruptly ended or limited, despite clinical need. This policy shift, intensified since 2021 under VA Secretary Doug Collins, restricts therapy to a set number of sessions (4–24), often without patient or provider input. Providers face disciplinary action if they extend care, and some have resigned due to frustration. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell express deep concern, citing trauma, abandonment, and re-traumatization. While some private sector practices limit sessions, experts including the American Psychological Association argue that long-term, individualized care is essential for chronic conditions like PTSD. The VA denies any systemic limits on care, but providers and patients report a significant decline in trust and continuity of care, raising serious questions about access, equity, and patient-centered treatment in VA mental health services.",
