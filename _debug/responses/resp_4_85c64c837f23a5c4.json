  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, with over 50 drones targeting critical facilities in a single night. These attacks have led to widespread blackouts, including in Kyiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi, and are being used as a tactic to terrorize civilians and prolong suffering. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded by calling on European allies for urgent military and financial support, including air defense systems and long-range missiles. He has also proposed using frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—to fund the acquisition of Patriot air defense systems. The European Union is exploring such assets as a loan, though the Kremlin calls it illegal. Analysts note a pattern where Russian aggression increases when U.S. pressure on Russia diminishes, such as after Trump’s statements suggesting Ukraine would have to give up territory. Zelensky remains cautious about a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, warning that such a venue could favor Russian interests. The article underscores Ukraine’s growing reliance on European allies amid continued Russian military pressure and diplomatic uncertainty.",
