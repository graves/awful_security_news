  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated the construction of a $250 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency responsible for such projects. The demolition of part of the East Wing—historically the base of operations for the first lady—has drawn public and legal scrutiny, with concerns over historical preservation, procedural compliance, and transparency. Trump claims the project is privately funded and will accommodate up to 999 people, with Carrier Global Corp. donating HVAC systems, but no public disclosure of donors or full cost breakdowns has been made. The project, scheduled for completion before the end of Trump’s term in January 2029, represents the largest structural change to the White House since the Truman Balcony in 1948, and its execution without formal oversight raises significant questions about federal regulations, accountability, and the integrity of a national symbol.",
