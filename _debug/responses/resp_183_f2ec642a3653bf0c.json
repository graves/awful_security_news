  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new species during a deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia. These include the West Australian Lantern Shark, a glowing shark found over 600 meters below sea level with large eyes and bioluminescent features, and a new type of porcelain crab, about 1.5cm long, which feeds on plankton using long hairs instead of claws. The research highlights Australia’s vast biodiversity and the continued discovery of unknown marine life in unexplored deep-sea zones. While 20 species have been identified so far, scientists estimate around 600 more remain to be described and validated due to the time required for scientific analysis.",
