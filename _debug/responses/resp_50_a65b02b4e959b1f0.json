The protests, led by the Indivisible Project and other decentralized groups, emphasized nonviolent resistance and the defense of democracy, free speech, and civil rights. Protesters from across the U.S., including cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Portland, gathered to oppose federal immigration raids, the deployment of the National Guard, cuts to public services like Medicaid, and the erosion of democratic institutions. Many attendees expressed fear about the future of democracy, citing concerns over executive overreach, government suppression of dissent, and the impact of billionaire influence. While the majority of events remained peaceful and resulted in no arrests, some incidents of aggression were reported. The protests reflect a broad national sentiment that democracy is under threat and that citizens must actively defend it through peaceful, unified action.",
