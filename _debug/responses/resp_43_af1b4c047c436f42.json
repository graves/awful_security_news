  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration’s imposition of steep tariffs on coffee imports — including a 50% duty on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia — has led to significant cost increases for U.S. coffee roasters. As the U.S. imports over 99% of its coffee, these tariffs are directly impacting retail prices, with average coffee prices at restaurants and shops rising by nearly 21% in August 2025. Businesses like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting report higher bean costs and operational strain, prompting some to diversify suppliers. While consumers may shift brands or seek deals, coffee remains perceived as an affordable luxury, so consumption habits are not expected to change drastically. In response, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' in September 2025 to exempt coffee products from tariffs, offering a potential policy solution to this growing issue.",
