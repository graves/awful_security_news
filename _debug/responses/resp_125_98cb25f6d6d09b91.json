  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once on the brink of extinction, has shown a slow but encouraging recovery, rising to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025—up from 376 in 2024. This growth follows a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020, and marks a positive shift after years of threats such as ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. Scientists at the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center, in collaboration with NOAA, report that improvements in reproductive health—such as increased calf births and shorter intervals between calvings—are key signs of recovery. Conservation efforts, especially new management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, are credited with helping the population rebound. However, experts remain cautious, noting that the species is still vulnerable and that stronger legal protections, such as those under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, are essential to ensure long-term survival.",
