He later retracted the comment, apologizing for causing concern and stating that the National Guard was not needed. The controversy was compounded by revelations that Salesforce had previously proposed AI tools to assist ICE in deportation efforts, raising ethical and political questions about corporate involvement in immigration enforcement. The backlash was significant enough to prompt venture capitalist Ron Conway to resign from the Salesforce Foundation board. This incident reflects a broader shift in some Bay Area tech leaders toward supporting Trump’s policies, sparking debate about political neutrality and corporate responsibility.",
