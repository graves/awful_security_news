    "China has tightened export controls on 12 out of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new ones: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, in addition to seven previously restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used to refine these metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals and justify the intended use of products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China justifies the controls under national security concerns, citing dual-use applications and instances of sensitive transfers of rare-earth materials for military purposes.",
    "The United States is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth of such products in 2023, and sourcing 70% of its rare-earth imports from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for critical technologies, including electric vehicles, AI semiconductors, F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and medical imaging equipment.",
    "China is the world's largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "The move is seen as a strategic signaling tactic before the Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, intended to strengthen China’s leverage in trade negotiations and underscore its ability to disrupt US supply chains.",
    "The restrictions are not absolute—exports for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief will remain exempt."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced stricter export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions, and on specialized refining equipment, effective from December 1, 2025. The controls are justified on national security grounds, citing dual-use applications and sensitive transfers to military entities. The move comes just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. With the US being the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and critical for defence technologies such as fighter jets, submarines, and AI semiconductors, these restrictions are seen as a strategic leverage tool. Analysts interpret the action as a pre-meeting signal to strengthen China’s position in trade negotiations, highlighting the deep interdependence and vulnerability of global supply chains. Exemptions exist for emergency medical and disaster relief exports, signaling a balance between security and humanitarian needs.",
