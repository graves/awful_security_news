    "Israel has implemented new registration rules for international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, requiring approval from a committee that includes Israeli representatives from the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.",
    "The new criteria for re-registration include accusations of supporting 'terrorist groups and activities' or 'inciting racism', with organizations citing these rules as being applied broadly to statements classified as antisemitic.",
    "Multiple major aid organizations, including the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Mercy Corps, have been denied re-registration, placing them in a state of limbo and effectively shutting them out of Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
    "At least one U.S.-based NGO has been de-registered and is now in an appeal process, while others are blocked from sending in supplies or staff despite having submitted requests.",
    "Israel continues to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from sending aid or staff into Gaza, citing unsubstantiated claims that it employs Hamas members, including those involved in the October 7, 2023 attack.",
    "UNRWA, which previously provided critical humanitarian services — including shelters, medical care, and schools — now faces severe operational restrictions, with food and supplies stored in Egypt and Jordan unable to enter Gaza due to Israeli restrictions.",
    "Of the seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza, only two are currently open, and many aid requests are rejected without explanation, despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid delivery.",
    "Humanitarian officials report that hundreds of aid trucks have been waiting for months in Egypt and Jordan, with Israel allowing only about 10% of them as genuine international aid, the rest being commercial imports from Israel.",
    "Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that are ideologically driven or lack experience in humanitarian aid, including one that partners with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a militarized aid model rejected by most other aid groups.",
    "The U.S. stopped funding UNRWA in 2024, leading to a 25% loss in income; although Europe and others have increased contributions, the funding gap remains unresolved."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has enacted sweeping new regulations requiring international nongovernmental aid organizations (INGOs) to re-register under strict ideological criteria, including approval from a committee that includes Israeli representatives with power to deem groups as delegitimizing Israel due to statements deemed antisemitic or linked to terrorism. This process has effectively shut down or placed major aid organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps in limbo. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and most aid requests are denied without explanation. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the largest humanitarian provider in Gaza, is banned from operating there due to unsubstantiated accusations of employing Hamas members, despite having provided critical services for decades. The U.S. funding cut to UNRWA in 2024 has further weakened its capacity, and humanitarian officials report that supplies stored in Egypt and Jordan — enough to feed Gaza for three months — remain inaccessible. These developments represent a significant escalation in the politicization of humanitarian aid, threatening the delivery of basic necessities to a population facing famine-level conditions after extensive Israeli airstrikes have destroyed over 90% of homes and infrastructure in Gaza.",
