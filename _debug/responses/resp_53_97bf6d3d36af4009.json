  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The widespread resurgence of cowboy imagery in media, fashion, and politics in 2025 reflects a deeper cultural trend rooted in political conservatism and nostalgia for traditional American values. While cowboys in popular media and advertising are portrayed as rugged, patriotic, and hardworking, this image is largely a myth constructed through Western films, Buffalo Bill shows, and political rhetoric, and ignores the historical contributions of Mexican, Native, and enslaved Black Americans. The current trend is amplified by figures like Beyoncé, whose 'Cowboy Carter' tour and album spotlight Black cowboy culture, and by conservative politicians such as Donald Trump, whose policies and rhetoric echo cowboy ideals of individualism and frontier strength. Despite growing visibility of diverse cowboy communities — especially in rodeos like the Bill Pickett Rodeo — mainstream narratives continue to whitewash this history, emphasizing only the romanticized, sunny aspects of Western life while omitting poverty, labor struggles, and systemic exclusion. This cyclical revival of cowboy culture illustrates how cultural myths are perpetuated and rebranded, serving as both a symbol of resistance to urban modernity and a tool of political messaging.",
