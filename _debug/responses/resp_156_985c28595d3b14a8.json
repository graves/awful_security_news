  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual weather patterns, animal behavior, or using traditional signals like gunfire—is proving essential in saving lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially when official early warning systems fail due to technical issues, lack of maintenance, and community distrust. Despite a $37 million government initiative (GLOF-II) and support from institutions like the NDMA and World Bank, residents like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on personal and intergenerational wisdom to detect and warn of disasters. These community-based systems have prevented fatalities during multiple events, demonstrating their effectiveness where technological systems fall short. The article highlights a critical gap in climate resilience: while governments invest in technology, they often neglect local knowledge and trust-building, leading to real-world outcomes where human intuition and tradition save lives instead of machines.",
