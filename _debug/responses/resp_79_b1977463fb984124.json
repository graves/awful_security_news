  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, the Big Cities Health Coalition — a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities — issued a public statement urging vaccination amid growing concerns that federal government messaging, including false claims from President Donald Trump and recent changes to childhood immunization schedules, is undermining public trust and leading to rising disease outbreaks. The coalition highlights the risks of measles and respiratory viruses, especially in cross-jurisdictional settings like between South Carolina and Mecklenburg County, where over 100 unvaccinated students are quarantined due to exposure. They argue that local public health systems must act independently and with scientific integrity, as federal agencies such as the CDC and HHS face declining public trust and political interference. The article underscores the critical role of vaccination in protecting school communities, maintaining public safety, and ensuring that public health decisions are based on data, not ideology.",
