  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly targeting power stations and gas delivery facilities, using hundreds of advanced drones and software-modified missiles that evade Western defenses. The October 10, 2025 strike on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 devastated a key power source, leaving the capital without electricity and water for much of the day, and marking a shift from earlier attacks to a focused strategy designed to leave civilians defenseless during the harsh winter. Corruption and poor infrastructure planning have further weakened Ukraine’s ability to defend critical systems, while civilians are responding with personal preparations like gas canisters, power banks, and wood stoves. Analysts warn that the combination of increased attack sophistication, repeated strikes, and systemic vulnerabilities could lead to a severe winter crisis with widespread blackouts and humanitarian risks.",
