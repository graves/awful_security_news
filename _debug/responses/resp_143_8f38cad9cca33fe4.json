  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—passed down through generations—is proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems in predicting and responding to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite significant investments in EWS technology like the $37 million GLOF-II project, communities lack trust due to repeated system failures, poor communication, and lack of community involvement. Shepherds such as Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on traditional methods—such as gunfire signals, animal behavior, and natural signs—to alert villagers and prevent loss of life. The World Bank and UNDP highlight Pakistan’s rapid warming and climate vulnerability, reinforcing the need for culturally relevant, community-driven adaptation strategies. As climate change accelerates, the article underscores a critical global lesson: integrating local knowledge with technology is essential for effective climate resilience.",
