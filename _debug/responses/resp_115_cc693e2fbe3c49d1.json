  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to the lethal fungus Metarhizium brunneum by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected workers self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase their distance from foragers, forming a form of proactive social distancing. When exposed to the fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with wider entrances and longer travel routes, reducing disease transmission. These structural changes work in tandem with social behaviors to protect the colony. This discovery demonstrates the first known case of a non-human social species actively modifying its physical environment in response to disease threats. Experts suggest that these natural strategies could inspire future human designs for public spaces that reduce the spread of infectious diseases through principles like spatial isolation and compartmentalization—referred to as 'architectural immunity.'",
