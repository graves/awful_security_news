  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has withdrawn from plans for a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest after it became evident that Moscow refuses to accept a ceasefire at the current front line. The U.S. and Ukraine have proposed freezing the conflict along existing battle lines, but Russia insists on full troop withdrawal and recognition of Russian sovereignty over the Donbas region. A key diplomatic shift occurred when a preparatory meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was canceled, suggesting a lack of progress. European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argue that the current front line freeze is a necessary first step in diplomacy, while Russia sees it as temporary. The potential U.S. supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine is highlighted as a factor that prompted Russia’s diplomatic engagement. Trump reportedly had a tense exchange with Putin, with speculation that he pushed Zelensky to yield territory in Donbas—though Zelensky maintains Ukraine cannot surrender this area. The situation underscores a deepening diplomatic impasse, with both sides prioritizing opposing visions of a long-term peace.",
