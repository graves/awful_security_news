  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. has officially ended its 50+ year giant panda program, marking the departure of Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji to China. This end follows a long history of 'panda diplomacy' beginning in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China. China has used pandas as a diplomatic tool, especially to build relationships in regions of strategic interest, while also emphasizing conservation efforts. However, the program has declined in recent years due to deteriorating U.S.-China relations, including viral claims of panda abuse and shifting diplomatic priorities. Other U.S. zoos, including Zoo Atlanta, will also lose their pandas soon, leaving only Xin Xin in Mexico City as the remaining panda in the Americas. While China maintains that the program supports biodiversity and species conservation, environmental challenges in China threaten long-term panda viability. The National Zoo is hopeful for future returns, with plans for exhibit renovation and public appeal, including a call for First Lady Jill Biden to resume the tradition.",
