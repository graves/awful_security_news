  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing — traditionally a base for the first lady — to construct a $250 million ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal body responsible for overseeing such projects. President Donald Trump announced the project, claiming it would accommodate up to 999 people and be privately funded by businesses and individuals, with Carrier Global Corp. donating an HVAC system. However, the project raises major concerns about federal regulations, transparency, and the impact on historic building elements. The demolition is set to begin in September 2025, with completion expected before Trump's term ends in January 2029, and no full list of donors has been released.",
