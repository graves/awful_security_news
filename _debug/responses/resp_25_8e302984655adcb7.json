  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This follows a previous 35-day shutdown in 2018, which was the longest in nearly 50 years and cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. During the 2018 event, about 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted. The current shutdown is more severe because it affects all federal agencies, unlike the 2018 partial shutdown. Political gridlock, including a narrow Republican majority and a lack of votes to end Senate filibusters, has made bipartisan agreement difficult. CNN reports on the ongoing situation and details which services are affected or continuing.",
