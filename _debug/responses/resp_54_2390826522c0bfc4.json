    "The GOP, including President Donald Trump and key figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has amplified claims that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent criminals.",
    "These claims are baseless and contradicted by data showing that left-wing violence is not significantly higher than decades of right-wing violence, and that past June rallies were largely peaceful with only a few minor incidents.",
    "The rhetoric mirrors past Republican attacks on Trump supporters, such as calling them 'basket of deplorables' or 'garbage', indicating a strategic and self-contradictory shift in political messaging.",
    "Democratic leaders like Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Ruben Gallego have challenged the GOP narrative, warning that such rhetoric could justify militarization and create a pretext for increased political repression.",
    "Public opinion polls (Marquette University Law School and CBS News-YouGov) show Americans are split on whether left- or right-wing violence is worse, and a majority view the Republican Party as 'extreme'."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Republican Party, led by President Donald Trump and key figures such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has launched a highly exaggerated and baseless campaign claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies—held across the U.S.—are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists. Despite evidence showing that past rallies were largely peaceful, with only minor and contextually ambiguous incidents of violence, the GOP has escalated rhetoric to frame the protests as inherently dangerous. This rhetoric echoes past attacks on Trump supporters, such as the 'basket of deplorables' claims, revealing a strategic inconsistency. Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Ruben Gallego, have challenged the narrative, warning that such claims could justify militarization and political repression. Public opinion polls suggest a divided view on violent extremism, with Americans evenly split between left- and right-wing violence, and a majority perceiving the Republican Party as more extreme. This rhetoric is seen as politically strategic, potentially opening the door to increased government control over political expression.",
