  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge systems — such as observing animal behavior, unusual weather patterns, and using traditional signals like gunfire — are being used by local shepherds to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite a $37 million government project (GLOF-II) launched in 2017 to install early warning systems, these systems are largely non-functional and untrusted due to technical failures, lack of community engagement, and poor follow-up. Residents have consistently relied on traditional, human-based methods, with individuals like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain saving lives through timely alerts. Pakistan, ranking among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, faces increasing GLOF risks due to glacier melt and reduced snowfall. The article highlights a critical gap: while technology is being invested, local knowledge and trust are essential for effective disaster response. This reliance on Indigenous knowledge underscores a broader global challenge where technology alone cannot succeed without community integration, cultural understanding, and accountability.",
