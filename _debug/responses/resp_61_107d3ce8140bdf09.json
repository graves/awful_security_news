  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports that U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signaled a shift in diplomatic tone, with Trump advocating for a ceasefire along current battle lines and expressing cautious support for Ukrainian defense. While Trump raised concerns about supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine—potentially escalating the war—he quickly downplayed the threat, indicating a preference for peace. Despite this, the real prize for Ukraine—lasting peace or a decisive military victory—remains out of reach. Meanwhile, Ukraine has held key positions in the war, thanks in part to effective drone warfare and strong resilience. Russia faces mounting economic and military pressure, including failure to achieve breakthroughs and internal strain, while global allies such as India are being affected by U.S. sanctions, reducing Russia’s diplomatic leverage. The article suggests that Putin’s strategic position is increasingly precarious, and the future of the war hinges on battlefield developments, winter conditions, and the possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough at the Budapest summit.",
