  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "AI voice cloning has advanced to the point where synthetic voices are indistinguishable from real human ones, as demonstrated by a recent scam in Italy where fraudsters used deepfake voices to mimic Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, requesting millions in money from wealthy businessmen. The scam, which targeted prominent figures like Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, resulted in only one transfer—by Massimo Moratti—being traced and frozen. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that 58% of AI-generated voice clones are mistaken for real human voices, and participants often rate AI voices as more trustworthy. Global deepfake fraud has surged, with over $547 million lost globally from January to June 2025. The technology is also being used to create harmful content, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material, prompting legal actions in the U.S. and Australia to ban such uses. While AI voice technology has beneficial applications such as restoring voices for those who can't speak, its misuse poses serious risks to personal security, financial stability, and public trust.",
