  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank, banning the UNRWA agency from operating and de-registering major international aid organizations (INGOs) under new ideological criteria. The process, overseen by COGAT, includes rejecting applications based on vague grounds such as 'inciting racism' or supporting 'terrorist activities,' effectively targeting groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, Israel continues to limit crossings, allowing only two of seven border crossings to remain open. Humanitarian organizations report that hundreds of aid trucks have been stranded in Egypt and Jordan, with critical supplies like food, medicine, and shelter remaining inaccessible. Israel's claims of security concerns lack evidence, and the de-registration process has been widely criticized as politically motivated. Meanwhile, UNRWA, which previously provided essential services like shelter, healthcare, and education in Gaza, remains banned from entering, with its emergency food stockpiles in Jordan and Egypt still inaccessible.",
