  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing to construct a new $250 million ballroom, claiming the project will respect the existing structure and be funded by private donors. Despite Trump's assertion that the new ballroom will be 'near' but not 'touching' the historic building, critics—including the National Park Service, Society of Architectural Historians, and American Institute of Architects—have raised concerns about the lack of a formal, rigorous review process for such a significant change. The East Wing, constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942, is undergoing one of the most substantial alterations in over 80 years. The project, managed by Clark Construction and designed by McCrery Architects, has drawn scrutiny for bypassing standard architectural and preservation protocols, with experts warning that it may reflect political style over historical integrity. The White House has not disclosed the identities of the private donors, adding to the debate about transparency. This project is seen as part of a broader pattern of recent changes by Trump, including re-decorating the Oval Office and paving over the Rose Garden.",
