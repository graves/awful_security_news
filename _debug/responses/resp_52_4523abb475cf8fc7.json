    "James Comey, former FBI Director, has launched legal motions to dismiss federal charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, claiming the prosecution is a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump.",
    "Comey's attorneys argue that the prosecution constitutes an abuse of power and retaliation for protected speech, citing numerous public statements from both Comey and Trump showing personal attacks on Comey.",
    "Comey's legal team claims that Trump’s appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim US attorney violated constitutional rules by circumventing the Senate confirmation process, as Halligan was appointed after the 120-day interim term had expired.",
    "The attorneys argue that Halligan’s appointment is unlawful and that Trump’s actions allow a pattern of avoiding Senate approval, thus undermining constitutional checks and balances.",
    "Comey’s team references the dismissal of Trump’s own indictment in Florida over a similar issue — the unlawful appointment of special counsel Jack Smith — as precedent to support their claim that Halligan’s appointment is unconstitutional.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is challenging federal criminal charges of lying and obstructing a congressional proceeding, claiming they are the result of a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the prosecution is constitutionally invalid due to an unlawful appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan. His legal team argues that Trump’s actions — including public attacks on Comey and bypassing Senate confirmation by appointing Halligan after her 120-day interim term ended — constitute retaliation for protected speech and a violation of constitutional checks and balances. The case is notable for drawing attention to the potential for political retaliation in federal prosecutions and the legal precedent set by the dismissal of Trump’s own Florida indictment over an unlawful appointment.",
