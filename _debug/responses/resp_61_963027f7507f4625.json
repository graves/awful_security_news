  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, who had been missing for about two weeks, were discovered behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia. Authorities say an anonymous tip led them back to the site, where they found her in a shallow grave. DNA testing confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and other offenses. Evidence, including cellphone location data and video showing a stolen black Hyundai Accent parked near where Scott was last seen, links King to the case. The vehicle was later found on fire and was destroyed before full inspection. King had a prior history of similar charges, which were dropped due to lack of court appearances. Prosecutors say more charges are in development, including homicide, and believe others may have been involved. Scott, who worked in an assisted living facility, was remembered by her parents as a source of kindness and light. The case underscores the importance of public tips and thorough investigations in missing persons cases.",
