    "Enshittification is a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the degradation of internet platforms over time, where platforms shift from user-friendly beginnings to prioritizing profits over user and business welfare.",
    "Doctorow outlines three stages of enshittification: Stage 1 (user-friendly growth), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at user and merchant expense).",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples where enshittification has occurred, particularly in ad targeting, search algorithms, and merchant fees.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, arguing that platforms exploit network effects and switching costs to maintain dominance.",
    "He proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing users to take data or content with them), greater interoperability between platforms, and a shift away from the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have responded to Doctorow’s claims with rebuttals, arguing their platforms have improved and that claims of 'cloning' products or 'junk fees' are misleading or false.",
    "A 2023 study cited by Doctorow shows that Amazon sellers lose 45–51 cents on every dollar earned due to fees, while top search results on Amazon are 29% more expensive than the best matches and the best result is often located 17 places down.",
    "Doctorow's theory has gained traction, especially in the anti-tech monopoly movement, which is growing both domestically and internationally."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces the concept of 'enshittification' — a term describing how internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber degrade from user-friendly beginnings into profit-driven, exploitative systems. He outlines three stages: Stage 1 (user-focused growth), Stage 2 (favoring businesses at user expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization through algorithmic manipulation, high fees, and reduced user value). Doctorow blames the lack of competition and weak consumer protections for this trend, arguing that platforms exploit network effects and switching costs. He proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations and greater interoperability between services. While Amazon and Facebook have denied his claims, data from a 2023 study supports his assertions about Amazon's impact on seller margins and search quality. The article highlights a growing anti-tech monopoly movement and calls for stronger antitrust enforcement and regulatory reform to reverse the decline of internet platforms.",
