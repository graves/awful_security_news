  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, targeting essential utilities and civilian life. These attacks, including over 50 strikes in one night, have caused widespread blackouts, water shortages, and civilian casualties. Ukraine responds with improved air defenses and retaliatory strikes, such as long-range Storm Shadow missile attacks on Russian facilities. Amid growing shortages of air defense systems, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European allies to provide immediate assistance, including financial support through the use of frozen Russian assets—amounting to $200 billion. The European Union, including Germany, is considering loans and strategic asset utilization, though Russia denies the legality of such actions. Analysts note a pattern of Russian escalation when U.S. pressure on Russia increases, especially as seen in the shifting tone of U.S. President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Ukraine remains cautious about a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, viewing it as a diplomatic risk. Zelensky stresses Ukraine’s resilience and commitment to peace, even in difficult circumstances.",
