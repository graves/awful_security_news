  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver is appearing in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 2025 congressional oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. The incident involved McIver attempting to intervene in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was removed from the site and later arrested for trespassing (a charge later dropped). Prosecutors claim McIver physically resisted officers, including slamming her forearm into one and using force to restrain him. Her defense argues the actions were part of official legislative duties and protected under the Speech or Debate Clause, and that the prosecution is politically motivated, especially given President Donald Trump’s public criticism and the contrast with Trump’s pardons of Capitol rioters. Judge Jamel Semper has ordered the removal of DHS social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa activity was involved, citing potential jury prejudice. The case has drawn bipartisan support from other Democratic lawmakers and highlights tensions between legislative oversight and federal enforcement, as well as broader political divisions over immigration and accountability.",
