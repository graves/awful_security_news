  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from the Christian Democratic Party, has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga with 54.5% of the vote. This victory marks the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS), which governed Bolivia since 2006. The election response to a deepening economic crisis—characterized by high inflation, declining natural gas exports, and fuel shortages—has led to a significant decline in MAS support. Paz’s moderate platform, emphasizing private sector-led growth and gradual reform, resonated with left-leaning voters who were disillusioned with MAS but wary of austerity. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal through populist social media outreach. Despite winning, Paz’s party lacks a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building. The new administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies, phasing out subsidies, and managing labor opposition. Both candidates have pledged to strengthen U.S. diplomatic ties and seek U.S. financial support, signaling a shift from Bolivia’s past anti-American stance. The election represents a transformative political turning point in Bolivia’s democratic trajectory.",
