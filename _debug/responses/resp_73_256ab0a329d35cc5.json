  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major outage on October 20, 2025, lasting several hours, which disrupted access to critical online services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking platforms. The root cause was a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing data stored in DynamoDB and other services hosted on AWS. Despite AWS being a dominant cloud provider, the incident illustrates the fragility of the modern internet, where a failure in one key component can cascade across millions of services. Experts attribute the vulnerability to a lack of redundancy and over-reliance on a few major cloud providers, undermining the original decentralized design of the internet. The event underscores the urgent need for diversification, improved system resilience, and better fallback mechanisms in digital infrastructure.",
