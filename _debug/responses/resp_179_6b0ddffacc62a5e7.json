Despite renewed violence, including a Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and prompted Israeli air strikes, both sides remain committed to the truce. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 deceased Israeli hostages, though full compliance remains a condition for Israeli participation in peace talks. The U.S. is pushing for negotiations on long-term solutions, including an interim Palestinian government, a UN-led stabilisation force, and Hamas disarmament. Meanwhile, humanitarian access remains limited—only two crossings are open, with severe shortages in northern Gaza—raising concerns about the sustainability of the ceasefire and the dire food situation. The article underscores the fragile balance between military action, diplomatic pressure, and humanitarian delivery in the current phase of the conflict.",
