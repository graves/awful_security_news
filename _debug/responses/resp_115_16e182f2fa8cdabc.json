  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations under Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago’s suburbs — particularly in Hanover Park — grassroots volunteer groups like Patrulla Popular have intensified their efforts to protect undocumented residents. Volunteers such as Ruby and Cristóbal Cavazos, and youth like Ivan, patrol neighborhoods, use whistles and loud noises to alert others of ICE presence, and remind migrants of their rights. Residents report increasing fear, with many avoiding work or school. ICE agents have responded with force, including tear gas during protests, while federal authorities accuse activists of endangering officers and interfering with duties. Activists argue their actions are essential for community safety, free speech, and the right to protest — values under threat from the Trump administration, which has publicly denounced such efforts.",
