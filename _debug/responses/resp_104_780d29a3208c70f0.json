    "The internet is undergoing a process known as 'enshittification,' where platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade in quality over time, shifting from user-focused models to profit-driven ones.",
    "This degradation occurs in three stages: (1) early growth with user-friendly incentives, (2) prioritization of business customers at user expense, and (3) exploitative pricing and algorithmic manipulation that harms both users and small businesses.",
    "Key factors driving enshittification include a lack of competition, weak consumer protection regulations, and the use of network effects and high switching costs to lock in users.",
    "Doctorow argues that platforms exploit their market power through predatory pricing, data misuse, algorithmic manipulation, and junk fees, particularly on Amazon, where sellers lose up to 51 cents per dollar earned.",
    "Consumers face worse search results and content feeds that prioritize paid ads over user preferences, with Amazon's top results often being 29% more expensive than the best matches and located far below the top of the search page.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have publicly disputed Doctorow’s claims, but he supports them with studies from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and independent research, citing evidence of platform degradation over time.",
    "Solutions proposed include stronger antitrust enforcement, abandoning the consumer welfare standard, enforcing 'right-to-exit' policies (e.g., transferring e-books from Kindle), and promoting interoperability (e.g., allowing third-party apps and ink cartridges to work across devices).",
    "The anti-tech monopoly movement has gained momentum globally, including among conservative voices, suggesting potential policy shifts to reverse enshittification."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article presents a theory by internet activist and author Cory Doctorow, known as 'enshittification,' describing how major internet platforms—such as Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and Google—have degraded from user-friendly, innovative environments into exploitative, profit-driven systems. Doctorow outlines three stages of this process: initial user-focused growth, business-centric expansion at user expense, and final exploitation involving predatory pricing, algorithmic manipulation, and hidden fees. He cites data from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance to support claims that Amazon charges sellers up to 51 cents per dollar earned and distorts search results, making top results significantly more expensive. While Amazon and Facebook refute these claims, the article emphasizes that the root causes—lack of competition and weak regulation—are systemic. Doctorow proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, abandoning the consumer welfare standard, enforcing a 'right-to-exit' policy, and promoting interoperability to reverse the trend of enshittification and restore user trust in digital platforms.",
