  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses how some employers require employees to repay benefits such as training or bonuses if they leave a job before a specified period — known as stay-or-pay agreements. These agreements, especially training repayment agreements (TRAPs), are criticized as abusive and limiting worker mobility, particularly for lower-income workers in industries like healthcare, transportation, and retail. Research estimates that up to 8.7% of workers are affected. In response, California passed a first-in-the-nation law banning repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprentice programs) and for benefits when employees are laid off without cause, with the law taking effect on January 1, 2026. The law still allows certain retention bonuses and tuition reimbursement for transferable credentials, but with prorated repayment and a two-year stay limit. The move is seen as a step toward protecting employee autonomy and financial freedom, and it may inspire similar legislation in other states like New York.",
