  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House, under President Donald Trump, has announced a major initiative to lower the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs through a new platform, TrumpRx, set to launch in January 2026. The plan includes a more than 70% price reduction on three key fertility drugs—Gonal-F, Ovidrel, and Cetrotide—manufactured by EMD Serono (a subsidiary of Merck KGaA), bringing prices from $5,000 to under $1,000 per cycle. The agreement includes a tariff reprieve in exchange for increased U.S. manufacturing and R&D investment. Pfizer and AstraZeneca have also signed similar deals. The administration encourages employers to offer IVF coverage through elective add-on plans, though no mandates exist. Critics, including reproductive medicine experts, express concern that only one of three major fertility drug manufacturers is included, and that broader coverage and clinical infrastructure (such as CDC oversight) may be lacking. The policy represents a significant, albeit limited, expansion of access to IVF, falling short of Trump’s earlier promise of universal government-paid IVF coverage.",
