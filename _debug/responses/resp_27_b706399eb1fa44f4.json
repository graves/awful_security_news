  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, has formally challenged proposed FDA label changes that would link acetaminophen use during pregnancy to increased risks of autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such use poses a danger, medical experts and major studies—including one of over 2 million children—have found no causal or significant association between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA maintains no clear evidence of harm from appropriate use, and Kenvue argues that the proposed label revisions are arbitrary, unsupported by science, and contrary to established medical consensus. Regulatory agencies in the EU, UK, and Canada have affirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, reinforcing the scientific view that the product remains a safe and widely recommended option for managing pain and fever in pregnant individuals.",
