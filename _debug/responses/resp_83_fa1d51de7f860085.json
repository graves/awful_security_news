  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche 89 (2000 CE), was discovered in a drone used to attack Kherson, Ukraine, in September 2024. The submunition, originally designed for rocket artillery, was modified for use on a first-person-view drone using basic materials. This discovery, reported by Conflict Armament Research (CAR), confirms a direct material link between North Korea’s defense industry and Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine. The finding underscores North Korea’s growing role in supporting Russia’s drone warfare campaign, which has intensified since 2024, including the deployment of around 12,000 North Korean troops to Russia, with about 4,000 reported killed or wounded.",
