  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, with over 4,500 Marines and sailors, multiple naval vessels, and air assets deployed in Puerto Rico and near Venezuela’s coast. Key actions include reopening Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, deploying F-35s and MQ-9 drones, and conducting training missions, including live-fire drills and intelligence-gathering flights. The buildup, driven by the Trump administration, is widely interpreted as a strategic pressure campaign aimed at weakening Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, rather than a full-scale invasion. Although the U.S. has the capability to launch Tomahawk missile strikes into Venezuela, experts emphasize that the military posture is not sufficient for an invasion due to Venezuela’s terrain, weather, and robust air defense systems such as S-300s and F-16s. The presence is seen as a show of force, intended to intimidate, signal deterrence, and disrupt Maduro’s regime through sustained military activity.",
