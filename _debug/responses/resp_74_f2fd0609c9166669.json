    "The Trump administration released two survivors from a failed strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, contradicting its claim of engaging in a war against 'narco-terrorists'.",
    "This release undermines the administration's narrative of a legitimate, urgent military threat to U.S. citizens, especially given the lack of public evidence supporting the claims of fentanyl trafficking or imminent harm.",
    "Legal experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have criticized the administration for effectively claiming war-like powers without congressional approval or a declared war.",
    "The decision to release the survivors instead of detaining or prosecuting them appears to be a strategic avoidance of legal accountability and due process, raising concerns about the legality and transparency of the operations.",
    "Criticism has come from both Latin American leaders — including Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who disputes the link between the victims and drug trafficking — and U.S. lawmakers, including two Republican senators who previously voiced concerns about the legality of the strikes.",
    "The administration’s refusal to disclose evidence or legal justifications for the strikes has fueled skepticism, and the release of the survivors has intensified scrutiny over whether the actions constitute unlawful or extrajudicial warfare."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced growing legal and ethical criticism for releasing two survivors from a failed military strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, despite claims that the individuals were 'narco-terrorists' and posed an imminent threat to American lives. The decision to release them contradicts the administration's narrative of a war-like conflict and undermines its argument for extraordinary military powers. Experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have questioned the legality of the actions, citing a lack of evidence, congressional approval, or a declared war. Critics from both Colombia and the U.S. Congress — including President Gustavo Petro and Republican senators like Todd Young — have raised concerns over the transparency, due process, and potential illegality of the operation. The administration's refusal to disclose evidence or allow legal challenges has led to a broader debate about whether these strikes constitute a legitimate war or a violation of civil liberties and international legal norms.",
