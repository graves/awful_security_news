  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. has ended its 50+ year partnership with China by returning three giant pandas — Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — to China, marking the end of a long-standing 'panda diplomacy' initiative. This shift occurs amid worsening U.S.-China relations, including public controversies over panda treatment in the U.S. and a global decline in panda loans. China, which owns all pandas and requires zoos to pay for conservation, continues to prioritize breeding and conservation, with successful population growth in the wild. The only remaining panda in the Americas is Xin Xin in Mexico City. While the National Zoo and Zoo Atlanta have invested millions in panda programs, the future of panda diplomacy in the U.S. remains uncertain, with hopes expressed that future leaders, such as First Lady Jill Biden, might revive the program.",
