  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the hidden exploitation within Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, which supply major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite being crucial to Guatemala’s economy—contributing nearly 10% of GDP—the factories operate under severe labor violations: workers face long hours, low wages (less than $500/month), threats, sexual harassment, and unsafe conditions. Most are women, and union activity is met with intimidation, violence, and dismissal. Korean-owned companies dominate the industry, controlling over two-thirds of investments. US brands benefit from subcontracting without legal responsibility for worker welfare. Despite reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, government enforcement is weak, and workers—like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra—lose pensions and severance when factories close. The article underscores systemic injustice, power imbalance, and a culture of fear, with workers like Alexandra choosing to exit the industry to protect future generations from similar trauma.",
