The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit against the New York Giants, with second-year quarterback Bo Nix leading a fourth-quarter explosion to secure a 33-32 victory.

On the flip side, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets both suffered devastating losses, with Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields benched due to poor performances. The Jets' head coach Aaron Glenn made a mid-game decision to replace Fields with Tyrod Taylor, highlighting ongoing instability in the team’s quarterback situation. The article underscores the unpredictability of the NFL season, with 26 lead changes in the final two minutes of regulation — the most in NFL history — and highlights a broader trend of quarterback turnover, dramatic upsets, and evolving team dynamics.",
