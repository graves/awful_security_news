  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which some initially viewed as a major diplomatic victory for President Donald Trump, public enthusiasm in the United States has been minimal. Polls show Trump's approval ratings remain at or below their lowest points in his second term, especially on economic issues, where disapproval reaches new highs. Americans show little interest in foreign policy matters, with only 4% prioritizing international events. Instead, concerns about inflation, rising prices, job security, and economic decline dominate public sentiment. Even the temporary boost in approval on the Gaza deal appears fragile, as public trust remains deeply tied to domestic economic performance. The article concludes that Trump’s political standing is not bolstered by foreign policy achievements, but rather undermined by persistent economic failures.",
