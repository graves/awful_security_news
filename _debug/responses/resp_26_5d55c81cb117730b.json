  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In September 2025, a fatal crash occurred on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, when a steel cable snapped during operation, resulting in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries. A preliminary investigation by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) revealed that the cable failed to meet the safety specifications established by the operator, CARRIS, and that maintenance logs were falsified, with tasks marked as completed without actual execution. Eyewitnesses described the derailment as chaotic and terrifying, with one man named Bruno noting the car's uncontrolled descent and the appearance of smoke. The findings highlight systemic failures in maintenance and safety certification, and while the report is preliminary, it underscores urgent concerns about public transportation safety in historic urban infrastructure.",
