Hamas denied any involvement, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and fabricating justifications. The U.S. State Department reported credible intelligence that Hamas was planning attacks on Palestinian civilians, raising concerns about compliance with ceasefire terms. Israel's military claimed that two soldiers were killed in the clashes, and an Israeli attack on a bus in Gaza City killed a family of 11, sparking accusations of civilian harm. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S. and involving the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, remains fragile, with Gaza's media office accusing Israel of violating it 80 times. Humanitarian and diplomatic concerns are escalating as both parties continue to accuse each other of breaches, threatening the stability of the fragile peace.",
