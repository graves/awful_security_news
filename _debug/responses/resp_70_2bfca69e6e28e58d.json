  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, affecting services like banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing data stored in AWS databases such as DynamoDB and EC2. Despite the data being safe, the outage caused widespread inaccessibility for millions of people, especially in the US East Coast. Experts attribute the incident to a technical fault, not a cyberattack, and highlight a broader systemic issue: the internet’s dependence on a few major cloud providers, which reduces resilience. This event underscores the need for redundancy and diversification in cloud infrastructure to avoid cascading failures, similar to past outages like the 2024 CrowdStrike glitch and AT&T’s network failures.",
