  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist on Sunday, French police discovered that eight valuable jewels from the Louvre museum had been stolen by a highly professional group of thieves who broke in and out in just eight minutes. Experts believe the gems were dismantled into smaller pieces to be sold or melted down, with potential financial value reaching up to £10 million. The stolen items, including pieces from Empress Eugénie’s tiara, were likely broken up due to their high value and sensitivity. Authorities suspect an organised crime network was involved, possibly for money laundering or to benefit a sponsor. DNA evidence from a vest left at the scene may aid in identifying the perpetrators. While public sentiment in France is deeply shaken, with many viewing the theft as a national trauma akin to stealing the Mona Lisa, experts suggest it is now unlikely the items will be recovered intact. There is a precedent in history where stolen items later reappeared, but such cases are extremely rare.",
