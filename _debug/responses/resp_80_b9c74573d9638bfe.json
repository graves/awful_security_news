  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with threatening federal law enforcement officials, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, after posting a series of threatening TikTok videos from August to October 2025. In one video, he urged viewers to shoot ICE agents if they appeared in neighborhoods, and in another, he referenced the murder of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk by suggesting 'do a lot more Charlie Kirks.' Federal investigators became aware of Stanton’s online activity after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, which flagged his inquiry into Israeli military locations. Despite multiple attempts to speak with him, Stanton refused contact and responded with hostility, including an exchange with a US Customs and Border Patrol supervisor. He is currently detained pending trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for December 1, 2025, and a trial set for December 15, 2025. His legal team maintains that the criminal complaint contains only allegations and that he is presumed innocent.",
