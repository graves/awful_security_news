  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, is holding its fourth plenum to finalize a new five-year economic plan (2026–2030) aimed at promoting high-quality development, technological self-reliance, and economic security amid escalating tensions with the United States. The meeting occurs at a critical juncture, as China faces slowing growth—down to 4.8% in Q3 2025—due to external trade friction and internal issues like overcapacity and weak consumer demand. A major highlight is the continued anti-corruption purge within the military, including the removal of top-ranking general He Weidong and others, signaling Xi’s consolidation of power. The plenum may also involve key personnel changes, potentially reshaping the Central Committee and Central Military Commission. While the core economic strategy remains unchanged, officials expect targeted adjustments to boost domestic consumption and address cutthroat competition. The timing coincides with a potential U.S.-China summit, making the event a pivotal moment in global geopolitical and economic dynamics.",
