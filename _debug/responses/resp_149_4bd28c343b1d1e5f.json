  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions, centered on Donald Trump’s threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth metals. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security, accusing the U.S. of discriminatory trade curbs. The conflict builds on a history of tit-for-tat tariffs, including Trump’s 2018–2024 actions and Biden’s semiconductor export controls. Key strategic issues include rare earth minerals and advanced semiconductors, which are vital for defense and technology. Experts suggest both nations are using economic measures as weapons, with China appearing more strategic and prepared, while the U.S. has broader global influence. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is now under threat due to escalating tensions, with both sides signaling willingness to escalate further. The article concludes that neither side wants to back down, and the outcome may depend more on global market reactions than diplomatic negotiation.",
