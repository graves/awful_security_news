  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges alleging he lied during congressional testimony, claiming the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His attorneys argue that Trump personally targeted Comey due to public criticism, citing a pattern of attacks by the president. Additionally, they assert that the appointment of White House adviser Lindsey Halligan as interim US Attorney violated constitutional rules by bypassing the Senate confirmation process, which would normally require a 120-day interim term to expire before a new appointment. The defense also draws a parallel to the dismissed indictment of former President Trump in Florida, where similar constitutional violations were found. The case raises significant concerns about executive overreach, the politicization of justice, and the integrity of prosecutorial appointments under the U.S. Constitution.",
