  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50-year giant panda program, marking the final departure of Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji to China. This conclusion follows years of declining U.S.-China relations, public controversy over alleged panda abuse in Memphis, and a broader trend of shrinking panda loan programs in Western countries such as Scotland and Australia. The pandas were returned to China’s Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where conservation efforts have improved the species' status. While China maintains ownership of all pandas and uses them for diplomatic and conservation purposes, the U.S. now has only Zoo Atlanta as a remaining home, with its contract also set to expire. With the end of programs in the U.S. and other countries, Xin Xin in Mexico City becomes the only panda in the Americas. Despite this, zoo staff remain hopeful that future exchanges may resume, and the National Zoo has begun planning renovations for its vacant exhibit.",
