  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Madagascar, a youth-led movement called Gen Z Mada, which emerged from protests over water and power outages, is now opposing the appointment of businessman Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as prime minister by newly installed head of state Col Michael Randrianirina. The youth group criticizes the appointment as non-transparent and unconsulted, claiming it violates the movement's goal of structural political change and undermines their revolution. The movement asserts that Rajaonarivelo’s ties to the previous government, led by President Andry Rajoelina, represent a betrayal of reform. The political crisis followed Rajoelina’s failure to quell protests and his subsequent flight from the country, after which Col Randrianirina, leader of the elite CAPSAT unit, took power in a military-backed transition. The youth movement remains vigilant, threatening continued mobilization unless the appointment is explained or reversed, signaling an ongoing struggle between democratic reform and military intervention in Madagascar’s governance.",
