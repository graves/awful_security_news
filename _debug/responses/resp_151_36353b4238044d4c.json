  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Madagascar experienced a political upheaval when Colonel Michael Randrianirina, a military officer and long-time critic of former President Andry Rajoelina, led a coup following nationwide protests initiated by the Gen Z Madagascar youth movement over water and power shortages. The protests, which began in September, escalated into demands for systemic reform. After Rajoelina fled the country amid the unrest, Randrianirina was sworn in as president and appointed businessman Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as prime minister, citing his international experience. The coup has drawn strong condemnation from the United Nations and African Union, both of which suspended Madagascar’s membership. The High Constitutional Court ratified the takeover swiftly, signaling the legitimacy of the new government. Rajoelina denies stepping down, calling claims of resignation false and accusing authorities of spreading disinformation, highlighting ongoing political instability and democratic erosion.",
