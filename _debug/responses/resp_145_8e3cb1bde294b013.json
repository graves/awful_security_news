  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central estimates that even under current climate commitments, the planet will face 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerous heat — due to climate change. This represents a significant improvement from the worst-case scenario of 114 extra days under 4°C warming, but still poses severe risks. The report highlights a stark global inequity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa — which produce just 1% of global emissions — will face dramatic spikes in heat exposure, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only a small fraction of the added heat. Experts warn that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected, with thousands already dying in heatwaves each year. The findings underscore both the urgency of climate action and the deep injustice in how climate change impacts are distributed across nations.",
