  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man accused of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008, to a prison term ranging from five years to life in prison. Rossi, whose real name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was identified through a decade-old DNA match from a rape kit backlog. He attempted to evade justice by faking his death in 2020, with an obituary claiming he died of lymphoma, which was later disproven. Authorities tracked him to Scotland, where he was arrested while receiving treatment for COVID-19 due to distinctive tattoos linked to an Interpol notice. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after years of legal battles and used aliases such as Arthur Knight. Rossi maintained his innocence during the trial and failed to testify. The victim testified about financial manipulation, deception, and the traumatic rape that occurred during an engagement. The case underscores the dangers of flight risks, the importance of DNA backlog systems, and the role of international cooperation in solving crimes involving sexual violence.",
