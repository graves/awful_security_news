  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "VA therapists and veterans report that one-on-one mental health therapy sessions are being abruptly cut off or limited under new policies implemented since 2021, particularly under VA Secretary Doug Collins. Veterans with chronic conditions like PTSD, such as Michael and Jake Pannell, say they are being denied continued care, causing emotional trauma and a sense of abandonment. Providers including Stephen Long and Mark Jorges have resigned or faced disciplinary pressure for resisting these limits, which are not aligned with clinical needs. The VA denies such limits exist, but providers and patient advocates argue that standardized, time-bound therapy fails long-term mental health recovery. The American Psychological Association is investigating, and experts stress that chronic mental illness should be treated with open-ended, patient-centered care, not fixed session caps. This policy shift has raised concerns about access to care, staff retention, and ethical treatment standards for veterans.",
