  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rejected the idea and warned it would damage U.S.-Russia relations. While Trump is not expected to commit to the deployment during a scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, officials say the U.S. has prepared contingency plans. Zelensky sees the missiles as a critical tool to pressure Russia into negotiations, while Putin argues they would not change the battlefield but could destabilize diplomatic ties. The potential for escalation remains a concern, though some officials maintain that previous escalatory actions have not significantly worsened the conflict. A planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest may buy Moscow more time as Trump shifts toward diplomatic solutions, influenced by recent success in Middle East diplomacy.",
