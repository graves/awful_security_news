  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two top Chinese military officials, He Weidong and Miao Hua, have been expelled from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army on corruption charges, marking the most senior military officers to be purged in an anti-corruption campaign that began in 2023. He Weidong, a former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and close ally of President Xi Jinping, is the first sitting general to be expelled from the CMC since the Cultural Revolution. The purge is part of a broader effort by President Xi to restructure military leadership and eliminate corruption, with implications for China’s military strategy and regional security—particularly in cross-strait relations. The expulsions are expected to be formalized at the upcoming Central Committee Fourth Plenum, where new appointments may be made. He Weidong’s ties to Xi Jinping date back to their time in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, and he played a key role in planning military drills around Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi's visit in 2022. The actions underscore a shift in China’s internal power dynamics and reinforce President Xi’s central authority over military and political affairs.",
