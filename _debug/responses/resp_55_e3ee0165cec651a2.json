  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed Senate confirmation and relied on delegation authority under the Attorney General. The DOJ argues that such delegation is a recognized and lawful practice, citing precedent where officials serve after their term expires or through delegated authority. However, critics—including legal counsel Abbe Lowell—contend that delegating full powers of a US attorney is unprecedented and unlawful, violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges being pursued in Nevada and California. Habba, a former Trump attorney, has defended the appointment as a necessary response to congressional obstruction, and the legal dispute is part of a wider political and legal battle over executive authority, confirmation processes, and accountability in federal appointments.",
