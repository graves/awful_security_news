  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products, arguing that such changes would be unsupported by scientific evidence and would contradict long-standing FDA guidance. The push comes after President Donald Trump suggested that pregnant women avoid Tylenol due to a claimed link with autism, despite no causal evidence. Multiple studies, including one of over 2 million children, have found no significant associations between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD. In contrast, a review of 46 studies noted only an association—not causation—between use and autism. International health agencies, including the EU, UK, and Health Canada, affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a citizen petition to require stronger warnings, but Kenvue and medical experts argue that the claims are unsubstantiated and that the current label, which advises consulting a health professional, is appropriate.",
