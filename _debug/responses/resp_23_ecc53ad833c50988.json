  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, designated Flight 6469, departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. local time on October 20, 2025, bound for Los Angeles, but made an emergency landing just 18 minutes later after the pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard knocking on the cockpit door. The Federal Aviation Administration determined the cause was a malfunction in the inter-phone system, which prevented communication between the flight crew and attendants. No security threat was identified, and the incident was deemed a technical failure. The aircraft, an Embraer ERJ 175 regional jet, was parked away from the terminal with two firetrucks present, indicating an immediate safety response. The event underscores vulnerabilities in in-flight communication systems and the importance of emergency protocols in commercial aviation.",
