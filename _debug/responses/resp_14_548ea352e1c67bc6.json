  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former Special Counsel Jack Smith have directly refuted claims that investigators in the January 6 Capitol riot probe wiretapped Republican members of Congress, emphasizing that toll records—covering only call duration, timing, and numbers—were obtained through routine and legally justified investigative procedures. The records were collected between January 4 and 7, 2021, to investigate reports that President Trump and allies attempted to contact senators to delay election certification. Smith’s legal team argues the scope of the records is narrowly tailored and consistent with standard DOJ practices, pointing to similar data collection in unrelated cases involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez. Republican lawmakers have accused the FBI and Smith of political weaponization, prompting scrutiny during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, where Democrats also raised concerns about the political targeting of Trump’s political opponents.",
