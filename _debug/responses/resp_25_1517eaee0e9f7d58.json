  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by poisoning her protein shakes with a combination of arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. The poisoning began with symptoms of dizziness and gastrointestinal distress, which were initially misdiagnosed. Over several days, Craig conducted extensive online research, purchased poisons, and used his office computer to search for methods to mask the murder as a heart attack. He delivered a lethal dose of cyanide via a refilled medication capsule and used protein shakes to administer tetrahydrozoline, a common ingredient in eyedrops. Staff at his dental practice, including Caitlin Romero and Dr. Ryan Redfearn, raised red flags after discovering suspicious deliveries and purchases. The case underscores the dangers of unchecked access to lethal substances and the importance of vigilance in healthcare environments. Craig was arrested in March 2023, and the prosecution successfully linked his actions to Angela’s death through forensic evidence and digital records.",
