  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), which aims to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, due to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump accused the IMO of passing a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' on shipping and threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on supporting nations. As a result, 63 previously supportive members shifted, with countries like Argentina and Singapore joining the delay. The NZF would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon penalty on emissions, marking the first global carbon-pricing system for shipping. The decision has been widely criticized by the UN and the shipping industry as a missed opportunity for climate action, underscoring global tensions between fossil fuel interests and climate urgency.",
