  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has called for urgent global expansion of early-warning systems for extreme weather events, emphasizing that nearly half of all countries lack adequate systems, especially in developing nations. Over the past 50 years, more than 2 million people have died due to climate-related disasters, with 90% of fatalities occurring in developing countries. Despite progress in early-warning adoption—rising from 52 to 108 countries in a decade—the assessment of 62 countries shows that half have only basic capacity and 16% have less. The article highlights real-world examples such as the 2025 flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, as well as the successful evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten due to a predicted glacier collapse. The WMO stresses that early warnings lead to early action, and that climate change is making weather events more extreme, making early-warning systems vital for saving lives and protecting infrastructure globally.",
