  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain individuals, particularly habitual drug users, from possessing firearms. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen charged in 2023 with possession of a gun, marijuana, and cocaine, with the prosecution based on his history of marijuana use. The Trump administration defended the law, asserting that habitual drug users with firearms pose a significant danger to public safety and law enforcement, especially while impaired. However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a ban violates constitutional precedent, stating that historical support for gun bans only applies to those under immediate influence of drugs or alcohol. The case is highly significant because it directly challenges the scope of the Second Amendment and the balance between public safety and individual rights. It is further complicated by the fact that Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, raising political and moral questions about the law’s fairness and application. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025, following arguments in the coming year, and its ruling will have broad implications for gun policy and drug regulation across the United States.",
