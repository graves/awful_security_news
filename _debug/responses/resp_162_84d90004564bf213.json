  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. federal court has barred the Israeli spyware company NSO Group from targeting WhatsApp users, ruling that its Pegasus spyware causes irreparable harm by enabling unauthorized access to private communications. The court found that NSO reverse-engineered WhatsApp’s code and used stealthy tactics like zero-click attacks to evade detection, thereby undermining the platform’s core promise of user privacy. While Meta had initially sought a broader injunction across its platforms, the judge declined to extend it without more evidence. The damages award was significantly reduced from $168 million to $4 million, citing insufficient legal precedent to deem the conduct 'particularly egregious.' The decision marks a landmark moment in digital privacy law, holding a major tech surveillance firm accountable for targeting journalists, lawyers, and human rights activists, and establishing that unauthorized surveillance of encrypted services violates fundamental user trust and democratic values.",
