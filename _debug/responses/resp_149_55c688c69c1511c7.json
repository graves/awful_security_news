    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of the 17 known rare-earth elements.",
    "The new restrictions apply to five additional metals: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 restricted metals (7 previously announced in April 2025, plus 5 new ones).",
    "China also restricted the export of specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, effective December 1, 2025.",
    "Foreign companies must obtain special approvals from Beijing to export rare-earth magnets and semiconductor materials containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China justified the controls on national security grounds, citing dual-use applications of rare-earth metals in both civilian and military technologies.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports originating from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for advanced defence systems (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, radar) and civilian technologies (e.g., electric vehicles, smartphones, medical imaging).",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "This move is seen as a strategic signal of leverage ahead of the Trump–Xi meeting at APEC, indicating China's intent to use supply chain dominance as a diplomatic tool.",
    "Analysts suggest the restrictions deepen the US defence and industrial vulnerability, widening capability gaps and undermining US efforts to bolster domestic critical mineral supply chains.",
    "China stated that emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, and disaster relief exports will be exempt from restrictions."
