  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers across the U.S. are raising alarm over the VA’s recent policy enforcement to limit long-term one-on-one therapy sessions, which has been intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since January 2025. Patients like Michael, a combat veteran with PTSD, report feeling abandoned when therapy is abruptly terminated, despite needing ongoing care. Providers say the policy, which caps sessions at 8–12 instead of the previously flexible 4–24 range, undermines clinical judgment, erodes trust, and fails to account for chronic conditions like PTSD. Many providers face disciplinary action for resisting these mandates, and some have resigned due to frustration. The VA denies that limits exist, asserting that care is patient-centered and collaboratively planned. However, experts including the American Psychological Association and former VA staff argue that long-term therapy is essential for recovery, especially for veterans with complex or lifelong mental health needs. Alternatives like group therapy are often unappealing or ineffective for patients who have built trust with specific therapists. The situation raises serious concerns about access, equity, and the ethical standards of care in the VA mental health system.",
