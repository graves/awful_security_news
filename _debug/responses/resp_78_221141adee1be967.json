  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a gun, marijuana, and cocaine. The government, including the Trump administration, argues that habitual drug users with firearms pose a public safety risk and that the law is supported by historical precedent. However, lower courts have previously ruled that such a ban cannot target habitual users, relying on a 2022 Supreme Court decision emphasizing the need for historical grounding in gun prohibitions. The case is significant because it raises fundamental questions about the Second Amendment, the scope of modern drug laws, and how historical context applies to current legislation. Notably, President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding a political dimension. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025, after hearing arguments in early 2026.",
