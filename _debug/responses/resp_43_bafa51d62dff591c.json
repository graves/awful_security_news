  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, even after a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who strongly opposed the idea. While Trump did not commit to providing the weapons during his planned meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. officials have prepared plans in case he decides to act. Ukrainian leaders see the missiles as a potential game-changer to pressure Russia into peace negotiations, while Putin argues that they could damage the U.S.-Russia relationship and threaten major cities. The threat is framed as a diplomatic leverage tool, not a direct escalation, and the possibility remains open as Trump continues to pursue a peace strategy, possibly influenced by recent diplomatic successes in the Middle East and a planned meeting in Budapest between Trump and Putin.",
