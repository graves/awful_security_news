This appeal follows a federal judge's prior denial of the deployment, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer claiming the ruling improperly limits presidential authority. The move is part of a broader pattern of Trump’s attempts to deploy military forces in cities like Los Angeles, Memphis, and Portland, citing crime and threats to ICE facilities, while facing legal challenges from state officials and courts. Governors like JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom oppose such actions, asserting they exceed executive authority. The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond by Monday, marking a pivotal moment in the national debate over executive power and federal-state relations. Future deployments are reportedly planned in cities including Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, St. Louis, Oakland, and San Francisco.",
