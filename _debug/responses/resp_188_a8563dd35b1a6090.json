  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is undergoing a major boardroom shake-up with seven members, including chairman Helge Lund and vice chair Henrik Poulsen, stepping down due to a disagreement with its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The foundation, which holds a three-quarter voting share, has pushed for a more extensive reconfiguration of the board, rejecting the board's proposal to simply add new members. This conflict follows years of market pressures, including competition from rivals like Eli Lilly, declining profits, and a shift in consumer demand from diabetes treatment to weight loss. The company’s stock dipped after the announcement, and the outgoing chairman, Helge Lund, cited the company’s failure to adapt quickly to market changes. The current chairman of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Lars Rebien Sorensen, is being proposed as the new chairman, marking a return to a long-standing leader with deep historical ties to the company.",
