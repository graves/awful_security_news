  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American media, fashion, and politics, tracing its roots to the 1880s Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and its reinforcement through Western films, political rhetoric, and conservative cultural values. While the cowboy has become ubiquitous — seen in fashion campaigns, TV shows like 'Yellowstone,' and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour — the article highlights that this image is largely a myth, rooted in romanticized and selective portrayals. Real cowboys were historically Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans, yet these contributions are often erased from mainstream narratives. The rise of cowboy fashion is tied to political trends, especially under conservative leaders like Donald Trump, who leveraged cowboy values of individualism and patriotism. Despite growing recognition of Black cowboys and diverse Western traditions, the trend remains heavily whitewashed, reflecting a cyclical pattern where cultural myths are re-entrenched despite historical inaccuracies. The article concludes that while the cowboy image is a powerful symbol of American identity, it obscures the true history and diversity of those who worked on the American frontier.",
