  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call to action to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. With climate change driving more frequent and severe disasters, the WMO highlights that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without such systems, and 90% of these deaths occur in developing nations. Despite progress—such as a rise in multi-hazard early warning systems from 52 to 108 countries—the assessment shows that 50% of countries have only basic capacity, and 16% have less. The article emphasizes that vulnerable regions, especially those affected by conflict or fragility, face the greatest risks. Real-world examples include the successful evacuation of Switzerland’s Blatten village in May 2025 due to a predicted glacier collapse, and widespread extreme weather events in 2025, including floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US. The WMO’s core message is that early warnings must translate into early action, empowering communities to respond and saving lives globally.",
