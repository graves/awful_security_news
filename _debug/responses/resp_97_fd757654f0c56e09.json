With the U.S. importing over 99% of its coffee and relying heavily on Brazilian and Colombian supplies, roasters like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting are facing rising costs and operational challenges. Consumers in major markets like Washington, D.C., are paying more, with average coffee prices rising by 3–4% year-over-year. Despite these pressures, coffee remains an affordable luxury, and consumers are likely to maintain consumption habits. In response, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' to exempt coffee from tariffs, signaling potential policy relief.",
