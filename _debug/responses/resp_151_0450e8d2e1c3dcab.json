  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed plans for a near-term summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, following Trump’s earlier announcement of a meeting in Hungary within two weeks. This comes amid growing tension over ceasefire conditions: Russia has demanded full control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and the dismantling of Ukrainian military capabilities, while Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy advocate for a freeze of current battle lines. A phone call between US Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was deemed sufficient, eliminating the need for further in-person meetings. Despite Russia maintaining that its position from the August Alaska summit remains unchanged, both Ukraine and European leaders accuse Moscow of stalling and continuing military actions. The delay in a Trump-Putin summit marks a significant setback in peace efforts and underscores a fundamental divergence in the conditions required for a lasting ceasefire.",
