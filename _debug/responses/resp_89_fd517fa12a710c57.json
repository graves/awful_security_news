  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing guns, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen who was indicted in 2023 after marijuana and cocaine were found at his home. The prosecution claims Hemani’s habitual marijuana use and alleged ties to Iran—linked to Qasem Soleimani—justify the ban. However, a lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots, and the Fifth Circuit ruled such prohibitions cannot target habitual users. The Trump administration appealed, arguing that drug-impaired users pose a danger to public safety. Hemani’s legal team challenges the law’s historical basis, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana, suggesting widespread overlap between legal drug use and gun ownership. The case is politically sensitive, highlighted by the prior conviction and pardon of Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in 2025 and issue a decision by the end of June 2025, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over Second Amendment rights and the limits of federal drug policy.",
