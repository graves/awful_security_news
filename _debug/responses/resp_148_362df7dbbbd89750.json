  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current Paris Agreement commitments, the world will still experience an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat. This represents a significant improvement over the worst-case scenario of 114 days, but still indicates a severe and growing threat. The study reveals a stark inequality in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat days (up to 149 per year), despite contributing only 1% of global emissions. In contrast, top emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity reflects a profound injustice and could fuel geopolitical instability, while emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will still face deadly heatwaves each year.",
