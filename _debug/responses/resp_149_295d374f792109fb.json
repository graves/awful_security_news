This policy, driven by concerns over Russia’s war in Ukraine, is part of a broader strategy to reduce energy dependence. While Hungary and Slovakia opposed the move due to their reliance on Russian energy and diplomatic ties with Moscow, the initiative passed due to a weighted majority of member states. The plan includes flexibilities for landlocked countries and is complemented by a new sanctions package targeting Russian LNG imports from January 2027. The move underscores a significant shift in European energy policy and security strategy.",
