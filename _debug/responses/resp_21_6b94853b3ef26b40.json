This recommendation, made after a 2023 habeas corpus petition cited new evidence—including a sworn statement from Roy Rosselló and a letter from Erik Menendez—suggests that the brothers endured severe physical and sexual abuse by their father. Gascón believes the brothers have rehabilitated, have served sufficient time, and are safe to reintegrate into society. The decision reflects evolving societal and legal understandings of abuse, particularly in light of public attention from the Netflix series and documentary. A hearing is expected within 30 to 45 days, and the brothers may become eligible for parole under California’s youthful offender provisions. The move is seen as a significant step in sentencing reform and a response to changing public attitudes on trauma, abuse, and justice.",
