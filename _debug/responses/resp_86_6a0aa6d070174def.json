  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive foreign policy toward Venezuela, marked by a surge in U.S. military activity—including B-52 bomber flights and a naval buildup—and the authorization of covert CIA operations. It highlights that these actions may reflect a broader trend of militarism in Trump’s second term. While Trump claims Venezuela is a threat due to drug and gang activity, these claims have been challenged by courts and intelligence agencies. The article emphasizes that public opinion is strongly against unilateral military intervention, with polls showing majority support for staying out of foreign conflicts and opposition to such actions without partner consent. The sudden retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, a key regional commander, suggests internal military concerns about these actions, reinforcing the perception that such actions are politically risky and widely unpopular with American citizens.",
