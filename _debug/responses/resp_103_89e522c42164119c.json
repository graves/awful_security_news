  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented a new policy to de-register international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, requiring them to undergo re-registration under strict ideological criteria, including approval from a committee that includes representatives from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. The process has been criticized by humanitarian groups as politically motivated, with organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps being denied access. Israel continues to ban the UNRWA from operating in Gaza, accusing it of employing Hamas members without evidence, despite UNRWA having been the primary provider of aid for decades. With only two of seven border crossings open and thousands of aid trucks stranded in Egypt and Jordan, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire. The ceasefire brokered by President Trump, which promised increased aid, has not been fulfilled, raising concerns about the effectiveness of international commitments and the broader implications for global humanitarian efforts in conflict zones.",
