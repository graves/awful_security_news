  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests have paralyzed Gabes, Tunisia, over environmental damage caused by the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which residents and activists blame for years of pollution, health crises, and ecological collapse. The plant, operational since 1972, has been linked to respiratory illness in over 200 patients and the deterioration of marine and land ecosystems. Despite a 2017 government pledge to phase it out, authorities have increased production, citing its economic importance. The powerful UGTT labour union led the protests, declaring them successful and threatening further action. President Kais Saied has described the crisis as an 'environmental assassination' and blamed past governments for public health and environmental damage. In response, Chinese companies have been deployed to manage emissions, marking a significant intervention in the crisis. The unrest reflects growing public anger and poses a major test of Saied’s authority since 2021.",
