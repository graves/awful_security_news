The move deepens an existing political crisis rooted in internal party conflict, particularly after Zandanshatar lost a leadership election to rival Amarbayasgalan Dashzegve, who later resigned amid corruption allegations. Zandanshatar's controversial mineral policy reforms—shifting royalty payments to domestic stock prices—and his appointment of a justice minister without parliamentary notification triggered significant backlash. This unrest follows broader public dissatisfaction with corruption and economic challenges in a resource-rich nation. The constitutional court has been scheduled to evaluate the president’s veto, signaling that the legitimacy of the political action remains under legal scrutiny.",
