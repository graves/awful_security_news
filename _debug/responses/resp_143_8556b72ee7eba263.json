  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In late October 2025, Russia launched a surgical drone and missile attack on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5, destroying a key power and heating facility. The strike, involving 465 drones and 32 missiles, follows a broader campaign since 2022 to target Ukraine’s energy infrastructure—power stations, heating systems, gas pipelines, and mines. Russia has upgraded its weapons with software that enables evasive flight patterns, drastically reducing interception rates. These attacks, combined with corruption in Ukraine’s anti-drone procurement, have left critical infrastructure vulnerable. As winter approaches with forecasted extreme cold, civilians are increasingly relying on generators, gas canisters, and alternative heating methods. Analysts warn that Ukraine may face a severe winter with widespread blackouts, marking a new phase in Russia’s asymmetric warfare strategy focused on civilian survival and societal collapse.",
