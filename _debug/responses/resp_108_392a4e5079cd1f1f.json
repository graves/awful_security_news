  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under the Biden-Harris administration, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing internal disunity, political vulnerability, and a failure to protect marginalized communities—including Black women—as key reasons for her departure. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she recounts her observations during the 2024 presidential debate, where President Biden’s health concerns intensified public scrutiny. She blames Democratic figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney for signaling doubt, which contributed to a fractured party image. Jean-Pierre also highlights systemic bias against Black women in political roles, noting that despite their strong loyalty, they were often overlooked. She attributes the party’s defeat to a lack of unity and foresight, particularly regarding policies like Project 2025. Her decision to identify as independent is framed not as a political defection, but as a call for accountability and a broader conversation on reimagining American politics and democracy.",
