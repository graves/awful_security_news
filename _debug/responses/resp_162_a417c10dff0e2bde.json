The project, which began on October 21, 2025, involves demolition and reconstruction of the two-storey East Wing — originally built in 1902 and long used for first lady offices and diplomatic visits — and is set to be completed before the end of Trump’s term in 2029. Despite not receiving formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission due to a government shutdown, the project proceeds under Trump’s assertion that it will not impact the main White House structure, will be funded privately, and will not cost taxpayers. The new ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet with a seating capacity of up to 999 people, significantly expanding space for state dinners and high-profile events. The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM.
