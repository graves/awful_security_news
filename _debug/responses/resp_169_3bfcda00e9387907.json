  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly financing illegal deforestation and land grabs in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas. The report, focused on the high-deforestation state of Pará, highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the lack of individual animal tracking, relying instead on group-level transit permits (GTAs) that cannot trace cattle origins. Cattle from illegally deforested land are allegedly moved through a 'laundering' system, obscuring their illegal origins before reaching JBS facilities. This failure undermines JBS’s ability to ensure compliance with environmental laws and raises serious ethical and environmental concerns. The report documents encroachments in protected Indigenous and sustainable areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where land grabbers have faced violence and impunity. While JBS and Brazilian authorities have made promises to improve traceability by 2026 and 2032 respectively, advocacy groups argue these timelines are too slow and that stronger, mandatory government action — including public access to GTA data — is urgently needed to stop deforestation and hold corporations accountable.",
