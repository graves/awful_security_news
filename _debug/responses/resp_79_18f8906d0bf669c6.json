  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House, under President Donald Trump, announced a major agreement to reduce the cost of three key IVF drugs — Gonal-F, Ovidrel, and Cetrotide — sold by EMD Serono (a U.S. subsidiary of Merck KGaA) through the new direct-to-consumer platform TrumpRx, set to launch in January 2026. The price reductions are expected to cut costs by over 70%, with the typical cost per cycle dropping from $5,000 to under $1,000. The deal includes a tariff reprieve for EMD Serono in exchange for increased U.S. manufacturing and R&D investment. Pfizer and AstraZeneca have also signed similar agreements to offer fertility drugs on TrumpRx as part of broader tariff relief. The administration encourages employers to offer IVF coverage as an optional benefit to remain competitive, but no federal mandate or government funding for IVF is included, falling short of Trump’s earlier campaign promise of universal free access. Experts caution that the deal only covers EMD Serono's drugs, leaving out major competitors like Organon and Ferring, and that access to IVF requires robust infrastructure, which is currently weakened by recent CDC staff cuts.",
