  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, with claims that he shared such data with family members lacking security clearances. The case differs from those of James Comey and Letitia James in that Trump did not directly pressure or replace prosecutors, and the charges are more serious due to allegations of a cyber breach by an Iranian-linked actor that exposed sensitive national defense data. While a federal judge in 2020 had already warned of Bolton’s potential violation of national security protocols, this indictment, brought by experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors and initiated under the Biden administration, suggests a more thorough and legally grounded investigation. Despite Trump’s long-standing public accusations and political targeting of Bolton—including stripping his security clearance and naming him on a 'deep state' list—the prosecution appears to be more legally substantiated than previous politically motivated cases. The stakes are higher than in the Comey or James cases, as the alleged exposure of classified information to hostile foreign actors raises broader national security concerns.",
