  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme (WFP) reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically short of the daily target of 2,000 tonnes, with only 750 metric tonnes entering via just two open crossings—Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara—due to the closure of others, including Rafah. Despite a slight increase in distribution points from five to 26, the WFP still falls far short of its goal of 145 distribution sites. The US-brokered ceasefire, supported by President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan, is seen as vital to enabling humanitarian access and preventing famine, especially in northern Gaza. Hamas has pledged to deliver the remains of 13 captives, with two more recently handed over, which is a condition for reopening Rafah. However, residents are storing food out of fear of future disruptions, and current supplies are only enough for half a million people for two weeks, underscoring the urgent need for expanded crossings and sustained international support.",
