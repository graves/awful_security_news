  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of sophisticated AI voice cloning scams have targeted Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using artificial intelligence to generate fake voices that sound indistinguishable from Defence Minister Guido Crosetto's. The scam, which occurred in early 2025 and involved requests for up to $1 million in funds, highlights the increasing realism and deception capabilities of AI-generated voices. A study by Queen Mary University of London found that voice clones were rated as more trustworthy than real voices, and global losses to deepfake fraud have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. The article underscores both the dangers—such as identity theft, fraud, and the creation of illegal sexual content—and the potential benefits of AI voice technology, like restoring speech for individuals with speech impairments. Regulatory actions in the U.S. and Australia demonstrate growing global concern and legal responses to these emerging AI threats.",
