The operation, described by Trump as targeting a drug-carrying submarine, marks the sixth known strike on such vessels and raises significant legal questions about the constitutional and statutory authority to detain individuals. The administration has claimed the operation targets 'narco-terrorists' and relies on Article II powers, though Congress has not authorized war against drug traffickers, and experts highlight potential legal challenges via habeas corpus petitions. The actions also tie into broader efforts to pressure Venezuela’s authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro, who is accused of offering resource access in exchange for diplomatic concessions. This marks a significant shift from traditional Coast Guard interdiction to large-scale, potentially illegal military operations with unresolved legal and ethical implications.",
