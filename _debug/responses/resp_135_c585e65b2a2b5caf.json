  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Jack Nicklaus, the legendary 18-time major champion in professional golf, has won a $50 million defamation verdict in a Florida lawsuit against his former business partners at the Nicklaus Companies. A six-person jury found that false claims—such as that Nicklaus planned to join the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf League and that he suffers from dementia—damaged his reputation and exposed him to public ridicule, hatred, and distrust. While Howard Milstein and Andrew O’Brien were named as individual defendants, the jury ruled against personal liability. The case emerged from a prior dispute where Nicklaus attempted to use his name independently for golf course design, which the company opposed. Although the company argued it was a business disagreement and not defamation, the jury concluded the false narratives constituted reputational harm. Nicklaus is now free to use his name for independent golf course design, though the company retains rights to market products with the 'Jack Nicklaus' logo.",
