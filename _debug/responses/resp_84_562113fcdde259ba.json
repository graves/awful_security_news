  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The resurgence of cowboy imagery across fashion, media, and politics in 2025 reflects a deep-rooted cultural myth that has been romanticized and re-purposed for decades. While rooted in historical performance and Western films, the modern cowboy trend is driven by political conservatism, particularly under the Trump administration, which uses cowboy symbolism to convey patriotic, individualist, and anti-urban values. Brands like Sweetgreen and Canada Goose, along with TV shows such as 'Yellowstone' and 'Landman,' have amplified the trend. However, the narrative is deeply problematic: it whitewashes the reality that cowboys were historically Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans, and ignores the hardships of rural labor. The cultural shift is now being challenged by contemporary visibility of Black cowboys through Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour, photography by Gabriela Hasbun, and increased public interest in Black rodeo events. Despite these efforts, mainstream media and political discourse continue to promote a sanitized, idealized version of the cowboy, showing a cyclical pattern of mythologizing, commercializing, and then erasing the diverse, real-life history behind it.",
