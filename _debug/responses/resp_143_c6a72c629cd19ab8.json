    "China has expanded its export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and maintaining restrictions on seven previously listed metals (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium).",
    "The restrictions apply to both rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used in refining them, with foreign companies needing special approvals to export products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five previously uncontrolled ones, and restricted access to specialized refining equipment. The controls, effective from December 1, 2025, are justified on national security grounds due to concerns over foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes. This move comes just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, where it is seen as a strategic signal to strengthen China’s leverage in trade negotiations. The US, the world’s largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruptions in its defence and civilian technology industries, including for fighter jets, submarines, and AI-based semiconductors. Analysts interpret the action as a deliberate 'pre-meeting choreography' to highlight China’s dominance in the rare-earth supply chain and to pressure the US during negotiations, while acknowledging humanitarian exemptions for emergencies.",
