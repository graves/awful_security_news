  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran, particularly intensified from 2012 onward, have significantly harmed the country’s middle class—historically a driving force behind political reform and social stability. A study in the European Journal of Political Economy using a synthetic control method reveals that without sanctions, Iran’s middle class would have grown by 17% between 2012 and 2019, but instead shrank by 28%. Rising inflation, unemployment (up to 9.2%), and soaring prices of basic goods have made daily life difficult, especially for young, educated professionals. Sanctions have funneled economic benefits to state-linked institutions like the IRGC and bonyads, weakening civil society and entrepreneurship. This has shifted political engagement from demands for reform to cries for survival, increasing social fragmentation and vulnerability to repression. As a result, Iran faces a deepening wealth gap, a shrinking middle class, and an unstable political landscape, with experts warning that rebuilding the middle class is a generational challenge.",
