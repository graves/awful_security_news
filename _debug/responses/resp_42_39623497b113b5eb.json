  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports that the U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass the required 12 appropriations bills. This marks a continuation of political deadlock, echoing the 2018 shutdown — the longest in nearly 50 years, which lasted 35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, and cost the nation an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The 2018 shutdown was partial, with some agencies operating and about 300,000 employees furloughed, while the current shutdown is full, affecting all federal operations. The article attributes the ongoing impasse to deep political polarization, a narrow Republican House majority, and the inability to overcome Senate filibusters. It also notes that government shutdowns have declined in frequency since 1990, but partisan gridlock continues to delay funding resolutions.",
