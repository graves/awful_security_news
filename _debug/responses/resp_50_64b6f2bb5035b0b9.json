  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th-anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live-fire demonstration using 155mm artillery shells fired over the I-5 interstate highway — a route not used since the 1950s. One of the shells prematurely detonated at a high altitude, sending fragments that struck and damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. While no injuries were reported, the incident raised significant safety concerns, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to close the highway and call the firing 'dangerous.' The Marine Corps has not clarified the decision to fire over the highway or the integrity of the shell batch, which had previously been used successfully in similar demonstrations. The incident is viewed as abnormal due to the premature detonation, despite theoretical safety measures. Background context includes a surge in U.S. 155mm shell production (more than tripling since 2022) driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia, and prior manufacturing issues revealed in a 2024 Reuters investigation, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive composition that was later reversed to TNT for production efficiency. The demonstration, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reflects broader military traditions of showcasing strength during high-profile visits, but highlights the risks of public safety when such events involve live ordnance over civilian infrastructure.",
