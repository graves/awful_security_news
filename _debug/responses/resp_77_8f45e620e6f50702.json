  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man who allegedly faked his death in 2020 to evade arrest on rape charges, to a prison term of between five years and life in prison. Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was identified in 2018 through a DNA match from a decade-old rape kit. After being falsely reported as deceased via an online obituary, he fled the U.S. and was arrested in Scotland in 2021 based on distinctive tattoos and an Interpol notice. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 and convicted in two separate cases involving rapes in northern Utah in 2008. The victim in the first case described a pattern of manipulation and abuse, including financial exploitation and coercive control. Rossi, a known flight risk and serial abuser, used multiple aliases, including Arthur Knight, to evade justice and was previously wanted in Rhode Island for failing to register as a sex offender. The case underscores the dangers of predatory behavior, the importance of DNA backlog efforts, and the resilience of justice systems in tracking fugitives.",
