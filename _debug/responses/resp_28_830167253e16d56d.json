    "President Donald Trump has filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court to authorize the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, asserting that lower courts have improperly blocked the deployment.",
    "The administration claims that federal officials in Chicago have faced violent threats and attacks, including a pre-planned ambush, justifying the need for National Guard intervention.",
    "Lower courts, particularly the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, have previously blocked such deployments, arguing that Trump overstated the emergency and encroached on executive authority.",
    "The Trump administration cites the 1827 Supreme Court case *Martin v. Mott*, which established that only the president has the authority to determine if a national emergency exists, and asserts that this precedent supports their claim of unfettered executive power.",
    "Opposing state officials and legal scholars argue that such deployments exceed the president's discretion and reference the 1932 case *Sterling v. Constantin*, which allows courts to review executive decisions that fall outside a 'range of honest judgment'.",
    "The Supreme Court has previously sided with Trump in most of his emergency deployments, suggesting a favorable precedent for this case.",
    "The Supreme Court has requested a response from state and local officials by Monday evening, indicating a fast-paced and urgent review process.",
    "The case underscores a broader constitutional debate over presidential power, especially concerning the use of military forces on U.S. soil during domestic unrest."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, citing a pre-planned attack on federal personnel and property as a national emergency. The administration argues that lower courts, including the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, improperly blocked the deployment by overstepping executive authority, relying on the precedent of *Martin v. Mott* to assert that only the president can determine the existence of a national emergency. In contrast, state officials and judges like April Perry argue that protests do not equate to riots and that courts can review executive decisions when they fall outside a reasonable range of judgment, citing *Sterling v. Constantin*. The Supreme Court has previously favored Trump in similar cases and has requested a response from state and local officials by Monday, signaling a swift and high-stakes review of presidential power in domestic emergencies.",
