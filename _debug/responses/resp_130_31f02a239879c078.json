  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following a week of deadly cross-border fighting, marking the most serious crisis between the two nations in years. The conflict, triggered by a suicide bombing in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and a subsequent Pakistani airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, killed dozens and injured hundreds, including civilians and three local cricketers. The airstrike, which Pakistan claims targeted the militant group Hafiz Gul Bahadur, prompted strong condemnation from Afghan officials and led to a cricket series boycott. Qatar and Turkey mediated the ceasefire, with both nations agreeing to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and hold follow-up talks. Analysts note that the underlying issue—Afghanistan's role in supporting or harboring militants—remains unresolved, with the Taliban denying responsibility. The crisis threatens regional stability and could allow terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaida to resurface, highlighting the urgency of a sustainable peace settlement.",
