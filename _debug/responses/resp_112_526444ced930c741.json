  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge has ordered the Department of Defense to return books on race and gender to school libraries on military bases, following a lawsuit by 12 students from Virginia, Kentucky, Italy, and Japan. The students claimed that DoDEA officials removed nearly 600 books and canceled events—such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and Holocaust Remembrance Day—based on policies from President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, which banned discussion of Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and identity-based celebrations. The ACLU filed a motion arguing that the actions violated students’ First Amendment rights and created a climate of fear in classrooms. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the removals were not pedagogical but politically motivated, and ordered the immediate restoration of all removed books and curricular materials.",
