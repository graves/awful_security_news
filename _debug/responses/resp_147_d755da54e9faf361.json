  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters clashed with police in southwest Dublin on October 21, 2025, following allegations that a 26-year-old man—an asylum seeker who requested a Romanian interpreter—sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel in Saggart. The girl was reportedly under state care at the time. Protesters, carrying signs such as 'Irish lives matter' and chanting 'Get them out!', threw bottles and launched fireworks, leading to a violent confrontation where a police van was set on fire. The government, including Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan and Prime Minister Micheal Martin, condemned the protests as an unacceptable weaponization of a crime, calling the events 'extremely serious and very, very grave'. This incident follows a similar 2023 outbreak of far-right riots after a knife attack involving an Algerian suspect, and reflects a broader pattern of rising anti-immigration sentiment in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, particularly in response to incidents involving asylum seekers and children.",
