  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a sharp escalation of violence, Israel launched airstrikes across Gaza in response to Hamas attacks on Israeli troops in southern Gaza, claiming violations of a fragile ceasefire. Hamas denies involvement, accusing Israel of fabricating attacks and violating the agreement, while also asserting it was cut off from operations in Rafah. The U.S. State Department reported credible intelligence that Hamas was planning attacks on civilians, further straining ceasefire compliance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered retaliatory strikes, citing the deaths of two soldiers, Maj. Yaniv Kula and Staff-Sgt. Itay Ya'avetz, and the killing of a family of 11 in a bus attack in Gaza City. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., includes the release of 20 Israeli hostages and the return of bodies of deceased hostages, though 16 remain in Gaza. Both sides accuse each other of ceasefire breaches, with Gaza's media reporting 80 violations since the agreement began. This escalation threatens to undermine the fragile peace and deepen humanitarian and political crises in the region.",
