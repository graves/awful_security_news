  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a major legal defense against federal charges alleging false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding, arguing the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His attorneys claim the case stems from a personal vendetta, citing Trump’s public attacks on Comey, and assert that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was illegal, as it circumvented the required Senate confirmation process after her predecessor Erik Siebert’s 120-day term expired. The defense also argues for a lack of prosecutorial consistency, pointing to the Justice Department’s decision not to charge other top Trump administration officials. The case is notable for its constitutional implications, including potential violations of the Appointments Clause, and is being closely watched as a precedent for how political retaliation and executive overreach may be addressed in federal criminal proceedings.",
