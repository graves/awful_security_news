  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American teenager, has been detained in Israeli prisons since February 2023 after a military raid on his family’s home in the West Bank. He describes enduring severe conditions including cold, thin mattresses, extremely insufficient meals with no fruit or dinner, and physical abuse during arrest. He has lost significant weight and is charged with an accusation he denies. Human rights groups, including Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), argue that Israel is the only country that systematically prosecutes children in military courts. Despite being a US citizen, he has not received protection from the US government, with family and US lawmakers, including Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, urging President Donald Trump to intervene. The case has gained urgency following the Gaza ceasefire deal, which led to the release of other Palestinian detainees and renewed global attention. Meanwhile, at least 79 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli jails since October 2023 due to lack of medical care and poor conditions. The situation raises serious concerns about child rights, international diplomacy, and the safety of US citizens in occupied territories.",
