  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen detained 20 United Nations employees, including five Yemenis and 15 international staff, at a facility in the Hada neighborhood of Sanaa. The rebels confiscated all communication equipment, and the UN has responded by contacting the Houthis and other parties to resolve the situation and restore full control of its facilities. The incident follows a pattern of Houthi crackdowns on UN personnel, including prior detentions in Saada and Hodeida, and is part of a broader campaign accusing UN staff of spying—claims the UN has denied. This escalation has led to the suspension of UN operations in Saada and the relocation of key humanitarian leadership to Aden, reflecting a deepening humanitarian crisis and increased instability in Yemen’s conflict zones.",
