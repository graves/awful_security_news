    "Trump's plan to build a new $250 million ballroom in the White House East Wing represents the first structural change to the White House since 1948 and the first under a Trump administration.",
    "The project, announced in July 2024 and confirmed on Truth Social in October 2025, aims to address the long-standing lack of a dedicated large-scale ballroom for hosting state dinners and international events.",
    "Despite not receiving formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission — currently closed due to a government shutdown — the project has proceeded, raising questions about regulatory oversight and executive authority.",
    "The new ballroom is estimated to be 90,000 square feet with a seating capacity of 650–999 people, significantly larger than the current East Room, which seats about 200.",
    "The project is being funded privately by Trump and private donors, though no specific donors have been named, and claims of zero cost to taxpayers have drawn skepticism.",
    "The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and used since 1977 for first lady offices and diplomatic visitor entrances, will be reconstructed without demolition of the main White House structure.",
    "The project involves two-storey reconstruction and is being led by Washington-based McCrery Architects, with construction by Virginia-based Clark Construction and engineering by Dallas-based AECOM.",
    "The ballroom will be located adjacent to, but not touching, the main White House building, with Trump emphasizing respect for its historical integrity.",
    "The White House has undergone numerous structural changes since its construction in 1792, including damage in 1814 and redesigns by each president since George Washington."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to build a $250 million new ballroom in the White House’s East Wing, marking the first structural change to the residence since 1948 and the first under his administration. The project, which began in late October 2025, aims to address longstanding concerns about the lack of space for hosting state dinners and international events, with Trump claiming the cost will be funded privately and not burden taxpayers. Despite no formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission — currently closed due to a government shutdown — construction has proceeded. The new ballroom, estimated at 90,000 square feet with a seating capacity of up to 999 people, will be built adjacent to but not touching the main White House building. The East Wing, historically used for first lady offices and diplomatic access since 1977, will be reconstructed under the leadership of McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM. The project has raised concerns about historical preservation, safety (due to the wing’s proximity to an underground emergency bunker), and regulatory oversight, especially given the absence of prior federal approval. The White House, originally built in 1792 by architect James Hoban and damaged in 1814 during the War of 1812, continues to be a symbol of presidential power and public symbolism.",
