  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has publicly urged vaccination in response to growing concerns that federal officials—such as former President Donald Trump and CDC advisory bodies—are undermining public health through misleading claims and policy changes. These include the recent recommendation against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4 and false claims about vaccine dosing. As a result, vaccination rates have declined, leading to outbreaks like measles in South Carolina, with over 100 unvaccinated students quarantined. The coalition emphasizes that public health decisions must be grounded in science, not political ideology, and stresses the importance of local collaboration across jurisdictions. Meanwhile, trust in federal health agencies like the CDC has declined, with only half of U.S. adults currently trusting them to provide reliable information. The article highlights a broader crisis in public health governance, where political interference threatens both scientific integrity and community safety.",
