  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) that would warn about a possible link between its use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. The FDA has not found clear evidence of a causal connection and maintains that current use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is safe. This controversy was sparked by President Donald Trump's public statement suggesting pregnant women avoid Tylenol, despite no scientific support, and by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advocating for public health campaigns and label changes. The Informed Consent Action Network filed a citizen petition urging stronger warnings, but major studies—including one of over 2 million children—show no significant links between acetaminophen and autism or ADHD. Regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada have affirmed the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy, reinforcing scientific consensus. Kenvue argues that proposed label changes are arbitrary and unsupported by evidence, and that the existing 'ask a health professional' guidance is appropriate.",
