  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new public schools superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a controversial mandate introduced by former Superintendent Ryan Walters that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and incorporated into student lesson plans for grades 5 through 12. The policy, which drew condemnation from civil rights groups and prompted a pending lawsuit, was seen as an attempt to promote religion in public education. Fields, appointed by Governor Kevin Stitt, emphasized that such religious instruction decisions should remain with individual school districts and that spending taxpayer funds on Bibles is not appropriate. The decision reflects a broader effort to reassess and potentially rescind other controversial mandates from Walters' tenure, including ideological exams for teachers from California and New York, and standards promoting conspiracy theories around the 2020 election. The move has been welcomed by plaintiffs in the lawsuit as a necessary step toward ending religious indoctrination in public schools.",
