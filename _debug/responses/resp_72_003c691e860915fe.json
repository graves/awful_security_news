    "The Trump administration released two alleged 'narco-terrorists' — survivors of a failed strike on a submarine in the Caribbean — without detaining them or providing public evidence of their involvement in drug trafficking or imminent threat to U.S. safety.",
    "This action undermines the administration's claims of engaging in a war against 'narco-terrorists' and raises serious questions about the legality and proportionality of the strikes, especially without congressional approval or public evidence.",
    "Legal experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, argue that releasing individuals deemed dangerous under the administration’s claims contradicts the logic of military targeting and implies a lack of due process.",
    "The decision to release the men instead of detaining them or prosecuting them in U.S. courts avoids legal challenges, including habeas corpus proceedings, which could have forced the administration to justify its actions in court.",
    "Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts, have challenged the administration’s assertions that the targets were involved in fentanyl trafficking, citing geographical and logistical inconsistencies.",
    "The lack of transparency in the administration’s legal justification and its failure to provide evidence has led to skepticism about the claims of imminent danger and warfare.",
    "Republican lawmakers, including Senator Todd Young, have expressed concern over the legality and congressional oversight of the strikes, signaling growing political scrutiny.",
    "Congress, currently distracted by a government shutdown, has been slow to act, but recent events may prompt a bipartisan effort to halt or review the strikes."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced intense scrutiny after releasing two survivors of a failed strike on a drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, claiming they were 'narco-terrorists.' The decision to release them — without public evidence, legal justification, or prosecution — undermines the administration’s narrative of a wartime campaign against drug trafficking. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Jack Goldsmith, argue that the actions violate due process, lack transparency, and contradict the logic of military targeting. The move raises serious legal and ethical questions about whether the administration is conducting unauthorized warfare, and whether it is avoiding accountability by handing off individuals to their home countries. The lack of congressional oversight and public evidence has led to growing bipartisan concern, especially as lawmakers like Senator Todd Young voice alarm over the legality and democratic legitimacy of the strikes.",
