  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly contributing to illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas of Pará state. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing illegally deforested cattle to be 'laundered' through a system of transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual animal records. This opacity enables deforestation, land grabs, and violence against Indigenous communities, particularly in protected zones like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. Despite JBS’s 2009 pledge to trace all suppliers and a 2023 state decree requiring full traceability by 2026, enforcement remains weak. Experts and environmental groups argue that the current system is inadequate and that stronger, transparent, publicly accessible traceability mechanisms — including federal-level mandates — are urgently needed to hold corporations and governments accountable for environmental harm.",
