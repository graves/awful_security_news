  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a significant escalation of its full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia launched a massive assault on the Chernihiv region, using over 100 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles to strike electricity generation facilities. The attack caused a total blackout affecting hundreds of thousands, killed four people, and injured ten, including a 10-year-old girl. The strikes have also disrupted water supply due to the loss of pumping stations, forcing residents to rely on bottled water. Officials, including Andriy Podorvan, state that the attacks target civilian infrastructure—not military objectives—and believe this reflects a misjudgment of public resilience. Despite the devastation, Ukrainian civilians remain united, with many continuing daily routines and supporting each other. The broader concern is the long-term economic and psychological toll, with energy recovery hampered by limited equipment availability—such as transformers that take over a year to produce. International support, particularly from US energy companies, is being sought to help modernize and restore Ukraine’s energy systems. The incident highlights the growing focus of Russia’s strategy on civilian infrastructure as a means of undermining national stability.",
