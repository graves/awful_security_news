  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal government shutdown has placed millions of Americans at risk of losing access to food stamps (SNAP) in November, as the USDA warns that the program will run out of funds within two weeks. The Trump administration has not committed to emergency funding, unlike its earlier actions to support other programs, and has instead relied on tariff revenue to sustain WIC, which is insufficient for SNAP. This has led to 17 states halting new food stamp applications due to payment constraints. Critics, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul and advocacy groups, argue that the administration is prioritizing political agendas over food security, especially during the Thanksgiving season when food access is most critical. The situation highlights the fragility of federal safety net programs during political gridlock.",
