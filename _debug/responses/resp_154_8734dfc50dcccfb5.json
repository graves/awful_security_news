  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 known rare-earth metals, including five newly added metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium), and restricted access to refining equipment. These measures, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals detailing the use of the products, citing national security concerns over military applications. The announcement comes just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling China’s effort to strengthen its negotiating leverage in ongoing trade talks. As the United States is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products—used in critical defense systems like F-35 jets and submarines, and in civilian technologies such as electric vehicles and AI—this move significantly threatens US technological and industrial resilience. Analysts interpret the action as strategic signaling, designed to pressure the US during diplomatic negotiations while highlighting the deep interdependence of the two economies, even as they navigate rising geopolitical tensions.",
