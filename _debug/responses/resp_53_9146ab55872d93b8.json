  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American media, fashion, and politics, tracing its roots to 19th-century entertainment and romanticized Western tropes. While historically tied to nationalism and conservative political values—such as under the Trump administration—it is now heavily commercialized through fashion brands, TV shows like 'Yellowstone,' and celebrity culture, including Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour. However, the article highlights a critical gap: mainstream portrayals ignore the real history of cowboys, who were predominantly Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. The rise of Black cowboy culture—documented by photographers like Gabriela Hasbun and celebrated in events like the Bill Pickett Rodeo—challenges these whitewashed narratives. Though the current cowboy trend reflects a cultural and political alignment with conservatism, it also signals a growing public interest in the diversity and complexity of Western American history.",
