  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS reported a system outage on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, that disrupted prescription filling and pickup at some of its 9,000 U.S. locations due to a network connection issue. The company apologized and confirmed service had been restored. The event coincided with a major outage at Amazon Web Services, which affected critical services like hospital communications, banking, and smart home devices, highlighting the growing societal dependence on cloud-based systems and the risks when these systems fail. While the CVS outage appears unrelated to its recent acquisition of Rite Aid locations, both incidents underscore the fragility of modern digital infrastructure in everyday life.",
