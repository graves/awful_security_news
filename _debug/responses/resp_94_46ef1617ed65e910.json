  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears while running in the woods near Myoko, Japan, in early October 2025. The attack resulted in severe injuries, including a bite to his arm and leg, requiring multiple surgeries. This incident is part of a broader trend of rising bear attacks in Japan — over 100 injuries and seven deaths reported in 2025 — which experts attribute to climate change disrupting bear food sources and forcing bears into human areas. In response, the Japanese government has announced stricter bear control measures. Halloran, despite significant physical and emotional trauma, remains determined to return to running in nature, supported by the local running community. The story underscores both a growing public safety crisis in Japan and the personal resilience of individuals facing extreme wildlife encounters.",
