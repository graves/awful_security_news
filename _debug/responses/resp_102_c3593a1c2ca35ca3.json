  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen heist on October 19, 2025, four masked men broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris using a basket lift to gain access through a second-floor window in the Galerie d'Apollon, where they stole several 'priceless' royal jewels, including the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie. Armed with chainsaws and box cutters, the suspects smashed display cases and fled on Yamaha TMax scooters, attempting to set the vehicle on fire. Two stolen items were later found abandoned near the museum. French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez described the operation as highly organized, lasting only seven minutes and carried out by a very experienced team. The incident is part of a troubling trend of museum thefts in France, including a $700,000 gold theft from the National Museum of Natural History and an $11 million porcelain theft from the Adrien Dubouché National Museum in Limoges earlier in September. The Louvre remains closed to preserve evidence, and all central police units in Paris are actively involved in the investigation.",
