    "The Tomahawk cruise missile is a proven, effective, and relatively affordable weapon in the US arsenal, with a range of 1,600 to 2,500 kilometers and high precision, making it suitable for long-range strikes.",
    "Ukraine has been lobbying for Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russian territory, such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast, to counter Russian military infrastructure.",
    "The US has limited supply of Tomahawks, with President Donald Trump stating that the US needs them for its own defense and that only a few are available for export to Ukraine.",
    "Ukraine would need a ground-launched system like the Typhon to use Tomahawks, which it currently lacks, and its own cruise missile program (the Flamingo) remains unproven and underdeveloped.",
    "Russia has responded with dire warnings of escalation, citing the nuclear-capable potential of Tomahawks, and the SVR head Sergey Naryshkin described their supply as a 'hostile move' threatening global security.",
    "While Tomahawks have been used in past conflicts (e.g., Gulf War, Iraq 1990–2003, Libya, Syria), they are primarily sea-launched and not yet deployable by Ukraine without appropriate launch infrastructure.",
    "The primary need for Ukraine remains robust air defense systems, as Russia intensifies attacks with drones and missiles, rather than long-range strike capability."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective US weapon used in multiple global conflicts, is being sought by Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory—such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast—as a means of retaliation and to pressure Russia into negotiations. However, the United States has limited supply of Tomahawks, with President Donald Trump emphasizing their need for domestic defense. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch infrastructure (like the Typhon system) to use them, and its own cruise missile program (Flamingo) remains underdeveloped and unproven. Russia has issued warnings that such a transfer would be a hostile act, potentially triggering escalation due to the missile’s nuclear capabilities. While Tomahawks offer significant destructive potential, Ukraine’s immediate priority remains strengthening its air defense systems against overwhelming Russian drone and missile attacks.",
