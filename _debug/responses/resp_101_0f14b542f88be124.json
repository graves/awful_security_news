  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has publicly distanced herself from the Democratic Party, identifying as an independent in her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.' She attributes the party's 2024 electoral loss to internal disunity, citing public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney expressing doubts about Biden’s fitness. Jean-Pierre recalls the heightened scrutiny she faced as a Black woman in a high-profile role, noting that she was often judged for her identity rather than her performance. She also emphasizes the loyalty of Black women voters, whom she claims were overlooked despite their crucial role in the party's base. Ultimately, her decision to become an independent is not a political defection but a call for accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics, urging citizens to avoid silence and actively participate in shaping a more inclusive and just democracy.",
