  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democratic congresswoman Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires all duly elected members to be sworn in, and that the Speaker has no constitutional authority to delay seating. Johnson claims he is following Nancy Pelosi’s precedent of delaying swearing-in after recess, but the lawsuit alleges this is a politically motivated tactic to avoid a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and to strengthen his position in budget negotiations. The case underscores a constitutional debate over the power of the Speaker to control the swearing-in process and raises concerns about democratic representation and accountability. Grijalva, who has not yet spoken to Johnson, is seeking a direct meeting to resolve the issue, while the lawsuit seeks a court order allowing a qualified third party to administer the oath if Johnson refuses.",
