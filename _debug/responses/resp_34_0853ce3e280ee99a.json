  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump suggested a dramatic price reduction for popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, proposing they could be sold at $150 per month—comparable to prices in the UK. The idea emerged during a news conference on IVF drug pricing, prompting a reaction from Dr. Mehmet Oz, who clarified it was not yet a finalized deal. While patients and doctors expressed hope for increased access, experts remain skeptical about feasibility, citing regulatory, financial, and systemic barriers. Stock prices for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dropped significantly, reflecting investor concern. Current drug prices in the US are extremely high—over $1,000 per month—leading many to rely on unregulated compounded versions. Experts warn that even $150 may not be sufficient, as affordability and access remain critical barriers. The proposal is framed within the administration’s 'Most Favored Nation' drug pricing framework, but no official commitments have been made. Patients like Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell highlight personal success and financial strain, underscoring the real-world impact of drug pricing on health outcomes and quality of life.",
