  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown positive signs of recovery, rising to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 — an increase of eight from the previous year. This follows a 25% population decline between 2010 and 2020, and represents a slow but steady trend of growth over the past four years. Scientists attribute this recovery to improved conservation measures, including new protections in Canada and reduced ship strikes and entanglements. While challenges remain — such as low reproduction rates and ongoing threats — recent data shows four mother whales produced calves, and some mothers are having shorter intervals between births. Experts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that the population's resilience is fragile and requires sustained protection. Environmental groups urge Congress to uphold existing laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act to ensure continued survival of this critically endangered species.",
