  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a dramatic escalation of diplomatic and military tension, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a reduction in financial aid to Colombia and the imposition of new tariffs on Colombian exports, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and failing to curb drug production. Trump claimed Colombia is a 'drug manufacturing machine' and threatened to take action on its own, citing a recent strike on a vessel linked to the National Liberation Army (ELN). Petro strongly rejected these claims, defending his administration’s efforts to combat drug trafficking and accusing the U.S. of assassinating a civilian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, during a September strike. Colombian officials described the U.S. actions as a violation of national sovereignty, while experts warn that cutting aid undermines Colombia’s capacity to fight both drug cartels and insurgencies. The conflict reflects a broader strain in U.S. policy in Latin America, where military operations in Venezuela and Colombia have intensified amid growing distrust between allies.",
