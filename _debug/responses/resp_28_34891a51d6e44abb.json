  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration’s imposition of steep tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—has significantly increased the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% year-over-year rise in retail coffee prices in August 2025. Despite the fact that a full 50% price increase in beans would not translate directly to a 50% increase in a cup of coffee, roasters like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting report higher operational costs and reduced profit margins. Consumers in key markets like Washington, D.C., are seeing prices rise, with hot coffee increasing to $4.21 and cold brew to $5.35. While some roasters are diversifying import sources to mitigate risks, the uncertainty and inflationary pressure have made small businesses question long-term viability. In response, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' in September 2025 to exempt coffee from tariffs, signaling political recognition of the economic burden on both consumers and small businesses.",
