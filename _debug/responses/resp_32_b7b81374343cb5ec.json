  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has officially identified the remains of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli military officer killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, as a deceased hostage. He is the 13th such victim to be returned since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9, 2025. The identification follows a process involving the Red Cross and Israeli forces, with Haimi’s body arriving in Tel Aviv for burial. Despite the ceasefire agreement requiring Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, Hamas has faced criticism for delays and even a prior misidentification of a body. The US, through President Donald Trump and envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, has applied diplomatic and political pressure on Hamas to comply. Israeli officials, including Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, stress that the return of all deceased hostages is a non-negotiable requirement under the ceasefire. The article highlights the ongoing challenges in recovering and identifying bodies due to war-related destruction and the complex humanitarian and political dynamics surrounding the ceasefire implementation.",
