  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Pakistan's mountainous regions, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as using gunfire, animal behavior, or natural signs to predict glacial floods—is proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems. Despite a $37 million investment in technology like the GLOF-II project, communities have expressed deep distrust due to frequent failures, lack of maintenance, and poor communication. Real-life examples, like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, show how traditional, human-based warning systems have successfully saved lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). These cases underscore the need for community trust, local participation, and integration of traditional knowledge into climate adaptation strategies, especially given Pakistan’s status as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations despite minimal carbon emissions.",
