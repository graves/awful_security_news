  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched two legal motions to dismiss federal charges alleging false statements and obstruction of Congress, claiming the prosecution is a retaliatory response to his public criticism of President Donald Trump. His attorneys argue that Trump personally targeted Comey, citing a pattern of public attacks, and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—after the 120-day limit expired—violates constitutional procedures by circumventing Senate confirmation. The case raises broader concerns about executive overreach, the protection of free speech, and the integrity of the judicial process in politically charged situations. A federal judge, Michael Nachmanoff, is presiding over the case, and experts suggest that the unique public statements from both Comey and Trump may make the court more receptive to claims of vindictive prosecution.",
