  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man, to five years to life in prison for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi, identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit, had allegedly faked his death by claiming he died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2020, prompting authorities to search for him. He fled to Scotland, where he was arrested while receiving treatment for COVID-19 due to distinctive tattoos, and later extradited to Utah in 2024. Prosecutors portrayed him as a flight risk and serial abuser, while Rossi maintained his innocence and claimed the victims were lying. The case underscores the importance of addressing rape kit backlogs, the dangers of false death claims, and international cooperation in tracking fugitives. Rossi is scheduled for sentencing in November for a second conviction, and a parole board will determine his release date.",
