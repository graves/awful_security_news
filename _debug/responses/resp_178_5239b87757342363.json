  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew's ability to live in the lavish Royal Lodge at Windsor, a Grade II-listed property, is explained by a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate in which he made substantial upfront payments—approximately £8 million—covering renovations and buying out future rent obligations. Despite the property being leased for 75 years (set to end in 2078), Prince Andrew pays no annual rent, and his financial responsibility includes maintaining the property, such as painting and repairing grounds. The arrangement, seen as financially beneficial to the Crown Estate due to the lack of public subsidy, has drawn public and political scrutiny amid renewed controversy over Prince Andrew's connections to Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual abuse by Virginia Giuffre. Critics, including government officials and opposition figures, argue that he should pay his fair share and move out of royal property, especially given the ongoing scandal and lack of transparency. The lease allows his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie to continue using the property, and financial details including a tapering return of payments after 25 years have raised questions about long-term accountability and taxpayer value.",
