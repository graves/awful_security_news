The coalition highlights a sharp decline in public trust in the CDC, with only half of Americans currently trusting its vaccine messaging, and cites a measles outbreak in upstate South Carolina—where over 100 unvaccinated students are quarantined—as evidence of real-world consequences. Local health officials stress that public health is a shared responsibility, with no administrative boundaries to prevent disease spread, and emphasize that science and data—not political ideology—should guide public health decisions. Meanwhile, major medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have distanced themselves from CDC guidance, signaling a deepening crisis in public health policy credibility.",
