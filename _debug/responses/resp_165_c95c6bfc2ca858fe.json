    "The Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist, best known for discovering dynamite.",
    "The prizes recognize individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind in the preceding year, with the first awards given in 1901 in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.",
    "In 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.",
    "Each prize is awarded by a different institution: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry, economics), the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet (medicine), the Swedish Academy (literature), and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).",
    "The prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.",
    "This year’s medicine prize was awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, which have laid the foundation for new research and treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The 2024 medicine prize went to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for discovering microRNAs that regulate gene expression.",
    "The 2024 physics prize was awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational work in machine learning and artificial neural networks.",
    "The 2024 chemistry prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using AI, including the development of AlphaFold.",
    "The 2024 literature prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist, for her poetic exploration of violence, identity, and collective trauma.",
    "The 2024 peace prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo for its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve survivor testimonies.",
    "The 2024 economic sciences prize was shared by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for their analysis of how inclusive institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality.",
    "The nomination process is highly secretive: nominations are submitted by experts, past winners, and academics by January 31, and nominations remain confidential for 50 years.",
    "Academic freedom is under threat due to political interference, as noted by Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, who criticized the Trump administration’s policies as damaging to scientific integrity.",
    "While Donald Trump has been widely discussed in relation to the 2025 peace prize due to claims about ending wars, experts argue his chances are slim because the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes durable peace, quiet institutional work, and anti-nuclear advocacy, not political self-promotion.",
    "Nominations for Trump were submitted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Pakistani government, though both occurred after the official nomination deadline for the 2025 prize."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full award schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. This year’s announcements follow decades of scientific progress, with prior winners including Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine), John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics), and David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry). In literature, Han Kang was honored for her literary exploration of trauma, while Nihon Hidankyo won the peace prize for its anti-nuclear advocacy. The 2025 peace prize has drawn significant attention due to claims by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly asserted that he deserves the award for ending wars. Experts argue that the Norwegian Nobel Committee prioritizes durable peace and institutional work over political self-promotion, and that Trump’s chances are slim. The nomination process remains confidential and strictly protected, with members prohibited from discussing decisions for 50 years. The Nobel Foundation manages the endowment, and each laureate receives a gold medal, diploma, and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million). The full ceremonies occur on December 10 in Stockholm and Oslo, with global media coverage and scientific and diplomatic participation.",
