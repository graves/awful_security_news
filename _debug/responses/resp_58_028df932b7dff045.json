  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and U.S. Secretary of Labor under Donald Trump, defended the 2008 non-prosecution plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing that a federal trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to unreliable victim testimony and jurisdictional issues. In a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta stated that the goal was to ensure Epstein served time and to send a clear signal that sexual exploitation would not go unpunished. He criticized the Palm Beach Sheriff for granting Epstein work release, which he said contradicted the office’s expectations of continuous incarceration. While Acosta denied any direct knowledge of Donald Trump being interviewed in the Epstein case or any connection between Trump and Epstein, the article highlights ongoing political controversy and public scrutiny over the deal, especially as media reports suggest Trump had known Epstein since the early 2000s. Acosta ultimately resigned from the Labor Secretary role in 2019, stating it was entirely his decision, not due to any official directive.",
