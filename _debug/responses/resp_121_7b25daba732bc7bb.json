  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The fourth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party, set to begin on Monday, is a critical internal meeting where leaders including Xi Jinping will finalize the next five-year economic plan (2026–2030). Occurring amid rising trade tensions with the United States — particularly under former President Donald Trump’s policies — the meeting emphasizes China’s push for technological self-sufficiency, especially in artificial intelligence and advanced chips. Despite a stable growth forecast of around 5%, domestic challenges such as the collapse of China’s property sector, low consumer confidence, and overcapacity in industries like auto manufacturing remain significant. Experts suggest that while the plan will follow familiar patterns, bolder actions are needed to stimulate consumer spending. The full plan will be formally released at the National People’s Congress in March 2026, and the Chinese leadership remains focused on stability, legitimacy, and national power as core objectives.",
