  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine coast, thousands of residents on the island of Catanduanes have evacuated due to risks of coastal flooding and strong winds. The storm is expected to pass near Catanduanes with gusts up to 80km/h and waves reaching 1.2 meters. This evacuation is part of a recurring drill, as Catanduanes is often the first landmass affected by Pacific cyclones. The Philippines faces frequent storms and earthquakes, with recent disasters including deadly quakes in Cebu and southern regions, and a prior typhoon, Ragasa, in September. Scientists warn that increasing storm intensity is linked to climate change, raising long-term concerns for disaster resilience in the region.",
