  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, a member of the British royal family, has agreed to stop using royal titles such as Duke of York amid growing public and political pressure stemming from revelations about his prolonged association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Despite this, he still officially holds the title due to its royal bestowal by Queen Elizabeth II. The controversy intensified after new emails revealed Andrew’s continued contact with Epstein, and days before the publication of Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s memoir, which alleges she had sex with Andrew when she was 17 and that he treated her as if it were his 'birthright.' Andrew previously denied the claims and stepped down from royal duties after a controversial 2019 BBC interview. A 2022 out-of-court settlement was reached, acknowledging Giuffre’s suffering but not wrongdoing. Critics, including opposition politician Stephen Flynn and Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts, are demanding the formal removal of Andrew’s titles, including his prince status, arguing that the public and victims are 'angry and aghast.' The UK government supports the palace’s actions but refrains from unilateral intervention, citing constitutional monarchy principles. Additionally, the Metropolitan Police are investigating whether Andrew in 2011 asked a bodyguard to investigate Giuffre’s background, and questions remain about the financing and ethics of Andrew’s residence at Royal Lodge, a property leased from the Crown Estate.",
