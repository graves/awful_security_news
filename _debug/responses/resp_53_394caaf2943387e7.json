  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a resurgence of trade tensions between the United States and China, following a previous truce. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 130% tariffs on Chinese exports and export controls on critical software, citing China's new restrictions on rare-earth minerals as a hostile move. China, in response, has imposed export limits on five additional rare-earth elements and mandated licenses for mining and processing, claiming these actions protect national security. These developments follow a series of retaliatory actions by both sides—such as U.S. restrictions on Huawei and tariffs on Chinese ships—triggering a cycle of mutual economic pressure. While both leaders have expressed hope for a resolution, including a planned meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, the situation remains precarious and could rapidly escalate into a deeper trade war.",
