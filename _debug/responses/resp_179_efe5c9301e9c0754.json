  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO, during a 2022 expedition to the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia, discovered two new deep-sea species: a semi-transparent porcelain crab about 1.5cm in size that uses hairs to feed on plankton, and a glowing West Australian Lantern Shark up to 40cm long found at depths over 600 meters. These discoveries, part of a broader effort to explore Australia’s uncharted marine environments, highlight the country's role as a global biodiversity hotspot. So far, at least 20 species have been identified, with scientists estimating 600 more remain to be formally described due to the time required for verification. The findings underscore the importance of deep-sea exploration in expanding scientific knowledge of Earth’s unsung ecosystems.",
