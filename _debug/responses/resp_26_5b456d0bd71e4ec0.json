  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where it could bring over a foot of rain, leading to dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the storm could bring rough seas and rip currents along the East Coast, with Florida and Cuba at risk if Melissa takes a different track. Melissa’s development is linked to the unusually warm waters of the Caribbean, which are fueling rapid intensification—a trend attributed to climate change. The article highlights the broader pattern of increasing storm intensity in the Atlantic, with three of the four named hurricanes this season undergoing extreme rapid intensification. As Melissa’s track remains uncertain, forecasters are monitoring two scenarios: one with a northward turn toward Hispaniola and another with a westward movement toward Central America.",
