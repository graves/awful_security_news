  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military has conducted a significant and sustained buildup in the Caribbean over the past two months, including the reopening of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and advanced surveillance aircraft such as P-8 Poseidons and AC-130J Ghostriders. These actions, including live-fire training and flights near Venezuela’s coast, are being interpreted as part of a broader pressure campaign targeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, rather than a plan for an invasion. While the US does not have the force for a full invasion, it retains the capability to conduct long-range Tomahawk missile strikes. Experts including Elliott Abrams and Peter Singer describe the operations as a strategic signal to rattle Venezuela, with the goal of weakening its political stability and deterring drug trafficking and regime resilience, especially amid Venezuela’s strong air defenses and challenging terrain.",
