Ukrainian officials allege that Russian tactics involve deliberate drone circling to prolong recovery and increase suffering. In response, Ukraine has launched long-range missile attacks on Russian facilities like the Bryansk Chemical Plant and is seeking increased military and financial support from European allies. Key figures such as President Volodymyr Zelensky are turning to Europe to secure resources, including funds from frozen Russian assets and Patriot air defense systems. The European Union, including Germany, is considering large-scale financial loans, while Ukrainian leaders express concern over a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Putin. Analysts note a pattern: when Western leaders like Donald Trump show frustration with Russia, Moscow intensifies attacks, indicating a strategic back-and-forth in the conflict.",
