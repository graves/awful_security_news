  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are revisiting the long-standing mystery of a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While the glow has long been attributed to pulsars or old stars, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk show that dark matter — specifically, a squashed, egg-shaped distribution — could also produce the observed glow. This matches the shape of the galactic bulge, lending new credibility to the dark matter theory. Although no direct evidence of dark matter has been found, the study suggests a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to definitively confirm or rule out this theory. The discovery would represent a major breakthrough in physics, potentially confirming WIMPs as dark matter particles and solving one of the century-old puzzles in science.",
