  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has intensified its pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, using a combination of diplomatic severance, economic sanctions, military operations, and a significant increase in the bounty on Maduro from $15 million to $50 million. This strategy, initially initiated in 2019 with the recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido, has evolved into a more assertive posture, including threats of military force and official authorization for CIA operations to disrupt drug trafficking from Venezuela. Despite Maduro’s re-election being widely condemned as illegitimate, U.S. diplomatic ties remain severed, and the administration continues to frame its actions as necessary to counter narco-trafficking, though critics suggest these measures could serve as a cover for regime change.",
