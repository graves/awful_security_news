  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the sharp rise in supermarket orange juice prices in the UK, which have increased by 134% since 2020, driven by a complex mix of global supply chain disruptions. Key factors include citrus greening disease reducing orange yields in Brazil and Florida, extreme weather, over-reliance on a few exporters, rising trade tariffs (especially US tariffs on Brazilian juice), and new packaging regulations. As a result, manufacturers are substituting oranges with cheaper alternatives like mandarins and mangoes. The article also highlights that this price surge is not isolated — it reflects a broader pattern of inflation in groceries (beef, butter, chocolate, milk). Experts suggest that retailers may have delayed passing on costs, and the UK’s heavy dependence on imported food makes it vulnerable to global shocks. While Brazil’s harvest has improved, global demand has fallen, and long-term solutions like AI-driven disease research are underway. The article concludes that food price volatility is likely to persist, with the UK facing ongoing exposure to climate and supply chain risks.",
