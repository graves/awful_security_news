  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Roman Surovtsev, a stateless immigrant from the former Soviet Union, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in in August 2025 despite having no valid citizenship documentation or viable deportation pathway. ICE attempted to deport him to Ukraine, a country that cannot provide travel documents and is in active war with Russia, making the removal both legally and humanly dangerous. His wife, Samantha, mobilized legal resources and successfully vacated his prior carjacking conviction, restoring his green card eligibility. The case raises significant concerns about due process, mass detention, and the human cost of the Trump administration’s goal of deporting one million people annually. Legal arguments, including habeas corpus, assert that the re-detention is unconstitutional and that the government is attempting to deport someone to a country where removal is effectively a death sentence. Surovtsev's case exemplifies how systemic immigration enforcement fails stateless individuals and undermines constitutional protections, highlighting the need for fair and compassionate treatment in immigration proceedings.",
