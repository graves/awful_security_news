  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a vulnerable island in the Philippines, evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approached, bringing strong winds up to 80km/h and a risk of coastal flooding from waves as tall as 1.2 meters. The government weather service issued warnings of a 'minimal to moderate' flood risk, and local officials activated evacuation plans for high-risk zones, including coastal areas and landslide-prone slopes. This event occurs amid a broader context of increasing natural disasters in the Philippines, including recent earthquakes and typhoons such as those in Cebu and southern regions, and reflects growing concerns about climate change intensifying storm strength. The evacuation in Catanduanes, which is often the first landmass affected by western Pacific cyclones, is part of a recurring drill, indicating both preparedness and ongoing vulnerability in disaster-prone communities.",
