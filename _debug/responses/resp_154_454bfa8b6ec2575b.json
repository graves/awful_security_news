The provincial government activated evacuation plans for high-risk coastal and landslide-prone areas, a routine response given the islandâ€™s frequent exposure to cyclones. This event occurs amid a broader context of ongoing natural disasters, including recent deadly earthquakes in Cebu and southern Philippines, and typhoons such as Typhoon Ragasa. Experts warn that the increasing intensity of storms is linked to climate change, raising concerns about the long-term resilience of disaster-prone communities in the Philippines.",
