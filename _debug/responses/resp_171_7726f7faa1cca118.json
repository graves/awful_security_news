  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, adding five new metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—to existing restrictions. The controls also target specialized equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, with most restrictions set to take effect on December 1, 2025. China justifies the move under national security concerns, citing dual-use applications and unauthorized transfers of materials to military entities. The US, the world’s largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and a key user in defence and civilian technologies like electric vehicles and AI, is directly affected. Analysts interpret this as a strategic signal before a high-stakes Trump–Xi meeting at the APEC summit, demonstrating China’s leverage in trade negotiations and deepening the US industrial and defence vulnerability. Exemptions are provided for emergency medical and disaster relief purposes, preserving critical access during public health crises.",
