  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The construction of Donald Trump’s new $250 million White House ballroom, which began in October 2025, has sparked intense scrutiny over its funding model. While Trump claims to personally pay for much of it and says some donors will contribute more than $20 million, the list of potential donors—including tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Blackstone, as well as sports figures like Woody Johnson and the Glazers—raises ethical concerns. YouTube has pledged $22 million as part of a settlement over the Capitol riot, and the Trust for the National Mall is managing the donations. Critics, including former ethics lawyer Richard Painter, argue that the arrangement amounts to a 'pay-to-play' scheme, where corporations gain access to the administration in exchange for contributions. Although the White House maintains the project does not cost taxpayers and will benefit future administrations, the potential for political influence and lack of transparency have led to significant public and legal debate.",
