  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Although Donald Trump is not on the ballot in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, both parties are heavily leveraging his influence. Republicans, led by Jack Ciattarelli, are actively promoting Trump’s support through messages and rallies, while Democrats, led by Mikie Sherrill, are using Trump’s policies—such as the cancellation of the Gateway tunnel project and the political shift in Passaic County—as key arguments to rally voters. The races are seen as early indicators of public sentiment toward Trump’s second term and could provide critical insights for both parties heading into the 2026 midterms. Democrats are especially concerned about voter loyalty in swing areas and are banking on 'voters’ remorse' to reverse political trends. Meanwhile, the campaigns are engaging in heated rhetoric, with ads and debate performances directly referencing Trump’s performance and policies, underscoring his continued centrality in the national political discourse.",
