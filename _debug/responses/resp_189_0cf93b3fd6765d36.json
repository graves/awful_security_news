Sarkozy has maintained his innocence and launched an appeal, claiming the prosecution is politically motivated and driven by revenge. He is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison in Paris, where he has limited contact with others and restricted movement. The case has sparked significant public and political debate, with President Emmanuel Macron acknowledging the emotional impact, and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin agreeing to visit him. France’s highest administrative court will deliver its verdict on the appeal in late November 2025, potentially overturning or affirming the conviction.",
