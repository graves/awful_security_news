Fans, including those who were previously booed at American events, are now uniting through sports, with over six million viewers watching the Blue Jays' Game 7. The team’s success, especially with players like George Springer and manager John Schneider expressing deep national pride, symbolizes a broader cultural shift in Canadian identity. Even the Calgary Flames and Sportsnet reflect the nationwide connection. As political tensions remain, the Blue Jays' playoff run has become a powerful symbol of Canadian unity, resilience, and sovereignty.",
