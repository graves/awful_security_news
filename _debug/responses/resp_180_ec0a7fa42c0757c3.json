  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eurostar has announced a major expansion plan to introduce double-decker high-speed trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time, ordering up to 50 'Celestia' trains from Alstom under a €2 billion deal. The first six trains are expected to enter service in 2031, with the goal of increasing passenger capacity from 19.5 million to 30 million annually. A significant €80 million investment will go into upgrading the Temple Mills depot in London, the only UK facility capable of handling such trains. While Eurostar's leadership, including CEO Gwendoline Cazenave, highlights the initiative as a step toward enhanced passenger comfort, the move faces criticism from rail experts like Pete Waterman, who argue that Britain’s 200-year-old rail infrastructure is not built to accommodate double-deckers due to tunnel and overhead line constraints. The Office of Rail and Road is currently reviewing access to Temple Mills for rival operators such as Evolyn, Virgin, and Gemini Trains/Uber, signaling growing competition in cross-Channel rail services.",
