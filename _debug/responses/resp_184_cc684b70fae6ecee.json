This move addresses U.S. vulnerability due to reliance on Chinese supplies, especially amid rising trade tensions, and boosts confidence in alternative supply chains, as demonstrated by market reactions such as a rise in Lynas Rare Earths shares. The agreement builds on long-standing efforts initiated during the Trump administration and marks a significant step in deepening U.S.-Australia collaboration in critical minerals.",
