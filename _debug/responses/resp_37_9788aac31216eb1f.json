  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Louvre Museum heist marks a significant shift in museum theft tactics, moving from the theft of culturally valuable paintings to the targeted extraction of raw materials like jewelry and coins. Thieves used industrial tools such as angle grinders and blowtorches to breach the museum during daylight hours, stealing nine Napoleonic jewels in just four minutes. This brazen act echoes the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden and reflects a broader trend of increasingly aggressive, force-based attacks. Experts, including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath, warn that such thefts threaten permanent loss of cultural heritage, as stolen gems are often dismantled and sold for their components. The heist has prompted national scrutiny in France, with Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticizing security failures, and French authorities suspecting a link between multiple recent heists in Paris and Limoges. Interpol has added the stolen artifacts to its database, signaling an international effort to combat the growing threat. The incident underscores a growing concern that museums — which balance public access with security — are becoming vulnerable to industrial, high-risk attacks by organized or copycat groups.",
