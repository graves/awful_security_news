Meanwhile, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is rallying Republicans to oppose Sliwa and position himself as a moderate alternative to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa has strongly rejected the pressure, criticizing Cuomo’s reliance on billionaire donors and asserting that he represents blue-collar voters. Trump has also dismissed Sliwa, mocking his cat-related image and political style. Despite accusations that Sliwa and Mamdani are coordinating, both candidates have dismissed such claims, emphasizing that New Yorkers should have the final say in who leads the city.",
