  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 in Handlova. Cintula shot at Fico five times, wounding him seriously, and claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, which he believed were harming Slovak freedom. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack was a terrorism charge due to its specific targeting of a political leader, despite Cintula’s argument that it was not an act of violence intended to kill. Fico, who has been in power since 2006, has faced criticism from the liberal opposition for undermining democratic standards and media freedom, while the opposition blames him for creating social unrest. Fico has forgiven Cintula, and Cintula has stated he will appeal the verdict, calling it unjust. The case has exposed deep societal divisions in Slovakia and sparked national debate over political violence, democracy, and the limits of political expression.",
