    "Antidepressants vary significantly in their physical side effects, such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations, with some drugs increasing risk of heart attack or stroke.",
    "The study analyzed 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients across 30 common antidepressants, revealing that no two drugs are the same in their physiological impact.",
    "SSRIs like citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine generally have fewer physical side effects, though fluoxetine was linked to weight loss and higher blood pressure.",
    "Personalized treatment based on individual health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol) can lead to better outcomes, with different drugs recommended for different patients.",
    "The UK currently prescribes 85% of antidepressants as just three SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine), a pattern the researchers say could be dramatically reduced with personalized prescribing.",
    "A free online tool is being developed to help doctors and patients choose antidepressants based on side effect profiles, but cultural shifts within the NHS are needed to implement these findings.",
    "Side effects observed in the first eight weeks may persist, though long-term data are still being studied, especially for patients with chronic depression.",
    "While no antidepressant is universally 'good' or 'bad,' the differences in physical effects are clinically relevant and should inform shared decision-making between patients and practitioners."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study led by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked antidepressants based on their physical side effects, revealing significant differences in how drugs affect weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol. The study analyzed data from over 58,000 patients across 30 commonly prescribed antidepressants and found that no two drugs are alike. While SSRIs like citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine generally have fewer side effects, some—like venlafaxine, amitriptyline, and paroxetine—pose risks for patients with pre-existing conditions. The research urges a shift from standardized prescribing to personalized treatment, with patients and doctors working together to select drugs that match individual health needs. The findings are expected to influence prescribing patterns in the UK, where 85% of antidepressant prescriptions currently go to just three SSRIs. A free online decision-making tool is being developed to support this shift, though widespread adoption will require cultural change within the NHS.",
