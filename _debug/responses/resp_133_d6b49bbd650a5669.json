  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College, an incident that went unprosecuted for over a decade. Keeler, who first reported it shortly after, faced years of legal and emotional struggle, with prosecutors reluctant to act. In 2019, Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you,' which reinvigorated her efforts. After a three-year search, Cleary was extradited from France in 2024, and on October 20, 2025, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison by Senior Judge Kevin Hess. The sentence, below state guidelines, was based on Cleary’s guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. The case exposes systemic failures in campus sexual assault justice, including evidence destruction, prosecutorial inaction, and delayed accountability, while also highlighting the enduring trauma of survivors like Keeler, who described the 12-year journey as surreal and painful.",
