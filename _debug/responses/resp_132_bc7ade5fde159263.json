    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of 17 known rare-earth elements, including five newly added metals: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium.",
    "The export controls include restrictions on specialized equipment used for refining rare-earth metals, which will impact foreign manufacturing capabilities.",
    "The restrictions are justified under national security grounds, citing dual-use applications of rare-earth materials in both civilian and military technologies.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, and sourcing 70% of its rare-earth compounds from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for critical technologies such as electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, AI semiconductors, fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and medical equipment.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "The new controls are seen as a strategic signaling move ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting during the APEC summit, aiming to strengthen China’s leverage in trade negotiations.",
    "While some emergency exports—such as those for public health or disaster relief—are exempt, most restrictions will significantly impact global supply chains and industrial production.",
    "Analysts suggest that the move deepens the US defence and technological vulnerability, widening capability gaps and undermining efforts to build domestic resilience.",
    "The US and China remain economically intertwined, and China’s actions show that even with export controls, supply chain interdependence persists."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, adding five new metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—to its existing list of seven, now restricting 12 out of 17 rare-earth elements. The restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce and set to take effect on December 1, 2025, apply to both the metals themselves and specialized refining equipment. The move is framed as a national security measure, citing risks of military applications and proliferation, and is strategically timed just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. The US, the world’s largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruptions to its defence and civilian technology sectors, including critical components in fighter jets, submarines, missiles, AI systems, and electric vehicles. Analysts interpret the restrictions as a deliberate signal to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations, highlighting the deep interdependence of the US and Chinese economies despite efforts to decouple.",
