  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article explores the use of profanity by prominent U.S. political figures, particularly President Donald Trump, who used the 'f-bomb' during a White House meeting with Ukraine’s leader in response to diplomatic tensions with Venezuela. Trump criticized Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro for offering preferential access to natural resources, calling it a betrayal of U.S. interests, and used vulgar language such as 'fuck around' and 'shit' to express frustration. This pattern is not unique to Trump: former President Joe Biden used similar profanity during a 2010 press conference and again on a hot mic, while Barack Obama and Dick Cheney also used offensive language in public settings. The article highlights that such language, though rare in formal political settings, is a recurring feature of political discourse, often tied to emotional reactions, policy disputes, or media attention. These instances raise broader questions about decorum, media ethics, and the role of language in political leadership, both domestically and internationally.",
