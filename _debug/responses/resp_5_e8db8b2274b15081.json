    "A 2019-style meeting is unlikely to occur again due to lack of current engagement, absence of a formal North Korean proposal, and lack of active communication channels.",
    "In 2019, the U.S. used a bullhorn at the DMZ to signal a meeting, and North Korea responded with a symbolic clean-up of the border area, indicating possible receptiveness.",
    "The Trump administration is currently prioritizing a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping due to escalating trade tensions, not a summit with North Korea."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Trump administration officials are quietly discussing a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s upcoming Asia trip, driven by Trump’s personal interest sparked by a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung. Despite Kim’s prior expressed openness and the precedent of a 2019 handshake summit at the Panmunjom border, there has been no active communication between the U.S. and North Korea in months, and no serious logistical planning has been undertaken. The White House has instead prioritized a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping due to escalating trade tensions. Officials note that a repeat of the 2019 summit—arranged after a tweet and involving a bullhorn message and DMZ meeting—is unlikely due to current lack of engagement, and South Korea has not initiated any talks with Pyongyang. While the idea remains open, no formal proposals or agreements have been made, and the feasibility remains highly speculative.",
