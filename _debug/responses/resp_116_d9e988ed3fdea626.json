  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays, after overcoming the Seattle Mariners in a hard-fought seven-game ALCS, have returned to the World Series for the first time since 1993. The Blue Jays' resurgence, marked by a 94-68 regular-season record and a 34-run offensive explosion in the ALDS, has made them a serious contender. However, they face the Los Angeles Dodgers, the reigning World Series champions with a record-setting $340 million payroll, two titles, and five pennants in the past nine years. The Dodgers' postseason dominance—sweeping both the Phillies and Brewers—was highlighted by Shohei Ohtani's historic Game 4 performance, including three home runs and a 6.1-inning shutout. While the Blue Jays are strong offensively, the Dodgers possess superior pitching and defense, though their bullpen has been a vulnerability. Game 1 of the World Series is set for Friday, October 24, in Toronto, marking the beginning of a high-stakes championship showdown.",
