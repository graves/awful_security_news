    "A former New York state prison guard, Robert Brooks, was killed after being beaten by correctional officers upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024.",
    "The incident, captured on silent body-camera footage, showed guards punching, stomping, and lifting Brooks by the neck, leading to severe injuries including damage to the spleen, liver, and groin, and ultimately fatal internal bleeding.",
    "David Kingsley was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter; Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges, though Kieffer and Galliher were charged with second-degree gang assault and Kieffer with filing a false instrument.",
    "Prosecutor William Fitzpatrick, appointed as a special prosecutor after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself, argued that all guards acted as a gang and showed 'depraved indifference to human life'.",
    "The case sparked public outrage due to the graphic, silent video footage revealing the guards' apparent indifference to Brooks' injuries.",
    "Six of the 10 guards indicted in February were charged with murder, with five previously pleading guilty to manslaughter and one to a misdemeanor charge of attempted tampering with evidence.",
    "Another guard is scheduled to go on trial in January for second-degree manslaughter, and three more have agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges and are cooperating with prosecutors.",
    "This case is part of a larger pattern of prison violence, as Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards involved in the March 1, 2025, beating and death of Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility."
