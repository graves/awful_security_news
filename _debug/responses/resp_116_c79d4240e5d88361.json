  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has responded to growing criticism from Hollywood studios, unions, and talent agencies by introducing new policies for its Sora 2 AI tool. The tool allows users to generate hyperrealistic videos and audio using text prompts, but has been misused to create fake, unauthorized content of real people—including Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, and Michael Jackson—leading to emotional and ethical backlash. The daughter of Robin Williams called such content 'horrible slop', and actors like Chaley Rose expressed concern about being exploited without consent. Talent agencies, including SAG-AFTRA, UTA, and CAA, have warned that AI platforms are exploiting performers’ likenesses and intellectual property, with some content infringing on copyrights (e.g., SpongeBob SquarePants). California’s 2024 consent law has inspired a proposed federal 'NO FAKES Act' to protect artists. OpenAI has now implemented an opt-in policy, blocking public generation of well-known characters and agreeing to remove existing unauthorized videos, including those of Martin Luther King Jr. The article highlights a critical shift in how AI technology is regulated, emphasizing the need for consent, control, and ethical responsibility in the creative industry.",
