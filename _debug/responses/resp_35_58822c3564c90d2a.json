  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was convicted of fraud and served a seven-year prison sentence, was released after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence. Santos dismissed criticism from fellow Republicans like Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino, maintaining that the prosecution was not political and that he has accepted significant personal accountability. He stated that he will not return to politics in the next decade and instead plans to focus on prison reform, emphasizing that solitary confinement creates recidivism. Despite claims of remorse, his former colleagues argue he showed no genuine repentance or restitution, and the commutation has reignited debate over political clemency and accountability in public office.",
