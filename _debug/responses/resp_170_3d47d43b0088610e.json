    "China has significantly tightened export controls on rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and expanding restrictions to 12 out of 17 rare-earth elements.",
    "The restrictions include export controls on specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, effective from December 1, 2025.",
    "Foreign companies must obtain special approvals from Beijing and explain the intended use of products containing rare-earth metals, especially those with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content.",
    "China justified the controls under national security grounds, citing dual-use applications and evidence of sensitive transfers to military or hostile actors.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for critical technologies including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, AI semiconductors, and defence systems like F-35 jets and missiles.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, sourcing 70% of its rare-earth compounds from China between 2020 and 2023, making it highly vulnerable to supply disruptions.",
    "China’s actions are interpreted as a strategic signal ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit, aiming to strengthen its negotiating leverage in ongoing trade talks.",
    "The move reflects China’s dominant role in global rare-earth supply—producing at least 60% and processing 90% of the world’s supply—allowing it to exert significant influence over global supply chains.",
    "Experts note that while China may face economic costs due to supply chain interdependence, the move signals its intent to weaponize its supply chain position.",
    "Certain exports for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief remain exempt from the restrictions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), effective from December 1, 2025. The restrictions apply to both rare-earth metals and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals and disclose intended uses. China cites national security and dual-use risks—particularly sensitive transfers to military actors—as justification. The move comes just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting it is a strategic signaling effort to strengthen China’s negotiating leverage. The United States, which imports 70% of its rare-earth compounds from China, faces significant disruptions in defence and civilian technologies such as electric vehicles, AI systems, and medical devices. Analysts from CSIS and the University of Montana interpret this as a calculated move to exploit China’s dominant position in the rare-earth supply chain, potentially widening the technological and industrial gap between the two powers. Exports for emergency medical and disaster relief remain exempt.",
