Santos began serving a sentence in July 2024, but was released immediately on October 18, 2025, following Trump’s commutation announcement on Truth Social. The move follows a pattern of Trump’s executive use of pardons and commutations, including blanket pardons of over 1,500 individuals involved in Jan. 6-related charges and a previous pardon of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Trump compared Santos' crimes to those of Senator Richard Blumenthal, arguing that Santos' actions were more serious and emphasizing his political loyalty. Santos was the first member of Congress expelled without a criminal conviction, underscoring the growing emphasis on integrity and accountability in legislative service.",
