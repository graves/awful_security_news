  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil’s Amazon through its supply chain. Cattle from illegally deforested areas in Pará—such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa sustainable development area—are reportedly transported through a 'laundering' system using group-level animal transit permits (GTAs), which fail to track individual animals and thus cannot verify origins. The Brazilian state agency Adepará has authorized these movements despite environmental violations, and JBS has not implemented a verifiable traceability system for its indirect suppliers, despite past promises under the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement. Experts and advocacy groups argue that voluntary corporate commitments are insufficient and that the federal government must enforce a transparent, publicly accessible traceability system to prevent illegal land use and protect Indigenous communities. With deforestation in Pará increasing by 421% in 2024 and key climate events like COP30 approaching, the article underscores the urgent need for systemic reform in global supply chains to address deforestation and hold corporations accountable.",
