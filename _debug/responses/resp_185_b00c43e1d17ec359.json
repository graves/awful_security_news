  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article explores how India's Diwali and Dhanteras gold-buying season is being shaped by soaring gold prices, with consumers facing pressure due to price hikes of up to 60% for gold and 70% for silver. Despite high costs, demand remains strong due to deep-rooted cultural beliefs in gold's auspiciousness and wealth-generating properties. Retailers are responding by designing lighter, more affordable gold jewellery to meet budget constraints, especially among younger buyers. A significant shift is occurring in demand—investment in gold bars, coins, and ETFs is rising sharply, with investment demand increasing from 19% to 35% in India's gold market between Q2 2023 and Q2 2025. The Reserve Bank of India is also increasing its gold holdings to diversify reserves and reduce dollar dependence. While affluent households continue to purchase, lower-income families are being priced out and delaying purchases. Experts note that India's massive gold holdings—equivalent to 88.8% of GDP—provide long-term financial resilience, ensuring that demand for gold is unlikely to collapse even amid short-term economic headwinds.",
