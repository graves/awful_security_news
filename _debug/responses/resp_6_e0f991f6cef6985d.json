  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been effectively stalled, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for a meeting. This shift follows a previous assertion that a summit would occur within two weeks after a phone call between the two leaders. Diplomatic engagement between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, once seen as a necessary step, has also been downgraded due to divergent views on ending the Ukraine war and Lavrov’s limited influence in Russian decision-making. The Kremlin maintains that a summit cannot be postponed without a prior date, and Russia has rejected proposals to freeze the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia’s reduced interest in diplomacy stems from the U.S. withholding long-range missile support, suggesting that Ukrainian military capabilities are critical to peace negotiations. Despite these setbacks, the possibility of a Rubio-Lavrov meeting at a future ASEAN summit in Malaysia remains open, signaling continued diplomatic fluidity.",
