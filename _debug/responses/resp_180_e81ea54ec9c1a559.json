  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali, Delhi faced a severe air pollution crisis, with the Air Quality Index reaching 360—classified as 'severe'—due to widespread use of traditional firecrackers despite a court directive to use only 'green' crackers. The Supreme Court had relaxed the ban on crackers, allowing limited use during specific hours, but enforcement was weak, and fireworks were lit well past midnight. Contributing factors include low wind speeds, stubble burning in neighboring states, and year-round pollution from vehicles and dust. The Graded Response Action Plan was activated to restrict diesel generators and wood burning. Residents reported poor visibility, taste of ash, and respiratory distress, highlighting both the immediate health dangers and a growing concern over public awareness and policy enforcement regarding air pollution.",
