  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man, to five years to life in prison after convicting him of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi, who used aliases such as Arthur Knight and falsely claimed to be dead in 2020, was identified through a decade-old DNA match from a rape kit backlog. He was arrested in Scotland in 2023 due to distinctive tattoos linked to an Interpol notice and extradited to Utah in January 2024. Despite claiming innocence and using false identities to evade justice, he was convicted in both a 2023 and a 2024 trial, with the first conviction leading to a prison sentence. The case highlights the dangers of predatory abusers using deception, aliases, and fake deaths to avoid accountability, and underscores the importance of addressing sexual assault backlogs and using DNA evidence to identify fugitives.",
