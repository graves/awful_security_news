  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, by altering both their social behaviors and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants, especially nurses, increase distance from foragers—demonstrating proactive social distancing. When exposed to the fungus, the ants build nests that are more compartmentalized, with reduced connectivity, greater spacing between entrances, and longer travel routes, which slows disease transmission. These structural changes complement social behaviors, creating a robust defense system known as 'architectural immunity.' The research, conducted by Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, is the first demonstration of non-human social species actively modifying their environment in response to disease threats. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest that these principles could inform human architectural design to reduce disease spread in public spaces, offering a nature-based approach to pandemic preparedness.",
