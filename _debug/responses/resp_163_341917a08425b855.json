  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically insufficient, with only 750 metric tonnes of aid entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two Israeli-controlled border crossings being operational. The WFP has expanded distribution points to 26, but still falls short of the 145 planned. Humanitarian access is severely restricted, including the denial of access to the Salah al-Din Street, and aid to the northern regions remains minimal. While Hamas has committed to returning the bodies of 28 captives, only 13 have been delivered, with two more reported exhumed on 2025-10-21. The ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump is seen as vital for sustaining aid, and residents are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict or supply disruption.",
