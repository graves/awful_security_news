  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A recent jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum in October 2025, in which thieves stole high-value items including the crown of Empress Eugénie, highlights longstanding security vulnerabilities. The crown was found damaged outside the museum, and the heist—completed in just seven minutes—follows a history of thefts, such as the 1911 'Mona Lisa' heist and the 1983 disappearance of 16th-century armor. A Court of Auditors report from 2019 to 2024 revealed persistent delays in upgrading security systems, with outdated technology and poor operational implementation. The Louvre has also faced chronic problems including overcrowding, water leaks, temperature fluctuations, and inadequate facilities, prompting a 2025 memo from its president, Laurence des Cars, calling for urgent intervention. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to give the 'Mona Lisa' its own dedicated room as part of a 10-year renovation. The museum continues to face pressure from high visitor numbers—8.7 million in 2024—leading to staff strikes and visitor fatigue, reinforcing the need for systemic reform.",
