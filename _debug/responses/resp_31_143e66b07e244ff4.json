    "A Slovak court found Juraj Cintula guilty of terrorism in an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, shot at Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter during a public greeting.",
    "Fico survived with serious injuries, including to the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot, and made a public appearance months after the incident.",
    "The court rejected a lesser charge of murder or attack, citing Cintula’s intent to target the prime minister specifically, thus qualifying the act as terrorism.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and stated the attack was a ‘scream against fear’ paralyzing society.",
    "The verdict was controversial, with Cintula’s defense arguing that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism, while Fico’s legal team described Cintula as a terrorist who promoted violent political solutions.",
    "The case exposed deep societal divisions between Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition, fueling political polarization.",
    "Fico has forgiven Cintula, despite the severity of the attack and ongoing health issues.",
    "The sentence of 21 years is less than the maximum of life in prison, reflecting judicial discretion in sentencing political terrorism.",
    "The case has become a symbol of the tensions between democracy, political extremism, and public safety in Slovakia."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for terrorism charges following an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024, during which Fico was shot five times in Handlova. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that Cintula specifically targeted the prime minister, fulfilling the criteria for terrorism, despite his claim that he wanted to stop Fico’s policies damaging Slovak culture and freedom. The verdict, delivered on October 21, 2025, reflects deep societal and political divisions between Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition. Cintula has stated he will appeal the decision, calling it unjust, while Fico, who has forgone retaliation, continues to lead the government, though with ongoing health issues. The case underscores broader tensions in Slovak democracy, including media freedom, political extremism, and public safety.",
