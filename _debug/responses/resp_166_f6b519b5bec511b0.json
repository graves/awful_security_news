  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, via SUPARCO from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025. The satellite, equipped with hyperspectral imaging technology, enables detailed Earth observation for precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning. The launch marks a major advancement in Pakistan’s space program and strengthens its strategic cooperation with China, particularly in the context of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While the satellite will take about two months to calibrate before full operation, it is expected to significantly enhance national capabilities in managing natural resources, improving agricultural productivity, and detecting geohazard risks. This milestone is part of Pakistan’s broader push to expand its space capabilities, which includes the successful deployment of two other operational satellites, EO-1 and KS-1, in 2025.",
