  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. The investigation highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the absence of individual animal tracking, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through transit permits (GTAs) that only record group-level data. These permits, issued by state agency Adepará, enabled cattle to move into protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where land grabs and violence against Indigenous communities have occurred. Despite JBS’s 2024 acknowledgment of traceability gaps and a 2026 deadline for supplier declarations, Human Rights Watch and environmental groups argue that voluntary commitments are insufficient. The report underscores the urgent need for mandatory, publicly accessible traceability systems across Brazil, especially as the country prepares for the COP30 climate summit in Pará. Without such reforms, companies like JBS will continue to profit from supply chains that contribute to Amazon deforestation and the displacement of vulnerable communities.",
