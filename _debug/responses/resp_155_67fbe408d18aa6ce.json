  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The fragile United States-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is under direct threat as Israel launches multiple air strikes on southern and central Gaza, claiming Hamas fighters attacked its troops in Rafah. The Israeli military reports two soldier deaths and temporary halting of humanitarian aid, while Palestinian sources report over 97 deaths and 230 injuries since the ceasefire began on October 10. Hamas denies any attacks in Rafah, citing Israeli control and severed contact, and accuses Israel of supporting armed groups in Israeli zones. The US alleges imminent Hamas violations, which Hamas rejects as propaganda. Amid rising tensions, Israeli far-right officials call for full combat resumption, while analysts stress the ceasefire's fragility. Meanwhile, Hamas seeks to implement the ceasefire through diplomatic channels in Cairo, and ongoing struggles over the recovery of captives’ remains highlight deep humanitarian and political divisions.",
