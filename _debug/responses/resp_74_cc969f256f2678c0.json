  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In early 2025, Donald Trump’s response to mass 'No Kings' protests — including AI-generated memes mocking protesters as supplicants in a royal court — is interpreted as evidence of growing authoritarian tendencies. The president and Vice President JD Vance used satire to reinforce a narrative of unchecked power, while actions like pardoning George Santos and authorizing military strikes in the Caribbean and covert operations in Venezuela are criticized as unconstitutional and politically motivated. Protesters from across 50 states, totaling over 7 million, expressed concern about democratic erosion, with many citing personal fears of authoritarianism. The White House dismissed the protests as insignificant or composed of extremists, showing contempt for dissent. Analysts argue that Trump’s behavior, including legal overreach and foreign policy overreach, validates the protesters’ claim that the U.S. is moving toward autocracy, and that such actions threaten the rule of law, democratic participation, and constitutional governance.",
