  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warns that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies as open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025. Without these subsidies, health insurance premiums could skyrocket—by up to $2,000 per month—making coverage unaffordable for over 20 million Americans, particularly those earning below $63,000 annually. Jeffries opposes a Republican proposal for a one-year extension, arguing it is politically motivated and fails to address the broader crisis of affordability and access. He highlights that Republican policies, such as cutting Medicaid and offering permanent tax breaks to billionaires, have already harmed health access for 14 million people. Jeffries also criticizes Republican efforts to pay only select federal workers, calling them 'lawless' and 'piecemeal,' and insists that a full, comprehensive reopening of the government is essential. As public awareness grows during the open enrollment period, he believes the nation will come to understand the urgency of stabilizing health care access for working-class families.",
