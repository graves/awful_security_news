This caused a cascade failure affecting 113 AWS services, including major apps such as Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, Starbucks, banks, financial services, media outlets, and smart home devices like Ring and Alexa. Experts attribute the failure to human error rather than a cyberattack, and AWS confirmed it had fully resolved the issue, though some users faced delays in message processing. The incident underscores the critical dependence of modern digital life—ranging from finance and communication to entertainment and smart devices—on centralized cloud infrastructure, with AWS remaining the dominant provider despite the risks of systemic failure.",
