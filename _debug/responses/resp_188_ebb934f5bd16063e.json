During his 84-day incarceration at FCI Fairton, Santos described poor prison conditions, including mold, broken air conditioning, and substandard construction, calling the system 'broken' and 'dehumanizing'. Now free, Santos has declared a new mission: prison reform, stating he is no longer interested in politics and is dedicated to improving the prison system. He has communicated with President Trump about this mission and has published reflections on The South Shore Press.
