  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro has sparked widespread anxiety among Colombians, who fear economic consequences such as job losses, business bankruptcies, and disruptions to travel and trade due to Trump’s threats to cut subsidies and raise tariffs. The US is Colombia’s largest trading partner, with 30% of Colombian exports directed to the US, including key goods like coffee, flowers, and gold. The conflict stems from Trump’s accusations that Petro promotes drug production, which Petro denies, calling the claims 'rude and ignorant'. Previous confrontations, including Petro’s call for criminal proceedings over US strikes on drug-smuggling boats and his pro-Palestinian remarks, have led to the revocation of his US visa. Citizens across Colombia express concern that the conflict harms ordinary lives, emphasizing that real solutions to drug trafficking must be found, not political insults. This situation highlights the vulnerability of developing nations to geopolitical tensions and the importance of diplomatic dialogue in maintaining economic stability.",
