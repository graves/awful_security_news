  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New tariffs imposed by the US government on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, wooden furniture, steel, and copper are raising construction and renovation costs, placing significant financial pressure on home buyers, builders, and manufacturers. Individuals like Anthony Cabrera have seen their home budgets balloon from $300,000 to $450,000 due to price increases, while companies such as RH and IKEA face financial strain and potential price hikes. Experts including Peter Harrell, Buddy Hughes, and Matthew Walsh warn that the already weak housing market is further weakened by these input costs, especially as tariffs are expected to continue ramping up in January. Consumers will bear up to 55% of the cost, with inflationary effects passed through to end users. Even businesses with limited direct exposure, like Colony and Stillfried Design, are seeing reduced sales and higher material costs due to uncertainty and rising prices. Experts conclude that while the tariffs are not a complete collapse of the housing market, they represent a cumulative and damaging burden that undermines affordability and long-term housing development.",
