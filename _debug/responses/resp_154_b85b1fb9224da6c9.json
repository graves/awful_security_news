  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, citing growing tensions over Gaza operations and the handling of the October 7 Hamas attack. Hanegbi, who had advocated for a partial deal with Hamas and opposed a full military takeover of Gaza City, admitted personal responsibility for the security failures and called for a thorough investigation, which Netanyahu’s government has not yet established. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accused Netanyahu of replacing dissenting voices with loyalists. In response, Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, has been appointed as acting head, signaling a shift toward a more centralized and compliant security apparatus.",
