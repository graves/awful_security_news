  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by Portugal’s Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable in the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator CARRIS and was not certified for passenger use. The cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, causing one car to derail and crash into a building, killing at least 16 people and injuring several others. Eyewitnesses described the event as chaotic, with one man named Bruno recounting a sudden, violent crash and smoke. The investigation also revealed serious maintenance failures, including false completion of tasks and a misleadingly compliant maintenance plan. Although the findings are preliminary and not conclusive, the report raises significant concerns about safety protocols, oversight, and compliance in public transportation infrastructure, especially in historic urban areas like Lisbon.",
