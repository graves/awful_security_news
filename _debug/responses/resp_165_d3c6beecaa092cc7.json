  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food deliveries to Gaza remain critically insufficient, with only 750 metric tonnes entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to just two open crossings: Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite a US-brokered ceasefire and efforts to expand aid, humanitarian access is severely restricted, including the closure of the Rafah crossing and the lack of access to key routes like Salah al-Din Street. The WFP now operates 26 distribution points, still far below the 145 it needs. Aid has reached northern Gaza in limited forms, but residents are rationing food out of fear of renewed conflict. The situation highlights the urgent need for more open crossings and political progress on returning captives' remains to ensure sustained humanitarian relief.",
