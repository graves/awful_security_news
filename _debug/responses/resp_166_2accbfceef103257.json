    "The US and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement allowing the transfer of asylum seekers to Belize, as part of a broader strategy to limit US asylum applications and increase deportations.",
    "The agreement is controversial due to concerns about human rights, including potential abuse in countries like South Sudan and Eswatini, and whether Belize can truly ensure the safety and rights of asylum seekers.",
    "Belize claims it has safeguards, including a veto power, nationality restrictions, transfer caps, and security screenings to prevent threats to public safety or national security.",
    "Critics, including opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton, argue Belize's asylum system is underfunded, understaffed, and incapable of handling such transfers, calling the deal a 'dumping ground' for asylum seekers.",
    "The agreement requires Senate approval in Belize and may face legal, political, and ethical challenges, especially given prior cases where deportees were returned to their home countries (e.g., Jamaica, Honduras).",
    "The deal reflects a broader trend in which the US has pursued 'safe third country' arrangements with countries like Mexico, Rwanda, Uganda, and Guatemala, often under scrutiny for compliance with international humanitarian law.",
    "Historical precedents, such as Venezuela’s reversal on accepting deportees and the return of Honduran individuals to Honduras, show inconsistencies in the feasibility and effectiveness of such agreements.",
    "The Trump administration argues that third-country transfers are necessary when home countries refuse to accept deportees, but critics point out that in practice, individuals are often returned, undermining the policy's legitimacy."
