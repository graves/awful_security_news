While the Palace has banned him from major royal events like the Christmas celebrations at Sandringham and the Order of the Garter, with a potential return only in April 2026, he continues to live at Royal Lodge.

Prince Andrew has shown no remorse or contrition, maintaining a defiant tone in his public statements. The move reflects both a desire to end damaging headlines and genuine concern over undisclosed contact with Epstein, but it has not eliminated the possibility of further revelations or political pressure, especially in the United States.",
