  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a disgraced former U.S. Representative from New York, who was expelled from the House in 2023 after pleading guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos had falsely claimed aspects of his education, employment, and background, leading to widespread public and political scrutiny. Trump released Santos immediately from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J., citing the need to address 'rogue' figures in politics and drawing a comparison to Senator Richard Blumenthal’s past military service misstatement. This action reflects a broader pattern of executive pardons, including those issued for Jan. 6 Capitol-related offenses and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, reinforcing concerns about political accountability and executive discretion.",
