  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to the failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This marks the first such shutdown in years, following a historic 35-day partial shutdown in December 2018 that cost the economy an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected about 800,000 federal employees, with 300,000 furloughed. The current situation is complicated by deepening political divisions, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson leading a narrow House majority and lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. Since 1990, there have been only six government shutdowns, but partisan gridlock continues to prevent timely legislative action, highlighting a broader systemic challenge in U.S. governance.",
