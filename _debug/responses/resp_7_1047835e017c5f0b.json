  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A significant rise in car loan delinquency among subprime borrowers — those with credit scores below 670 — has emerged in the United States, with the delinquency rate doubling since 2021 to reach 6.43%, the second-highest level since the early 1990s. This marks a worsening trend compared to past recessions, including the Great Recession and the pandemic. The surge is driven by record car prices, high interest rates, rising repair and insurance costs, and the resumption of student loan payments after pandemic pauses. Lenders are now actively using GPS tracking and ignition disabling to repossess vehicles, signaling a level of economic distress similar to the Great Recession. The stark contrast between subprime and prime borrowers highlights the 'K-shaped economy,' where wealthier individuals thrive while lower-income consumers face financial collapse. This growing crisis reveals a deeper structural issue: widespread economic hardship beneath the surface of overall economic growth and stock market performance.",
