  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 disrupted key UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns about over-reliance on a small number of US tech firms—particularly Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Despite the cost and scalability benefits of using these giants, experts warn of systemic risks due to 'nested dependencies' and market concentration. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has identified market imbalances and recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to enforce competition. Experts and policymakers now advocate for greater diversification, national resilience, and mandatory data resilience standards requiring use of multiple cloud providers. The article underscores a growing political and technical call for a more sovereign, open, and competitive cloud ecosystem in the UK and beyond.",
