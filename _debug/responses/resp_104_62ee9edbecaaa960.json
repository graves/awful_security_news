    "Tech CEOs such as Dario Amodei (Anthropic), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have made bold claims about AI writing a significant portion of code, suggesting a potential new era of automation in software development.",
    "Despite optimistic rhetoric, software engineers like Colton Voege and Simon Willison report mixed or negative outcomes, indicating that AI tools often fail to deliver long-term productivity gains or may generate flawed, hard-to-maintain code.",
    "AI tools are most effective for low-complexity, repetitive tasks (e.g., prototyping), but are less effective in solving high-level engineering problems requiring human judgment, creativity, and problem-solving.",
    "Studies show conflicting results: a METR study found LLM users took 19% longer to complete tasks, while a Danish survey reported a modest 6.5% time saving — suggesting AI's real-world impact is nuanced and context-dependent.",
    "The term 'workslop' is coined to describe overuse of AI tools in inappropriate contexts, leading to messy, unreviewable code and increased team burden.",
    "AI tool use is often mandated or encouraged by management, even when not justified, creating a culture of compliance over critical evaluation.",
    "Concerns exist about AI replacing junior software engineers, disrupting long-term talent development, and the environmental cost of training large language models.",
    "Experts like Boris Cherny (Anthropic) and Simon Willison emphasize that every line of AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human engineer, reinforcing the idea that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human oversight."

However, software engineers report mixed and often negative experiences, with AI generating flawed or unreviewable code, failing to deliver long-term productivity gains, and sometimes creating 'workslop' scenarios where overuse leads to inefficiencies. While AI is effective for simple, repetitive tasks like prototyping, experts stress that human oversight is essential for high-level problem solving and system design. Studies show conflicting results—some report modest time savings, others show significant delays—highlighting the complexity of real-world impact. Concerns about job displacement, environmental costs, and mandatory AI use despite lack of justification further underscore that AI remains a tool, not a replacement for human engineers.",
