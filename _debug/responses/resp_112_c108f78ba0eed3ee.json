  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asserts that public pressure will force Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025, because without them, health insurance premiums could surge by up to $2,000 per month, making coverage unaffordable for over 20 million Americans. Jeffries criticizes Republican proposals—such as those from Rep. Mike Lawler and Sen. Ron Johnson—for being inadequate, politically inconsistent, and aligned with billionaire tax breaks rather than working-class health security. He highlights that the average ACA recipient earns around $63,000 annually, and premium hikes could push costs to over $24,000 per year, leading to mass insurance dropouts. Jeffries also opposes Republican plans to pay furloughed federal workers, calling them 'lawless' and 'piecemeal,' emphasizing that the shutdown has become a political tactic to delay action. As open enrollment nears, Jeffries argues that public awareness and economic reality will compel Congress to act decisively.",
