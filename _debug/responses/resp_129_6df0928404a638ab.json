  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once on the brink of extinction due to whaling and ongoing threats like ship strikes and fishing gear, has shown a positive trend with an estimated increase from 376 to 384 individuals in 2025—up 8 whales and over 7% from 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute this growth to improved conservation measures, including new management in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence and reduced injury rates. While only 11 calves were born, four mothers produced calves and some showed shorter birth intervals, indicating improved reproductive health. Despite these signs of recovery, experts remain cautious due to persistent threats from ocean warming and human activities. Environmental groups warn that weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and NOAA’s science-based protections could reverse progress, emphasizing the need for sustained political and scientific support.",
