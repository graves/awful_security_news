  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli forces killed 11 members of a Palestinian family in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood, marking the deadliest breach of the ceasefire that began eight days prior. The attack, involving a tank shell fired at a civilian vehicle carrying children and women, violates the so-called yellow line demarcation and underscores ongoing civilian targeting. Hamas condemned the incident as a massacre and called on U.S. President Donald Trump and mediators to pressure Israel to respect the ceasefire. Despite the agreement, Israel continues to block key border crossings like Rafah, restrict aid deliveries, and deny access to heavy machinery and international experts needed to recover buried bodies. Humanitarian agencies report severe shortages, with 49% of Gazans receiving less than six litres of drinking water daily and only 560 tonnes of food delivered daily—far below what is needed. The situation highlights a deepening humanitarian and political crisis, with both sides failing to uphold ceasefire terms, and civilians facing extreme risks and suffering.",
