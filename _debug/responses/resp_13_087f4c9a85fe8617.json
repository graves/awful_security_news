Both men were from Kibbutz Nir Oz, with Zalmanovich, aged 85, believed to have been killed in captivity in November 2023, and Adar, aged 38, having died in defense of the community. The return of their remains is part of a US-proposed ceasefire agreement signed on October 9, 2025, which required Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours. The Israeli government and families expressed deep sorrow over the loss. US Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the difficulty of recovering bodies buried under rubble or lost in conflict zones, noting that while progress has been made, the process is not going to happen overnight. The article highlights both the human cost and the ongoing challenges of recovering human remains in a war zone, as well as the political and humanitarian dimensions of the ceasefire effort.",
