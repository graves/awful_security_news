  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, has publicly emphasized that the 2020 Brexit deal caused long-term economic damage, citing a 4% decline in productivity according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). This marks a significant shift in Labour’s policy stance, moving from reluctance to actively highlighting Brexit’s economic costs, especially in high-level international forums such as the IMF and G7. The UK government is now framing this decline as a key justification for future fiscal measures, including tax increases of £40bn annually, expected to be detailed in the upcoming Budget on 26 November. The 'Brexit reset' negotiations aim to improve trade ties by scrapping post-Brexit checks on food and farm trade and enabling UK manufacturers to bid for European defence contracts. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have taken a contrasting position, pledging £47bn in annual spending cuts if they win the next election, highlighting a clear policy divide. The discussion reflects both domestic political dynamics and global economic concern about Brexit’s long-term consequences.",
