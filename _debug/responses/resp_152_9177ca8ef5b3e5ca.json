  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that early circumcision is linked to autism, citing a 2013 and 2015 study, and a 2025 unpeer-reviewed preprint from WPLab. Experts reject these claims, noting both studies show only weak correlations and lack evidence of causation or data on acetaminophen use. The 2013 study was exploratory and not designed to prove a link; the 2015 Danish study had a very small sample size and did not examine drug use. The WPLab paper, which Kennedy cited, is a preprint with no peer review and makes unsupported causal claims. Decades of research show acetaminophen is safe for infants when used properly, and no scientific evidence links it to increased autism risk. Experts stress that correlation does not imply causation and that cultural and demographic variables were not accounted for in the studies.",
