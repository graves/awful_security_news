    "Patients and doctors believe a $150 price point could be transformative, improving access and patient outcomes, but warn it remains uncertain and not yet realized.",
    "The proposal is linked to the 'Most Favored Nation' executive order, which aims to align US drug pricing with lower international prices.",
    "Medical experts, including Dr. William Feldman and Dr. Jody Dushay, note that while $150 would be a major step toward affordability, it may not fully resolve financial barriers, especially for low-income patients.",
    "Compounded GLP-1 drugs, while cheaper, are considered risky due to lack of regulation and potential safety concerns.",
    "The article highlights real-world patient experiences, such as Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell, who have lost over 260 pounds collectively and are actively seeking affordable access to the drugs."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump suggested during an Oval Office news conference that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic could be priced at $150 per month, referencing a cost disparity between the US and Europe. While the idea was initially met with excitement by patients and doctors who have struggled with high drug costs—many paying $500 or more out of pocket—Dr. Mehmet Oz, the CMS administrator, immediately clarified it was not a done deal, emphasizing that negotiations were ongoing. The announcement triggered significant stock drops for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, reflecting investor concerns about potential price reductions. Experts note that while $150 would be a major step toward affordability and could dramatically increase patient access, especially for those without insurance, it remains speculative and unconfirmed. Compounded versions of the drugs, though cheaper, are considered risky due to lack of regulation. The proposal is tied to the administration’s 'Most Favored Nation' executive order, which aims to align US drug pricing with lower international prices. Real-world patient experiences, such as those of Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell, highlight the urgent need for affordable access and the possibility of switching to branded drugs if prices fall. Despite cautious optimism, medical professionals stress that affordability and safety must be balanced, and more details are needed before considering the $150 goal a realistic outcome.",
