  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukraine has launched a successful strike using UK-made Storm Shadow missiles against the Russian Bryansk Chemical Plant, a key facility producing explosives and rocket fuel used in attacks on Ukraine. The Ukrainian military claims the strike penetrated Russian air defenses and targets a core part of Russia’s military-industrial complex. This action follows Western commitments to pressure Russia’s economy and defense industry, particularly after a meeting involving U.S. President Donald Trump, who signaled reluctance to supply Tomahawk cruise missiles and called off planned talks with Vladimir Putin. Russia responded with an overnight air attack on Kyiv, demonstrating ongoing escalation. The conflict, which began in February 2022, has led to significant territorial control by Russia, including Crimea, and continues to be shaped by military innovation, diplomatic shifts, and international alliances.",
