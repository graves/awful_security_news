  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has been able to afford his residence at Royal Lodge through a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate, where he made substantial upfront payments—around £8 million—covering renovations and effectively buying out future rent obligations. This arrangement, which includes strict maintenance and inspection clauses, eliminates ongoing monthly rent and allows him to live in the property without commercial rent payments. However, the deal has drawn renewed public and political scrutiny due to ongoing allegations of ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and concerns that taxpayer money is being used to fund a non-working royal’s lifestyle. The National Audit Office confirmed the arrangement met 'value for money' standards, but critics argue it lacks transparency and fiscal responsibility. Prince Andrew’s lease ends in 2078, with successors including his ex-wife and daughters, and financial returns for early departure have tapered to just £186,000 per year by 2028. Political figures including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick have called for Prince Andrew to live privately and pay his fair share, emphasizing accountability and public trust in royal finances.",
