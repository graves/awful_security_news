    "Vice President JD Vance, a former Marine, celebrated the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in California, featuring a large-scale live-fire demonstration involving fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels, and a towed howitzer.",
    "The demonstration sparked backlash from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who closed a section of Interstate 5 due to safety concerns, calling the live fire over a busy highway 'dangerous' and 'wrong'.",
