  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A voter in Terrebonne, Quebec, reported that her mail-in ballot was not counted due to an incorrect postal code printed on the return envelope by Elections Canada. This error, which affected dozens of ballots, led to a one-vote margin in favor of Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste over Bloc Québécois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné. The close race triggered a judicial recount, and now the case is being reviewed in Quebec’s Superior Court, with legal arguments centering on whether the result should be upheld or overturned. The case raises significant concerns about the reliability of election administration and public trust in democratic processes, especially when a single vote could alter the outcome of a seat. Critics argue that overturning the result undermines voter confidence, while others contend that maintaining the result denies the validity of the uncounted vote.",
