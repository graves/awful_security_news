    "Paz’s coalition won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition (43 seats in lower house, 12 in Senate), meaning he lacks a legislative majority and must form alliances to govern.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election in October 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of left-wing rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. The election was driven by Bolivia’s worsening economic crisis, including falling natural gas exports, soaring inflation, and fuel shortages, which eroded public trust in MAS. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote but lacks a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building to govern. His platform emphasizes private-sector-led growth while preserving social programs, and he pledged to secure fuel supplies through deferred payments and phase out universal subsidies. Both candidates, including Paz, committed to improving diplomatic relations with the United States, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the election a transformative opportunity. Paz’s campaign was strengthened by his populist running mate Edman Lara, known for anti-corruption TikTok content. However, the new government faces challenges, including opposition from Bolivia’s main labor union, the COB, which warns of protests against any threats to social gains. The election signals a major political and economic turning point for Bolivia, shifting toward a more moderate, market-oriented future.",
