  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating within protected areas in Pará state. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the absence of individual animal tracking, relying instead on group-level permits (GTAs) that obscure origins. Cattle from deforested protected zones—such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa area—are allegedly laundered through a transport system that hides their illegal origins. Despite past commitments like the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement, JBS has failed to implement full traceability, and its 2024 SEC filing acknowledges the inability to verify cattle origins. The article underscores that Pará has seen a 421% rise in deforestation in 2024 alone and is a hotspot for land grabs and violence against Indigenous communities. While Brazil’s federal and state governments have introduced traceability plans by 2026 and 2032, experts say these timelines are too slow and that mandatory, publicly accessible tracking systems are urgently needed to hold companies accountable and stop deforestation.",
