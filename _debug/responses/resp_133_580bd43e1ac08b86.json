Facing high inflation (23% in September), dwindling U.S. dollar reserves, and fuel shortages, Paz has committed to cutting wasteful subsidies, targeting fuel assistance to poorer families through direct cash transfers, and securing fuel imports from the U.S. and other countries. He also pledged to reform the judiciary and revise Bolivia’s constitution, raising concerns among Indigenous populations who benefited from Morales-era reforms.
