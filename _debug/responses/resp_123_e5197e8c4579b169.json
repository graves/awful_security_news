  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun serving a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya, marking the first time a former French head of state has been imprisoned. The conviction stems from allegations that Sarkozy, then interior minister and presidential candidate, used his official position to channel Libyan funds — from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi — into his campaign. The court ruled that he should serve time immediately due to the severity of the public order disruption. Sarkozy is being held in solitary confinement at Paris’s La Santé prison, with limited family contact and outdoor time. His legal team challenges both the conviction and the incarceration, calling it a political scandal and a serious injustice. The case has triggered widespread public support, with supporters gathering outside his home and criticizing the justice system. The incident has also raised alarms about judicial independence, particularly as current President Emmanuel Macron has engaged with Sarkozy, and France’s top magistrate has warned that such political involvement could undermine the impartiality of the judiciary.",
