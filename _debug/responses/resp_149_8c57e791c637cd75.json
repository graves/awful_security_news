    "The PVV's rise is linked to anti-immigration sentiment and a recent political rift over immigration policy, which has intensified public debate and made the role of AI in political discourse more critical."

The authority urges both citizens and AI developers to avoid relying on such tools, emphasizing the lack of transparency and verifiability in AI-generated political recommendations.
