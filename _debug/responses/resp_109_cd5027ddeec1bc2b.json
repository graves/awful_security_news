  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign a proposed compact aligned with Trump administration political priorities looms, nine institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth College—have signaled dissent. The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education demands policies such as banning transgender students from restrooms and sports, freezing tuition, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized testing for admissions. These conditions have been widely criticized by academic leaders, with MIT, Brown, Penn, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth rejecting the agreement on grounds that it undermines academic freedom, research integrity, and merit-based funding. The White House held a virtual meeting with several schools, including UVA and Dartmouth, to negotiate the Compact, but the resulting rejections indicate strong resistance to politically driven mandates. With six out of nine institutions declining to sign, the initiative is facing significant institutional pushback, raising concerns about the politicization of higher education and the erosion of trust in academic institutions.",
