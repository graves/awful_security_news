  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), triggered by a software error in its DynamoDB database service in Northern Virginia, disrupted major websites and applications including Duolingo, Roblox, Fortnite, Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, Perplexity, ChatGPT, United Airlines, Canva, Reddit, and Flickr. The incident highlighted how critical AWS infrastructure is to modern digital services, with the error causing a chain reaction of failures due to the platform's role as an 'invisible scaffolding' for much of the internet. Experts note that AWS holds about 30% of the global cloud computing market, and while such providers offer convenience and strong security, the widespread reliance on a few dominant companies creates systemic risk. This event underscores the vulnerability of businesses and consumers to outages in key cloud services and raises concerns about the need for greater resilience and redundancy in digital infrastructure.",
