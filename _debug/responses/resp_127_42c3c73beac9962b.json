  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A massive outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October 2025 disrupted internet services globally, affecting major platforms such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, Netflix, Disney+, and the McDonald’s app. The outage, which began at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and lasted into the afternoon, stemmed from issues in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), causing widespread failures in online services. Amazon reported that 64 internal services were impacted, and recovery was gradual, with full service restoration achieved by 6 p.m. Eastern time. The incident highlighted the world’s increasing dependence on a few major tech companies—especially AWS—for internet infrastructure, with educational institutions like the University of California, Riverside, and Ohio State University reporting significant disruptions to online learning. Experts note that such outages are typically technical, not cyberattacks, and are common due to cloud dependency, though they remain a reminder of the fragility of modern digital systems.",
