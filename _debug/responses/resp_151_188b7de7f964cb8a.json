  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the Diwali festival in October 2025, New Delhi experienced a severe air quality crisis, with its AQI reaching 442—making it the world’s most hazardous city—due to widespread fireworks and ongoing pollution from traffic, industry, and agriculture. PM2.5 levels were over 59 times higher than the WHO’s annual safe limit, and despite a Supreme Court relaxation permitting limited use of 'green crackers,' fireworks were set off beyond allowed times. The Central Pollution Control Board classified the air as 'very poor,' and the Ministry of Earth Sciences forecast poor air quality to persist. The situation is worsened by cold winter conditions that trap pollutants, and pollution from Indian Punjab is also affecting Lahore, Pakistan, highlighting regional environmental challenges and cross-border health risks.",
