  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the widespread resurgence of cowboy imagery in American culture, driven by political trends, media, and fashion. It traces the origin of the cowboy myth to 19th-century Buffalo Bill shows and romanticized Western films, which linked cowboys to patriotism, rugged individualism, and traditional values. Today, the image is commercially and politically pervasive — seen in fashion campaigns by brands like Sweetgreen and Canada Goose, music by Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter,' and TV shows like 'Yellowstone.' The article critiques this myth, pointing out that it ignores the real history of cowboys, who were often Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. Despite growing visibility of Black cowboys through photography and cultural events, mainstream narratives continue to whitewash their contributions. The resurgence is tied to cultural conservatism, especially under the Trump administration, where cowboy symbolism reinforces individualism, anti-elitism, and nationalist ideology. The article concludes that while the cowboy image is deeply embedded in American identity, it remains a mythologized version of reality, disconnected from the actual diversity, labor, and struggles of rural life.",
