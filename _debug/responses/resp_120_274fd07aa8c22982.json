  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing—traditionally the base of operations for the first lady—to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite not obtaining approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which regulates such construction. The project, announced by President Donald Trump, is framed as fulfilling a 150-year-long presidential desire to have a large indoor space to host dignitaries, claiming the current East Room is too small and that pavilions on the South Lawn are outdated. Trump asserts the construction will cost nothing to taxpayers and is privately funded through donations, including a contribution from Carrier Global Corp. for HVAC. However, the demolition of the East Wing, which includes offices of the first lady, raises serious concerns about historical preservation, regulatory compliance, and transparency, especially as the NCPC is currently closed due to a government shutdown. The White House claims temporary relocation of offices and modernization of the wing, but dramatic photos show visible damage to the façade and structural elements. The project, set to be completed before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, marks the largest structural change to the Executive Mansion since 1948, and has drawn public and political scrutiny over its legality, cost, and precedent.",
