  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears while running in the woods near Myoko, Japan. The incident occurred amid a surge in bear attacks across Japan — over 100 injuries and seven deaths this year — attributed to climate change disrupting bears' natural food sources. Halloran sustained severe injuries, including a bitten-off bone in his arm and claw wounds on his leg, requiring multiple surgeries and a long recovery. The Japanese government has responded by announcing stricter measures to control bear populations. Residents are advised to use deterrents like bells, loud music, or bear spray. Halloran, though traumatized, remains committed to returning to running and nature, citing the support of the local running community and the need to remain cautious in the face of rising human-bear conflicts.",
