  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Pediatrics reveals that reversing long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infancy has significantly reduced the prevalence of peanut allergies in the U.S. The shift—based on the 2015 LEAP study, which found that early exposure to peanuts reduces allergy risk—led to a 43% decline in peanut allergies and a 36% decline in overall food allergies among children. The new guidelines, adopted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and included in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, recommend introducing peanuts to high-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months. The study, which analyzed health data from over 120,000 children, shows that this policy change has likely prevented at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy over the past decade. Despite these promising results, experts like Dr. Corinne Keet caution that full adherence remains a challenge due to parental fears and data limitations, such as reliance on diagnostic codes rather than actual dietary records. Importantly, peanut allergies are highly persistent, with only about 10% of affected children outgrowing them.",
