  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s interim president, Jose Jeri, has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital, Lima, to address a wave of protests driven by Gen-Z activists demanding action against corruption and organized crime. The emergency allows the government to deploy the military, restrict protests, and suspend constitutional rights. This follows the impeachment and removal of former President Dina Boluarte, who failed to curb a surge in extortion cases—estimated at 18,000 in 2025, up 30% from the previous year—and a spike in violence, including 1,690 homicides between January and September 2025. The previous state of emergency, declared by Boluarte after the murder of singer Paul Flores in March 2025, proved ineffective. Recent protests turned violent on October 24, resulting in one death and over 100 injuries. Jeri has stated he will not resign, despite pressure, and will serve as interim president until July 2026.",
