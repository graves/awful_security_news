  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that reversing the long-standing advice of avoiding peanuts in infants has significantly reduced food allergy rates in the U.S. Since 2015, when a landmark study (LEAP) found that early exposure to peanuts reduces allergy risk, U.S. health guidelines have shifted to recommend introducing peanuts to high-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months. This change has led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% reduction in overall food allergy rates. Researchers estimate that over 40,000 cases of peanut allergy have been prevented in the past decade. The shift is reflected in national guidelines such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Despite positive outcomes, challenges remain, including incomplete family adherence due to fear of cross-reactivity and limitations in data collection, such as reliance on diagnostic codes instead of actual dietary habits. Experts like Dr. Corinne Keet remain cautious, calling for more validation and long-term data, but agree that the overall trend is a major public health improvement.",
