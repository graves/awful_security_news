  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. The investigation highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the absence of tracking for indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through state-authorized transit permits (GTAs) that do not record individual animal origins. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify whether its beef or leather products contribute to deforestation or human rights abuses. The report points to systemic failures in Brazil’s cattle tracking system, which relies on group-level data rather than individual records. While JBS has previously committed to traceability—such as in its 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement—it has failed to meet those promises. The situation is exacerbated by illegal land encroachments, violence against Indigenous communities, and state agency approval (via Adepará) of cattle movements into protected zones. Though reforms are underway—such as a 2026 traceability decree by Pará’s governor and a federal plan by the Ministry of Agriculture to implement tracking by 2032—these timelines are criticized as too slow. Experts and advocacy groups argue that stronger, government-led, publicly accessible traceability systems are essential to hold companies accountable and halt deforestation linked to beef production.",
