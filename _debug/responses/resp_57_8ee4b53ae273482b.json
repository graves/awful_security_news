  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced intense scrutiny after releasing two survivors of a failed submarine strike in the Caribbean, undermining its claims that they were 'narco-terrorists' posing an imminent threat to American lives. The release contradicts the administration’s narrative of a war-like campaign against drug traffickers, especially as no public evidence supports the allegations. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Jack Goldsmith, argue that the actions violate due process, lack legal justification, and are politically motivated. The absence of congressional approval, transparency in evidence, and the decision to release survivors instead of detaining them or prosecuting them in civilian court highlight serious legal and ethical concerns. The incident reflects a broader pattern of using executive power without oversight, raising alarms among lawmakers and international partners.",
