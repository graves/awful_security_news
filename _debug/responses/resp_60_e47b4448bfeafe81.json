  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, President Donald Trump's domestic approval ratings remain at historic lows, with strong disapproval on economic issues such as inflation and the cost of living. Polling from AP-NORC and CNBC shows that while Trump's approval on Gaza slightly increased to 47%, disapproval remains high, and overall approval is at a second-term low. Americans show little enthusiasm for the deal, reflecting broader skepticism about foreign policy outcomes. Instead, public sentiment is dominated by economic concerns, with only 32% expecting economic improvement and 31% expecting wage growth. A CBS News-YouGov poll further confirms that international issues are low on the public’s priority list. The fragility of the ceasefire and ongoing regional tensions, along with Trump’s economic record, suggest that the deal has little lasting impact on domestic public opinion.",
