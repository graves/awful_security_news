  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, demanded accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies—particularly Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—after reports surfaced that agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls at protests in Chicago without prior warning. The judge had previously issued a restraining order requiring body-worn cameras and restricting the use of force, but expressed concern that the Trump administration was not complying. A hearing was held where officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, denying reports of unapproved tear gas use and asserting compliance with camera mandates. Despite these claims, Judge Ellis requested that Russell Hott, the former ICE Chicago field office head, and Gregory Bovino, CBP chief patrol agent, be deposed to provide direct testimony on field operations. This came amid ongoing protests at the Broadview ICE facility, which saw over 100 demonstrators and more than 30 arrests between September and October 2025, demonstrating sustained public opposition to immigration enforcement actions under Operation Midway Blitz, which resulted in over 1,000 arrests across Illinois.",
