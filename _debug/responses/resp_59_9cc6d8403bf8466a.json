  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, essential federal workers are experiencing heightened anxiety about taking time off, particularly for medical procedures or scheduled vacations. Supervisors are now classifying furlough notices as 'disciplinary and adverse actions' in employee records — a practice not seen before — which raises concerns about professional fairness. Workers at agencies like the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Internal Revenue Service are receiving conflicting instructions: some are told they cannot take leave, even for medical reasons, and may face termination or job loss. The Trump administration has issued reductions in force to about 4,100 workers and has challenged a 2019 law ensuring retroactive pay for furloughed employees. Experts and union leaders say this creates a situation where workers are forced to choose between their health and job security, with one Social Security employee postponing surgery due to fear of being laid off or marked negatively in her record. The practice of labeling furloughs as disciplinary actions is seen as a harmful escalation of mistreatment during a funding lapse.",
