  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking authority to deploy the National Guard in Chicago amid protests against ICE agents. Lower federal courts, including the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, have previously blocked the deployment, citing that Trump overstated the emergency. The administration argues that such decisions fall under presidential authority, referencing the 1827 precedent Martin v. Mott, which affirmed the president’s exclusive power to determine a national emergency. In contrast, opponents argue that the protests do not constitute a national emergency and point to the 1932 case Sterling v. Constantin, which allows judicial review when decisions exceed a 'range of honest judgment.' The case raises a fundamental question about the balance of power between the executive and judiciary, with the Supreme Court requesting a rapid response from state and local officials, indicating urgency and potential for a pivotal ruling.",
