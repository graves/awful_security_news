  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday, October 20, 2025, disrupted thousands of online services worldwide, including banking, social media, airline booking, and e-commerce platforms. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented access to data in AWS services like DynamoDB and EC2. Although AWS is generally reliable, experts warn that the internet's heavy dependence on a small number of cloud providers makes the system vulnerable to cascading outages. Historical events, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, illustrate a recurring pattern of systemic fragility. Experts stress that without greater redundancy and competitive cloud services, the internet remains fragile, despite its scale and ubiquity.",
