  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling has allowed the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court order that had blocked the action. However, due to a still-active second order, the deployment remains pending. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is criticized by dissenting judge Susan P. Graber and state leaders like Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who argue it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The deployment is justified by the administration as a response to violent protests and threats to federal personnel, particularly at an ICE facility. Multiple states—including California, Illinois, and Tennessee—have challenged the deployments in court, citing lack of emergency conditions, constitutional violations, and over-militarization. Public backlash has intensified, with nationwide 'No Kings' protests and legal inquiries launched by senators into the cumulative effects of such deployments. The situation reflects a broader constitutional conflict over presidential power, state authority, and the use of military forces in domestic civil unrest, with the Supreme Court potentially involved in resolving key cases like that in Chicago.",
