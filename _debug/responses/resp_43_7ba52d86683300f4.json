    "The phrase '6-7' is a nonsensical internet meme used by Gen Alpha children to signal group belonging and social inclusion, despite having no clear meaning or origin.",
    "The phrase originated from the song 'Doot Doot (6 7)' by Skrilla, which references the 10-67 police code for reporting deaths, though this connection is speculative and not universally accepted.",
    "The phrase gained traction through a gesture popularized by basketball player Taylen Kinney, who used it to rate a drink with an indecisive hand movement, leading to wider adoption on TikTok.",

    "Teachers are reacting with both frustration and creative adaptation—some ban it, others incorporate it into classroom routines to defuse tension or show acceptance.",

    "While the '6-7' meme is seen as annoying, it is not a sign of brainrot or declining literacy, but rather a normal, generational expression of youth culture and linguistic creativity.",
    "Alternatives like '41' are emerging as potential replacements, signaling a natural evolution of youth slang and cultural cycles.",
    "The phrase is expected to decline in popularity as newer slang emerges and public fatigue grows, indicating a cyclical nature of internet memes."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The '6-7' meme, a nonsensical phrase popularized by a viral song by Skrilla and a gesture from basketball player Taylen Kinney, has become a widespread phenomenon among Gen Alpha students, used to signal group belonging and social connection. Despite having no coherent meaning or origin, it has spread rapidly in schools and online, causing disruption and sparking both frustration and creative responses from teachers. Experts argue that its endurance reflects broader cultural shifts in communication, such as the rise of post-truth dynamics and the prioritization of shared interpretation over factual accuracy. While it may be seen as annoying or trivial, the phenomenon underscores how youth language evolves through play and social identity, and how such expressions, though meaningless, serve a critical function in forming peer communities. The phrase is now facing potential decline, with new slang like '41' emerging as a natural successor, suggesting a cyclical pattern in internet culture.",
