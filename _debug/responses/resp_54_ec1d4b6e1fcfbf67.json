  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is closely scrutinizing the actions of federal agencies—particularly ICE and CBP—during Operation Midway Blitz, a sweeping enforcement campaign in Chicago that led to over 1,000 arrests. The judge expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents to use body-worn cameras during protests, citing concerns that agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls without warning demonstrators. While CBP agents are fully equipped with cameras, ICE’s Special Response Teams are not, and their lack of equipment and training raises concerns. Testimony from officials like Kyle Harvick and Shawn Byers reveals that agents are trained in crowd control and media handling, but incidents involving a pastor, Rev. David Black, who reported being struck multiple times without warning, have sparked public and judicial concern. Leadership in both agencies is described as unstable, with frequent turnover, and the judge plans to continue questioning high-ranking officials to obtain firsthand accounts of the events. The Trump administration has denied claims of unwarning tear gas use, asserting that media reports are selective, adding political tension to the investigation.",
