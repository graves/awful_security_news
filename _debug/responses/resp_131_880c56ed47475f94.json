  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is set to begin a five-year prison sentence at Paris’ La Santé prison for criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his 2007 election campaign with Libyan funds. The conviction, which was delivered without waiting for appeal, is based on the judge’s determination that the offense severely disrupted public order. Sarkozy maintains his innocence and insists on holding his head high during incarceration. He will be allowed to bring 10 family photos and three books, including 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and a biography of Jesus Christ. Former inmates like Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological and physical shock of incarceration, noting that even high-profile individuals are subject to the same basic conditions—small cells, minimal privacy, and strict routines. The prison, historically known for housing figures like Captain Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal, adds symbolic gravity to the event. Public figures, including Sarkozy’s son Louis and wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, have responded with support, demonstrating the broad societal and media attention surrounding this unprecedented political event.",
