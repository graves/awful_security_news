  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Due to a government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, CDC researchers have been unable to attend the IDWeek conference, the largest annual gathering of infectious disease experts in the U.S. This absence stems from federal scientists being unpaid and lacking funding for conference participation, which undermines critical public health discussions on rising threats like measles, whooping cough, bird flu, and superbugs. The shutdown and related administrative actions by the Trump administration—such as communication freezes, layoffs, and restricted research sharing—have severely weakened the CDC’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. Experts like Michael Osterholm are now stepping in to maintain public health knowledge through new open-access publications and private research collaborations. These developments highlight a broader crisis in public health infrastructure, where scientific collaboration and transparency are being compromised, despite urgent disease threats.",
