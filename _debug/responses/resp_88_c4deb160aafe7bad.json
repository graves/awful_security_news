  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated by over a billion people across India, Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji, and the global South Asian diaspora. The festival, meaning 'row of lights,' symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It spans five days, each with unique traditions: Dhanteras (buying gold and cleaning homes), Choti Diwali (Krishna’s victory over Narakasura), Diwali (Lakshmi Puja and family feasts), Padwa (marital harmony), and Bhai Dooj (sibling love). The festival holds deep religious roots, including the story of Rama and Sita’s return, Krishna’s triumph, and the liberation of Guru Hargobind and 52 kings by Sikh tradition. For Jains, it marks the enlightenment of Lord Mahavira; for Buddhists, the conversion of Emperor Ashoka. Celebrations include diyas, rangoli, fireworks, feasting, and gift-giving, with Diwali also marking the start of the new Hindu financial year. While rooted in faith, Diwali has become a widely celebrated cultural event, transcending religious boundaries to reflect universal values like community, prosperity, and renewal.",
