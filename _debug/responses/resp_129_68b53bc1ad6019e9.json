  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military conducted a strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean, suspected of transporting drugs, resulting in the death of several people and the survival of two individuals — an Ecuadorian man named Andrés Fernando Tufiño and a Colombian citizen. Ecuadorian authorities released Tufiño after determining there was no evidence of criminal activity, while Colombia stated that its survivor will face prosecution. The U.S. government, led by President Donald Trump, justified the attack as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, invoking legal precedents from the George W. Bush administration’s war on terrorism. The actions have intensified diplomatic tensions, especially with Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro condemned the strike and was criticized by Trump as a 'lunatic,' and with Ecuador, where President Daniel Noboa emphasized regional unity and peaceful cooperation. Experts question the legitimacy of the fentanyl claim, as little evidence exists for fentanyl production in the Andes, raising concerns about the proportionality and legality of such military actions in international waters.",
