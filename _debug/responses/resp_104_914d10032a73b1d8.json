  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump called on both Ukraine and Russia to 'stop where they are' and end the war, advocating for a ceasefire based on current battle lines. This marks a shift from earlier positions where Trump supported Ukraine reclaiming lost territory. Trump expressed hesitation about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, citing U.S. national security concerns and fears of damaging U.S.-Russia relations, despite Ukraine's insistence that such weapons would pressure Putin into negotiations. Zelenskyy acknowledged the ceasefire proposal but stressed the need for Tomahawks to counter Russian military strength. Trump also signaled a potential meeting with Putin in Hungary, highlighting a strategy of direct diplomacy between the leaders, though Russia has shown no interest in engaging with Ukraine directly. The article underscores a major pivot in Trump’s foreign policy toward the Ukraine war, balancing diplomatic outreach with strategic military caution.",
