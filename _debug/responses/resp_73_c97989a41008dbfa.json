  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six U.S. universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia — have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for agreeing to ideological policy changes. The compact demands that universities remove sex and ethnicity from admissions, cap international enrollment at 15%, define gender based on biological processes, and conduct annual anonymous compliance polls. The schools argue that such demands threaten academic freedom and institutional autonomy, emphasizing that federal funding should be awarded based on merit, not ideological alignment. While the White House sees the initiative as a way to improve higher education through ideological standardization, universities view it as an overreach of federal power and a potential threat to academic independence. The proposal, initially sent to nine institutions on October 1, 2025, has since expanded to include three additional schools, with a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories. The University of Texas at Austin has not rejected the offer, instead expressing openness to dialogue, while Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona are currently reviewing the proposal. California Governor Gavin Newsom has also signaled political resistance by threatening to withhold state funding from institutions that accept the compact, further intensifying the debate over federal and state influence in higher education.",
