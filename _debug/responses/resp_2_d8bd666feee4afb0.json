  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been scrapped, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This reversal follows a previous announcement that a summit would take place within two weeks after a phone call between the two leaders. Diplomatic efforts involving U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov failed to produce meaningful progress, with both sides expressing divergent views on ending the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin rejected the proposal to freeze the conflict, which Trump had previously supported, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the U.S. refusal to provide long-range missiles as a key reason Russia has become less interested in diplomacy. Experts note that Lavrov lacks real influence over Russian policy, making high-level bilateral talks ineffective. The administration now sees no need for a standalone meeting between Rubio and Lavrov, and instead considers future discussions at multilateral events like ASEAN’s upcoming meeting in Malaysia. Despite the delay, the White House reaffirms Trump’s ongoing commitment to achieving peace in Ukraine.",
