  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown in October 2025, Capitol Police officers are working without pay, missing their first full paycheck on October 10. This has drawn bipartisan concern, with lawmakers like Rep. Joe Morelle criticizing the lack of negotiation and political disrespect toward the force, including delayed installation of a Jan. 6 memorial plaque and the pardoning of rioters. Former Chief Terry Gainer notes the immense pressure on officers to serve as both enforcers and public ambassadors, making their job more difficult. The Capitol Police union, led by Gus Papathanasiou, has called on lawmakers to end the shutdown and address financial hardship. While officers say they are holding up for now, one officer warns the situation may not last a month. The Trump administration has proposed using funds to pay law enforcement, though this is legally contested. The situation underscores the human cost of political gridlock and highlights a growing tension between elected officials and the very personnel tasked with protecting democratic institutions.",
