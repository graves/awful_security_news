  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a hearing on October 20, 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, scrutinized the Trump administration’s compliance with her order restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during anti-immigration protests in Chicago. The hearing focused on Operation Midway Blitz, a recent ICE deployment that resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, and sparked widespread protests. Judge Ellis expressed concern that agents may have violated her order by using tear gas without warning, especially at the Broadview ICE facility in Chicago. Although officials from CBP and ICE, including Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified and affirmed adherence to camera use and policy, the judge remained unsatisfied. She ordered depositions of Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino, who were previously in charge of operations in Chicago, due to their senior roles during the protests. The administration denied allegations of unauthorized tear gas use, claiming the reports are selectively edited. The case highlights tensions between federal law enforcement and civil liberties, especially in the context of protest documentation and transparency.",
