    "James Comey, the former FBI Director, has launched two legal motions to have federal charges against him thrown out, citing a personal vendetta from President Donald Trump and the illegitimacy of the prosecutor appointed to bring the case.",
    "The charges stem from allegations that Comey provided false statements and obstructed a congressional proceeding, with Comey pleading not guilty.",
    "Comey's legal team claims the prosecution is retaliatory, pointing to public statements by Trump attacking Comey after he criticized the president, describing this as an example of official reprisal for protected speech.",
    "Comey's attorneys argue that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney after the 120-day limit expired for the previous interim, Erik Siebert, circumvented the Senate confirmation process required by the Constitution's Appointments Clause.",
    "The legal team also references a prior dismissal of Trump's own indictment by a federal judge, which found that Jack Smith's appointment was unlawful, to support their claim that Halligan's appointment is similarly invalid.",
    "Legal experts suggest that judges may be more receptive to such claims due to the public pattern of retaliatory statements from President Trump toward individuals criticized in government."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has filed two motions to have federal charges brought against him for allegedly lying during congressional testimony dismissed, claiming the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unconstitutional. His attorneys argue that Trump’s public attacks on Comey and the circumvention of the Senate confirmation process for Halligan’s appointment violate constitutional protections against retaliation and the Appointments Clause. The case is seen as a pivotal moment in the intersection of executive power, constitutional law, and political accountability, with legal experts suggesting that judges may be more sympathetic given the pattern of targeted political prosecutions and prior rulings on unlawful appointments.",
