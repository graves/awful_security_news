This robbery is seen as a shift from stealing culturally valuable artworks to targeting raw materials like jewelry and coins for easy resale or melting. It parallels the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden and raises concerns about a growing trend of 'grab-and-go' thefts, especially in open, accessible museums. Experts like Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath warn that such thefts reflect a move away from cultural preservation toward economic gain, with stolen items likely broken down for their parts. The theft has triggered a national investigation in France, with officials suspecting a link between multiple recent heists in Paris and a possible organized crime involvement, such as the Remmo clan. The incident has sparked public outrage and highlighted serious security lapses, including unsecured windows and public access to equipment. Interpol has added the stolen crown jewels to its database, signaling broader international concern over cultural heritage theft.",
