  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) around 3:50 a.m. local time on October 19, 2025, after landing from Dubai. The aircraft broke in two upon impact and collided with a security patrol vehicle, killing two occupants. The plane was left partially submerged, with significant damage to its front and tail sections. All four crew members were injured and transported to hospitals; no cargo was on board. The aircraft did not emit distress signals during approach, and the airport suspended operations on the north runway while emergency crews, including over 200 personnel, responded. Two other runways remained operational, minimizing disruption to over 1,000 daily flights. This incident, though rare in Hong Kong’s history of aviation safety, adds to the airport’s legacy of difficult landing conditions and past accidents, such as the 1999 China Airlines crash during a typhoon.",
