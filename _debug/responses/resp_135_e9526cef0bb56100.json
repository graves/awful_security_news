  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean, which killed at least 32 people and injured two survivors, the Ecuadorian citizen Andrés Fernando Tufiño was released due to a lack of evidence linking him to any criminal activity in Ecuador. The Colombian survivor remains hospitalized and will face prosecution under national law. The U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, justified the attacks as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, citing the presence of fentanyl, though experts question the evidence. This has intensified diplomatic tensions between the U.S., Colombia, and Ecuador, with Colombia recalling its ambassador and President Gustavo Petro accusing the U.S. of killing a Colombian citizen. Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa has responded by affirming international cooperation in anti-drug efforts and criticizing unilateral military action. The pattern of attacks, which began in September 2025 and includes at least six incidents, has drawn comparisons to the George W. Bush administration's 'war on terrorism,' raising concerns about the legality and proportionality of such operations.",
