  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public greeting in Handlova. Cintula, a former mine worker and public activist, shot at Fico five times from close range, claiming he wanted to stop policies he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack constituted terrorism due to its targeted nature against a political leader, despite Cintula's claim that he did not intend to kill. The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia between Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition, which accuses Fico of undermining democracy. Fico, who survived with serious injuries, has returned to public duties and expressed forgiveness toward Cintula. The case has sparked a national debate over the legitimacy of political violence and the boundaries of terrorism in political discourse.",
