  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from a recently brokered ceasefire in Gaza — which ended a two-year war by securing the release of 20 living hostages — to pursue high-stakes diplomatic initiatives with Russia and China. Despite initial optimism, the Gaza deal remains fragile due to Hamas's failure to produce remains of deceased hostages, prompting ongoing diplomatic pressure from U.S. envoys like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Trump plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest and with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea to address war in Ukraine and trade tensions. While Trump has expressed willingness to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, he has recently backed off, citing concerns about escalation and winter losses. His diplomatic approach, combining carrots and sticks, is seen as less effective with nuclear powers like Russia and China, which are not dependent on U.S. support. Experts remain skeptical that the Middle East success will translate into immediate shifts in Russian or Chinese strategy, and Trump acknowledges uncertainty about Putin’s true intentions, echoing past diplomatic misjudgments. The article underscores the fragility of peace deals and the long, arduous process of diplomacy — a lesson drawn from George Mitchell’s experience in Northern Ireland.",
