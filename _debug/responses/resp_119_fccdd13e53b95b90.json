  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several leading U.S. universities—including MIT, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the proposal. The Compact would require schools to ban transgender students from using restrooms or playing in gender-aligned sports, freeze tuition for five years, limit international enrollment, and mandate standardized testing. Institutions argue that such policies conflict with academic integrity, scientific merit, and the merit-based allocation of federal research funding. The White House held a virtual meeting with several universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt, and the University of Virginia, to discuss the agreement, but two institutions ultimately refused to sign, citing concerns about political interference in education. This resistance reflects broader concerns about the politicization of higher education and the erosion of trust in academic institutions due to federal funding decisions influenced by political priorities.",
