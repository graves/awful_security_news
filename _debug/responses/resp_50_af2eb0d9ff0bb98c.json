  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS reported a system outage on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, that prevented some of its pharmacies from filling or delivering prescriptions. The company confirmed it had resolved a network connection issue and apologized for the inconvenience, noting minor delays as stores came back online. The outage was reported amid growing public frustration on social media platforms like X, where customers shared issues with accessing prescriptions and flu shots. This incident occurred in the context of a prior AWS outage that disrupted global internet services, including hospitals, banking apps, and smart home devices, highlighting how society’s reliance on cloud-based systems makes critical services vulnerable to technical failures. CVS, with over 9,000 U.S. locations and recent expansion by acquiring Rite Aid stores, faces both operational and strategic challenges in maintaining reliable service delivery.",
