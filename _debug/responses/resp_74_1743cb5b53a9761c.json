  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are experiencing significant anxiety over a diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, sparked by Trump’s accusations that Petro promotes illegal drug production and his threats to cut US subsidies and tariffs. Petro denies the claims, calling Trump 'rude and ignorant,' while both leaders face public criticism for their confrontational rhetoric. The conflict threatens Colombia’s economy, as the US is its largest trading partner and source of anti-drug funding; a tariff hike could harm exports and cause job losses. Additionally, Petro’s past criticism of US actions led to visa revocation, and ordinary citizens, including taxi drivers, housewives, and students, express fear about economic and personal consequences. The situation underscores a broader issue: unresolved drug trafficking in Colombia and the dangers of political posturing that disproportionately affects civilians.",
