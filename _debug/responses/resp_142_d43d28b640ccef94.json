  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approached, bringing heavy rainfall and a moderate risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The storm’s eye is forecast to pass near the island later on Saturday, a region historically among the first to face cyclones from the western Pacific. Over 9,000 people were moved to safer areas, following regular evacuation drills. The Philippines, which experiences around 20 storms annually, is increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, with recent disasters including earthquakes and typhoons that have left the country still reeling from loss of life and infrastructure damage.",
