  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen detained 20 United Nations employees in the capital Sanaa, including 5 Yemenis and 15 international staff, following a raid on a UN facility. The rebels confiscated all communication equipment, including phones and servers, from the site. The detainees belong to multiple UN agencies, such as the World Food Program, UNICEF, and OCHA. This incident is part of a long-running crackdown by the Houthis on UN and humanitarian operations in Sanaa, Hodeida, and Saada, where over 50 staff have been detained previously. The UN has suspended operations in Saada and moved its top coordinator to Aden due to safety concerns. The Houthis have falsely accused detained staff of spying, a claim the UN has firmly denied. The event underscores the growing threat to international humanitarian efforts in conflict-affected Yemen.",
