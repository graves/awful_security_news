  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China, which claims its measures are a defensive response to U.S. trade curbs on its industries, argues that Washington is applying a 'double standard' in national security justifications. The actions come just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, with experts suggesting China’s export controls are a strategic move to gain leverage. Historically, the U.S. has used tariffs and export controls—such as those on semiconductors and Huawei—to restrict China’s technological advancement, while China has maintained a near-monopoly on rare earths essential for global technology. The current situation reflects a broader pattern of great power competition, where both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence. Experts note that although the U.S. holds greater strategic cards, both sides are holding back from de-escalation due to reputational and strategic concerns, and the outcome will depend heavily on global market reactions and economic resilience.",
