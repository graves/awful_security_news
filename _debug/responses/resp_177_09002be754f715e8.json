  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed that European troops are ready to deploy to Ukraine within weeks if a ceasefire is reached between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The coalition of the willing, a group of 26 European nations including the UK, has developed detailed military plans involving over 200 planners from 38 nations, with a projected spending of over £100 million. The UK will grant its soldiers new powers to shoot down drones threatening military bases, a move prompted by drone attacks at US airbases and across Europe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been invited to a proposed Trump–Putin summit in Budapest but remains open to participating. The article highlights escalating tensions over territorial concessions, with Trump reportedly pressuring Zelensky to surrender parts of Donbas, and leaders from Poland and Finland warning against appeasement. Healey also notes that Putin sees Britain as his 'number one enemy' and stresses that the risk of broader European conflict has increased significantly since WWII.",
