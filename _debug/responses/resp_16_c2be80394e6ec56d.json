  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' alleging that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister' — widely interpreted as Prince Andrew — during her time in Epstein’s network. The memoir claims she was violently beaten, choked, and humiliated, with the prince reportedly laughing and becoming aroused. The allegations deepen the ongoing transatlantic scandal involving powerful figures tied to Epstein. Prince Andrew denies all claims, having previously claimed to have broken off ties with Epstein in 2010, but emails show he continued contact into 2011. He paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022 and recently stepped back from using his royal titles, saying he prioritizes family and duty. The memoir also alleges that Andrew’s team tried to hire online trolls to discredit Giuffre, and that new evidence contradicts his public statements. The publication reignites public and political scrutiny of the British royal family and their connections to Epstein.",
