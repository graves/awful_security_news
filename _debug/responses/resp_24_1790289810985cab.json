  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Millions of Americans are at risk of losing access to food stamps in November due to the federal government shutdown, with the USDA warning that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of funds in two weeks. The Trump administration blamed Democrats for the shutdown, claiming they prioritized political agendas over food security, while Democrats argue that Republicans refused to negotiate a spending deal including extended Obamacare subsidies. Although WIC was temporarily protected by a $300 million tariff revenue infusion, SNAP lacks sufficient funding, with its $6 billion contingency fund falling short of the $8 billion needed for November benefits. As a result, 17 states have suspended new food stamp applications. Advocacy groups emphasize that the program is especially vital around Thanksgiving and that urgent action is needed to prevent widespread food insecurity among vulnerable families.",
