  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. The timeline begins with Craig’s romantic relationships and online searches on poisons, including 'how to make murder look like a heart attack' and specific dosages. He purchased toxic substances via Amazon and a grocery store, and delivered potassium cyanide to his office, where it was unknowingly opened by an employee. Craig later replaced a medication with cyanide, and Angela, despite being treated at multiple hospitals, suffered worsening symptoms and died on March 18, 2023. The case revealed a premeditated plan, detailed online research, and a disturbing pattern of toxic procurement. Key figures like office manager Caitlin Romero and business partner Dr. Ryan Redfearn raised concerns, leading to crucial investigative developments. The case underscores the dangers of toxic substance access, the potential for domestic violence disguised as illness, and the importance of workplace vigilance in identifying suspicious activity.",
