  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article outlines the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a 100% tariff threat by President Donald Trump against Chinese goods, in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. This move follows a history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions dating back to 2018, with earlier actions by both leaders—including Trump’s 25% tariffs and Biden’s restrictions on semiconductors and Huawei—highlighting a long-standing economic and strategic rivalry. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security, accusing the U.S. of discriminatory practices and overreach. Experts note that both sides are using economic tools as instruments of power, with China leveraging rare earths and the U.S. using tariffs and export controls. The conflict is expected to be resolved or further escalated during an upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea, with the outcome depending on global market reactions and the willingness of each side to de-escalate. The article emphasizes that the trade war reflects a deeper pattern of security-economic interdependence, where both nations are strategically constraining each other’s technological and industrial capabilities.",
