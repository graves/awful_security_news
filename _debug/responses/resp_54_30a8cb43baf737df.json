  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new schools superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a controversial mandate introduced by former Superintendent Ryan Walters that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and integrated into school curriculum. The policy, which was criticized by civil rights groups and led to a pending lawsuit, was seen as a religious overreach in public education. Fields, appointed by Governor Kevin Stitt after Walters resigned to take a private-sector job, stated that such religious instruction should be decided at the district level and that taxpayer funds should not be used for Bibles. The state education department is now reviewing all of Walters’ policies—including a teacher ideology exam for applicants from California and New York—potentially rescinding them as well. This move reflects broader concerns about the role of religion in public schools and the political influence on education standards.",
