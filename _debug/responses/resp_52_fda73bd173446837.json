  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. The court ruled that Cintula committed a terrorism offense by specifically targeting the prime minister, citing his motive to oppose Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. While Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico from continuing policies that he believed harmed Slovak society, the defense argued the act did not constitute terrorism. The verdict has highlighted deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of fueling anger and critics accusing him of undermining democratic institutions. Fico, who returned to power in 2023, has faced criticism over policy shifts including ending military aid to Ukraine and reorganizing public broadcasting. Despite the severity of the attack, Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula, and Cintula plans to appeal the sentence, calling it 'unjust'.",
