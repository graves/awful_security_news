  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel has identified the bodies of two hostages taken during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023: Arie Zalmanowicz, an 85-year-old man from Kibbutz Nir Oz who was killed in captivity, and Master Sgt (res) Tamir Adar, a 38-year-old community security officer who died resisting Hamas gunmen. Their remains, transferred via the International Committee of the Red Cross, mark 15 of the 28 deceased Israeli hostages returned under the first phase of the ceasefire. Israel demands Hamas fulfill its obligations to return all deceased hostages, citing outrage over incomplete deliveries, while Hamas claims it faces difficulties locating Palestinian bodies amid extensive rubble from Israeli bombing. The agreement also included the release of over 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, though violence has flared again. The conflict continues to claim over 68,000 lives in Gaza since October 2023, according to Hamas health ministry reports.",
