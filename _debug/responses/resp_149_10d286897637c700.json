  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against citizens using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, stating that these models offer a biased, distorted, and polarized view of political parties. Tests revealed that AI consistently recommended extreme parties—such as the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party—while largely ignoring centrist parties like the VVD and Democrats 66. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of democratic elections, as voters may be misled into supporting parties that do not align with their true preferences. The authority urges both voters and AI providers to avoid using AI for political advice, emphasizing that AI systems lack transparency and verifiability. The warning comes amid rising political tensions, including the PVV’s strong performance following a coalition breakdown over immigration policy, which underscores the urgency of maintaining informed, independent democratic decision-making.",
