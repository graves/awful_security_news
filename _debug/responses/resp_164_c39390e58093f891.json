    "The coalition, formed between the LDP and the Japan Innovation Party, would provide 231 seats in the lower house, two short of a majority, meaning additional party support would be needed to pass legislation.",

    "The vote for the new prime minister is scheduled for Tuesday, and if it goes to a second-round run-off, Takaichi would only need more votes than her opponent."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sanae Takaichi, the 64-year-old right-wing leader of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is set to become the country’s first female prime minister following a coalition agreement with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin). The deal, brokered by co-leader Hirofumi Yoshimura, provides the LDP with enough parliamentary seats to secure a vote for Takaichi, after the centrist Komeito party ended its 26-year alliance with the LDP over concerns about funding rules and Takaichi’s hardline stance on China. While the coalition holds 231 seats—two short of a majority—Takaichi would only need a majority in a potential second-round run-off. However, her rise has drawn criticism from Japanese women and commentators, such as sociologist Chizuko Ueno and political commentator Chiyako Sato, who argue that her leadership is not necessarily inclusive or progressive, and that it does not signal a transformation of gender dynamics in politics.",
