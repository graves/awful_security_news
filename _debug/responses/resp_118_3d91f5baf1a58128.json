  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has introduced new policies for its AI video tool Sora 2 in response to intense criticism from Hollywood talent agencies, unions, and performers over unauthorized AI-generated content featuring real people. The AI tool has been used to create fake videos of historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Robin Williams doing things they never did, and even involving copyrighted characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants. These creations have sparked outrage from family members, like Robin Williams’ daughter Zelda, who called the content 'horrible slop'. Talent agencies including United Talent Agency and Creative Artists Agency have condemned the use of performers’ likenesses and intellectual property without consent, labeling it as exploitation. In response, OpenAI has implemented an 'opt-in' policy, allowing individuals to control whether they can be simulated, and has agreed to remove existing non-compliant content, including fake Martin Luther King Jr. videos. The controversy has prompted a push for federal legislation—the 'NO FAKES Act'—to establish legal consent requirements for digital replicas, building on California's existing law. The Motion Picture Association has also reported widespread copyright infringement, underscoring the need for stronger ethical and legal frameworks in AI-generated creative content.",
