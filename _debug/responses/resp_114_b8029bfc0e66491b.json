  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign a political funding compact proposed by the Trump administration approaches, several top institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the agreement. The proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education mandates policies such as banning transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports aligned with their gender identity, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized tests for admissions. These policies have drawn strong opposition from academic leaders who argue that such mandates undermine scientific merit, academic integrity, and inclusive education. Despite a White House meeting with multiple universities to discuss the Compact, no binding agreement has been reached, and dissent continues to grow. The situation highlights a growing conflict between political policy mandates and institutional autonomy in higher education, with significant implications for research funding, student rights, and trust in academic institutions.",
