  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed formal approval of the Net Zero Framework (NZF)—a global carbon-pricing system for shipping emissions—by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. Although the framework had already been approved in April 2025, Trump’s public backlash and threats of visa restrictions, port levies, and sanctions prompted a reversal in voting, with 57 members supporting the delay to 49. Key supporters like China, the EU, and the UK backed the measure, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted or opposed it. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of emissions, aims to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. The delay is seen as a setback for global climate action, undermining industry investment and increasing uncertainty for maritime operations amid accelerating climate impacts such as extreme storms and altered ocean currents.",
