  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, known for founding the Guardian Angels and running in 2021, is under growing pressure to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race. This pressure comes directly from his boss, John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC radio and publicly urged Sliwa to step down, claiming he should love New York more than anything else. The broader Republican effort to oppose the Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has led to strong appeals from Andrew Cuomo, who runs as an independent and dismisses Sliwa as not viable, comparing him to Mamdani ideologically. Sliwa has publicly rejected these claims, emphasizing his connection to blue-collar working-class voters and criticizing billionaire donors like Bill Ackman and Andrew Cuomo, who he claims are determining the outcome of the race. President Donald Trump mocked Sliwa’s affinity for cats and animal rescues, further signaling Republican disinterest. Despite the pressure, Sliwa has doubled down on his candidacy, asserting that voters should have the final say, and Mamdani has dismissed rumors of coordination between the two candidates, both calling for New Yorkers to make the decision independently of elite influence.",
