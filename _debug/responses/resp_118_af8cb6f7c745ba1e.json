  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race is unexpectedly close, with Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli competing in a historically blue state. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, has gained support from former President Barack Obama and is criticized for being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation. Ciattarelli, a pro-Trump figure and former Assembly member, has received endorsement from President Donald Trump despite earlier criticism of him, and has faced accusations from Sherrill that he downplayed opioid risks and caused tens of thousands of deaths. Both candidates are engaging in personal attacks, with Sherrill’s campaign accusing Ciattarelli’s past business of promoting dangerous medical misinformation. The race is being shaped by national politics, voter concerns about affordability and rising utility costs (such as a 17% to 20% electricity bill increase), and the fact that New Jersey has not elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. Despite Democrats’ voter registration advantage, the state’s history of purple gubernatorial elections suggests a competitive race with no clear frontrunner.",
