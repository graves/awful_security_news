Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that circumcised children have a doubled risk of autism, citing a 2013 and 2015 study and a 2025 unpublished preprint from WPLab. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, state that neither the 2013 nor 2015 studies establish a causal link, both have significant methodological flaws including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use, and the 2025 WPLab preprint is not peer-reviewed and promotes a speculative, non-consensus claim that acetaminophen triggers autism. Acetaminophen is considered safe when used appropriately, and decades of research do not support a link to autism. The claim is widely criticized for misrepresenting data and ignoring confounding variables.",
