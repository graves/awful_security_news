  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and significant coaching changes. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter, becoming the first team to reverse an 18-point lead after three quarters. Second-year quarterback Bo Nix delivered a standout performance, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two, culminating in a game-winning field goal. Meanwhile, Drake Maye set a new Patriots franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, surpassing Tom Brady’s previous 88.5% mark, marking a pivotal moment in the team’s transition. On the downside, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets both suffered major losses, resulting in quarterback benchings — Tua Tagovailoa was replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers after three interceptions, and Justin Fields was benched at halftime due to poor performance. The Jets remain winless at 0-7, raising questions about team stability. The season has seen 26 lead changes in the final two minutes — the most in NFL history — highlighting the growing unpredictability of outcomes. These events underscore both the resilience of teams in high-pressure situations and the fragility of stability in coaching and player performance.",
