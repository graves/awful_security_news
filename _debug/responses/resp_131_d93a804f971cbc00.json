  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—effective from December 1, 2025. These controls apply to both raw metals and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals detailing the intended use of the products. China justified the measures as a national security response to foreign entities using or transferring Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes. The move occurs just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning China's actions as a strategic signal to strengthen its leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China, and the restrictions directly impact critical defence technologies like fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors. Analysts from CSIS and the University of Montana interpret the controls as a calculated 'pre-meeting choreography' designed to pressure the US and widen the strategic gap in critical mineral supply chains. Exemptions are granted for emergency medical and disaster relief purposes.",
