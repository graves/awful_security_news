  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown, national parks across the U.S. face significant challenges due to the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees. While many parks remain open with state support, the absence of rangers and enforcement has led to increased incidents of illegal activities such as drone flights and base jumping in places like Yosemite and Grand Canyon. Local businesses report mixed outcomes—some remain stable, while others like Mountain Mama in Harpers Ferry see reduced bookings. Meanwhile, closures of major attractions like the Smithsonian museums in D.C. have redirected tourist traffic to private museums, leading to a 50% increase in visitors at places like Mount Vernon. Advocacy groups warn that without proper staffing, parks face safety risks, environmental degradation, and potential backlogs in emergency and maintenance operations. Economic impacts are significant, with Destination DC estimating a $47.4 million loss during past shutdowns. The article underscores the complex interplay between political disruption, public access, safety, and local economies, highlighting both resilience and vulnerability in the face of prolonged government inaction.",
