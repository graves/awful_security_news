  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage on 2025-10-21 disrupted vital UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting concerns about over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, which collectively hold 30–40% of the UK and European cloud market. Experts and regulators emphasize the 'nested dependency' risk, where even non-hosted services rely on core cloud infrastructure, leading to cascading failures. Despite the benefits of scale, cost-efficiency, and security, the dominance of a few providers raises serious concerns about national resilience, data sovereignty, and market competition. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority has called for regulatory action, including designating AWS and Azure as 'strategically market significant', to promote fair competition. Experts recommend policy-driven solutions—such as mandating multi-provider cloud usage and continuous data replication—to reduce dependence and strengthen digital resilience, with government leaders like Lord Leong signaling efforts to diversify the UK’s cloud ecosystem.",
