  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 federal government shutdown, the White House announced it would redirect tariff revenue — specifically from Section 32, which supports child nutrition — to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), preventing a collapse of services for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision was made in response to a funding lapse caused by Congress’s failure to pass a spending bill for fiscal year 2026. Although the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it stressed uncertainty around funding amounts, disbursement timelines, and sustainability. The move sparked legal debate, with experts arguing that the administration lacks authority to redirect funds without congressional appropriation. Bipartisan figures, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and critics of Senate leadership, highlighted the political and humanitarian impact of the shutdown on vulnerable populations. The article underscores broader tensions between executive action and legislative oversight, as well as the importance of stable, long-term funding for vital social programs like WIC.",
