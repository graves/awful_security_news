  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season, the Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks each delivered standout performances on Monday Night Football. Jahmyr Gibbs had a breakout game with 218 total yards and two touchdowns, the most by a Lions player since Calvin Johnson’s 2013 performance, helping the Lions defeat the Buccaneers 24-9. Meanwhile, in a tight win over the Texans, Jaxon Smith-Njigba excelled with eight catches for 123 yards and a touchdown, leading the league in receiving yards. The night also saw a major injury to Tampa Bay Buccaneers' star wide receiver Mike Evans, who suffered a broken clavicle after a collision, ending his 11-season streak of 1,000+ receiving yards and leaving the Buccaneers’ receiving corps severely weakened. These events highlight both offensive momentum and the fragility of star players in the NFL, with implications for team strategies and playoff positioning.",
