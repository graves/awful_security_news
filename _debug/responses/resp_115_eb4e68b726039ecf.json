  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays, after a dramatic 7-game ALCS victory over the Seattle Mariners, have returned to the World Series for the first time since 1993. The Blue Jays, who surged from last place in the AL East in 2024 to a 94-68 record in 2025, defeated the Mariners with a 4-3 series win, including a pivotal Game 7 loss where the Mariners committed three errors and were halted by a three-run homer from George Springer. The Los Angeles Dodgers, with the highest payroll in baseball and a history of success, are now the opponents in the World Series, having swept the Milwaukee Brewers and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the postseason. The Dodgersâ€™ dominance, especially in the NLCS where Shohei Ohtani delivered a historic performance, makes them a formidable challenge. While the Blue Jays boast strong offense, the Dodgers' superior pitching and defense, especially in high-pressure situations, present a significant obstacle. The World Series opener is set for October 24, 2025, in Toronto, marking a historic and intense showdown between a team with a long playoff drought and a franchise that has been a consistent powerhouse.",
