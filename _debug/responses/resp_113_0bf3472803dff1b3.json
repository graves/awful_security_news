  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how the Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement by deploying the National Guard to cities like Chicago, D.C., and Memphis, often under the guise of combating urban crime. Despite data showing that violent crime has declined, officials continue to conflate illegal immigration with lawlessness. These deployments are legally questionable, as the National Guard cannot make arrests and are generally prohibited from domestic policing under the Posse Comitatus Act. The article highlights confusion among residents, especially undocumented immigrants, who fear that masked agents could be ICE or military personnel. The actions are further linked to prior operations such as Operation Lone Star in Texas, where military forces used tear gas on migrants. Legal experts argue that these deployments are not just about law enforcement but serve as a response to protests triggered by aggressive immigration tactics, creating a cycle of fear and militarization. The article underscores the political and legal tensions between federal authority and state leadership, and raises serious concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the politicization of immigration enforcement.",
