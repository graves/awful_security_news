Her leadership follows a fragile coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party (Ishin no Kai), following the departure of the centrist Komeito party. Takaichi, a staunch conservative and protege of Shinzo Abe, emphasizes strengthening Japan’s defense, the Japan-U.S. alliance, and economic growth. She is set to host U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling a key moment in Indo-Pacific diplomacy. However, her government lacks a parliamentary majority, making it politically unstable. Criticisms include her opposition to gender equality, same-sex marriage, and male-only imperial succession, as well as her historical ties to the Yasukuni Shrine. These policies have drawn concern from China, South Korea, and human rights advocates, while also being celebrated by some Japanese citizens as a historic breakthrough.",
