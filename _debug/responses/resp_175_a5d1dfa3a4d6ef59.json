  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on October 21, 2025, disrupted critical UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns about over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. With both AWS and Azure holding 30–40% market share in the UK and Europe, and many digital services depending on their underlying infrastructure, the incident exposed deep 'nested dependencies' that can amplify outages. Experts warn that assuming these providers are inherently resilient is flawed, and that the current concentration of cloud computing power poses significant economic and geopolitical risks. While the economies of scale offered by these hyperscalers make them attractive, the lack of competition and data sovereignty concerns have led calls for stronger policy intervention. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has flagged poor market competition and recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to enforce fair competition. Experts and government officials now advocate for mandatory data resilience standards, multi-cloud usage, and increased participation from UK and European cloud providers to build a more resilient, sovereign, and competitive digital infrastructure.",
