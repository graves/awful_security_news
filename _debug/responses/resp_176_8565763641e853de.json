  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the context of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel has received two bodies from Hamas, which claims they are two deceased Israeli hostages. This brings the total number of confirmed deceased hostages to 15 under the first phase of the agreement. The bodies were transferred via the Red Cross and escorted by the Israeli military to Tel Aviv for identification, with families to be notified once confirmed. Hamas has previously transferred a Palestinian body, citing difficulties in locating remains amid rubble from Israeli bombing. The ceasefire agreement includes reciprocal releases: Israel has freed over 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, while Hamas has returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for each Israeli hostage. Despite the agreement, violence has flared, and there remains public outrage in Israel over the incomplete return of deceased hostages. Since the start of the conflict following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, over 68,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to Hamas-run health data, which is regarded as reliable by the UN.",
