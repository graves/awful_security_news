  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, with a major deployment of troops, naval assets, and aircraft including F-35s, drones, and B-52 bombers. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico has been reopened and is now a key operational hub. The buildup includes training missions, surveillance flights, and live-fire drills near Venezuela, with some assets diverted from Europe. While the US does not have the capacity for a full invasion, the military actions—such as flying bombers near Venezuela and deploying special operations aircraft—are widely interpreted as a strategic pressure campaign aimed at weakening President Nicolás Maduro’s regime. Experts argue that the actions are primarily a signal of strength rather than a direct military confrontation, with the possibility of remote strikes via Tomahawk missiles remaining an option.",
