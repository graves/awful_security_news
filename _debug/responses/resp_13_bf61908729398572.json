  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, composed of public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has issued a public statement urging vaccination amid growing concerns about misinformation from federal officials. The coalition criticizes recent CDC recommendations against the MMRV vaccine for young children and the political claims made by former President Donald Trump, which they argue have eroded public trust in vaccines. A measles outbreak in South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students highlights the real-world dangers of declining vaccination rates. Local health officials emphasize that public health decisions must be based on science, not political ideology, and stress the importance of regional collaboration due to the interconnectedness of communities. Despite the federal government’s efforts to restore trust through scientific review, public confidence in the CDC has declined significantly, with only half of Americans expressing trust in its vaccine messaging. This article underscores a broader crisis in public health governance, where political interference and misinformation threaten both scientific integrity and community safety.",
