  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A brazen heist at Paris’ Louvre Museum in October 2025, during which thieves used industrial tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch to steal nine Napoleonic crown jewels from the Apollo Gallery, marks a worrying escalation in museum theft. The attack, which occurred during daylight hours and involved a coordinated, military-style operation, reflects a shift from stealing high-value artworks to targeting artifacts that can be melted down or stripped for raw materials—such as gold and diamonds. This trend is supported by similar incidents, including the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden and the 1990 Gardner Museum robbery. Experts like Remigiusz Plath and Laura Evans warn that such heists signal a growing threat to cultural heritage, with stolen items potentially lost forever due to dismantling. The theft of the Empress Eugénie’s crown and the pattern of attacks on Parisian museums—including the Natural History Museum and a Limoges museum—raise concerns of a coordinated, organized crime campaign, possibly linked to groups like the Remmo Clan. French officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have expressed national outrage, citing security failures in public museum access and infrastructure. Interpol has added the stolen items to its database, underscoring the international dimensions of the crime.",
