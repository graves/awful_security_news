  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article by Greg Rosalsky explores Cory Doctorow's theory of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms from user-friendly, innovative services into exploitative, profit-driven systems. Doctorow outlines a three-stage process: initial user acquisition (Stage 1), favoring business customers at user expense (Stage 2), and profit maximization through user and merchant exploitation (Stage 3). Platforms like Facebook and Amazon are cited as prime examples, with specific claims about data misuse, algorithmic manipulation, predatory pricing, and 'junk fees' that erode seller profits. The article attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak antitrust enforcement, particularly the reliance on the consumer welfare standard. Doctorow proposes solutions including stronger antitrust policies, a 'right-to-exit' policy, and greater interoperability between platforms to break monopolistic control. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, the article presents a compelling critique of how dominant platforms may be systematically degrading user and business experiences over time.",
