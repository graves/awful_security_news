  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "France’s former president Nicolas Sarkozy began serving a five-year jail sentence at La Sante prison on October 21, 2025, becoming the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned. The sentence stems from a conviction of criminal conspiracy for accepting millions of euros from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to fund his 2007 election campaign, a claim he has consistently denied. Presiding judge Nathalie Gavarino described the crimes as of 'exceptional gravity,' justifying the sentence even if an appeal is filed. Sarkozy will be held in solitary confinement in a nine-square-metre cell with limited contact, and his lawyers have immediately filed a release appeal, which the court will review within two months. The case has sparked significant public emotion, with supporters gathering outside his home to demand his freedom, and it marks a rare moment in French political history as the first French leader since WWII collaborationist Philippe Petain to be imprisoned.",
