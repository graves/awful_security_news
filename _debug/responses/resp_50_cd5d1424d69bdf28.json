  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a pivotal moment of the 2025 MLB postseason, the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-2 in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, forcing a decisive Game 7. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth home run of the playoffs, extending Toronto’s lead to 5-0 and sealing the win. The Mariners' loss was amplified by three fielding errors — including two in the second inning — which allowed early runs. Pitcher Trey Yesavage delivered strong performance with 31 splitters and limited damage, but the team's defensive breakdowns proved costly. This marks the first time the Mariners have played a Game 7 in their history and the second for the Blue Jays since 1985. The winner of the series will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, with Game 1 scheduled for Friday.",
