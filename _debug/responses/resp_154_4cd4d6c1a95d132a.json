  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the long history of theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris, highlighting key incidents such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia, the WWII-era efforts to protect artworks from Nazi looting, and multiple other thefts involving paintings and jewellery. The latest 2025 heist, in which eight Napoleonic jewellery pieces were stolen from the Galerie d’Apollon, is distinct because of the high intrinsic value of the items—allowing thieves to recut and resell them without traceability. Art historian Noah Charney explains that such thefts are especially difficult to recover, as the components can be sold anonymously. The article underscores the evolving nature of museum security, from weak 19th-century safeguards to modern, technically sophisticated robberies that target items with high material value rather than just cultural fame.",
