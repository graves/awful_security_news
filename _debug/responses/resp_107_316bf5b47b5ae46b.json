  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays, after overcoming the Seattle Mariners in a hard-fought seven-game ALCS, have earned their first trip to the World Series in over 30 years, marking a dramatic turnaround from their 2024 performance. The Blue Jays, who defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS with a 34-run offensive surge, faced a formidable opponent in the Dodgers, who have dominated the postseason with a two-time World Series title and a strong regular season. The Dodgers, led by two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, have been unstoppable in the playoffs, including a record-setting performance in Game 4 of the NLCS. However, their bullpen has proven to be a weakness, offering the Blue Jays an opportunity to exploit. The Blue Jays' path to the World Series was not easyâ€”they were pushed to the brink by the Mariners' 14 home runs and dominant pitching, and their victory in Game 7 was secured by a late three-run homer from George Springer. The World Series will begin on Friday, October 24, in Toronto, marking a historic moment for the Blue Jays and a major test for the Dodgers, who are aiming for their first repeat championship in 25 years.",
