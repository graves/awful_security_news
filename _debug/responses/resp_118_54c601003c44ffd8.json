  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a sharp escalation of violence, Israel launched strikes across Gaza targeting Hamas terror infrastructure, including weapons storage and tunnel systems, in response to alleged attacks on Israeli troops in the Rafah area. Hamas denies any involvement in the attacks, accuses Israel of violating the ceasefire and fabricating justifications, and claims it was cut off from its forces in Rafah. The U.S. reported credible intelligence that Hamas was planning attacks on civilians, further complicating the fragile ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the deaths of two soldiers and the killing of a family of 11 in a bus attack, which Israel claims was due to an imminent threat beyond the yellow line. The ceasefire agreement, brokered by the U.S., includes the release of remaining Israeli hostages and the return of some bodies, though it remains under threat due to repeated violations. The article highlights the deepening human and political costs of the conflict, with both sides accusing each other of breaches and escalating violence.",
