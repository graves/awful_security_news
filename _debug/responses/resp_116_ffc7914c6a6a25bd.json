  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has introduced a sweeping policy to de-register international humanitarian organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, citing ideological grounds such as support for 'terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism,' often applying these standards broadly to statements deemed antisemitic. This move follows Israel’s earlier ban of the UNRWA agency from providing aid in Gaza, despite no evidence linking its staff to Hamas. The new registration process, overseen by COGAT, requires approval from a committee including Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, and has already led to the de-registration of major groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, Israel continues to restrict access to only two of seven border crossings, with many aid trucks waiting months in Egypt and Jordan. Humanitarian officials warn that the restrictions threaten the ability to deliver life-saving supplies amid widespread destruction, including over 90% of homes in Gaza, and that the policy appears designed not to improve aid delivery but to systematically eliminate organizations that do not align with Israeli political narratives.",
