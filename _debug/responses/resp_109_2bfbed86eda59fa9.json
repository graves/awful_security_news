  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) have been shown to modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants exhibit social distancing behaviors—such as infected workers isolating and nurses increasing distance from foragers—while also altering physical nest structures to reduce disease spread. These changes include greater compartmentalization, more spaced nest entrances, and longer travel routes, which reduce transmission risks. The study, led by behavioral ecologist Nathalie Stroeymeyt and systems biologist Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, demonstrates a form of 'architectural immunity' in social insects. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest these natural strategies could inspire better human designs of public and communal spaces to prevent disease transmission, offering a novel, nature-based approach to public health.",
