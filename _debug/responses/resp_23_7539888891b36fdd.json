    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, admitted to shooting Fico five times from a distance of just over 1 meter, resulting in serious injuries including abdominal wounds, hip, hand, and foot trauma.",
    "The court ruled that Cintula committed terrorism, not just murder or a simple attack on a public official, citing his specific targeting of the Prime Minister and his stated motives related to opposition to Fico's policies on Ukraine, media, and culture.",
    "The verdict highlights deep political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the liberal opposition of inciting societal anger, while the opposition claims he has undermined democratic standards, media freedom, and transparency.",
    "Cintula has stated he wanted to stop Fico’s policies, which he claimed damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and described the act as a 'scream against fear paralyzing society'.",
    "Fico, who has returned to power since 2023, has claimed to have forgiven Cintula despite ongoing health issues from the attack.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism, and Cintula’s status as a pensioner and former activist was emphasized as context.",
    "Judge Igor Kralik justified the terrorism charge by noting that the attack targeted a specific political figure, not a random citizen."

The attack, in which Cintula shot Fico five times from just over a meter away, left the prime minister seriously injured. The court ruled that the act constituted terrorism due to the specific targeting of a political leader and Cintula's stated opposition to Fico's policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. The verdict underscores deep political and societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of fueling societal anger and the opposition accusing him of undermining democracy. Despite Cintula’s claim that he wanted to stop Fico’s policies without killing him, the defense argued that not all attacks on officials are terrorism, and Cintula expressed intent to appeal the decision. Fico, who has returned to power and made policy shifts including ending state military aid to Ukraine, has claimed to have forgiven Cintula.",
