  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has intensified restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank by banning the UNRWA from operating and de-registering major international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) under new ideological criteria. These measures, which include requiring approval from a committee with Israeli political and diaspora representatives, have been criticized as politically motivated, with organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps facing rejection or de-registration. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and most aid requests are denied without explanation. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire, with over 90% of homes and infrastructure destroyed, and food insecurity declared. UNRWA, the largest aid provider, is blocked from delivering supplies stored in Egypt and Jordan, and U.S. funding cuts have further strained its operations. The article highlights a global crisis of humanitarian access, where political motives appear to be overriding the urgent need for life-saving aid.",
