    "The Nobel Prizes are among the most prestigious international awards, established by Alfred Nobel’s will in 1895, recognizing individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "The prizes are awarded across six categories: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences, each administered by a different institution.",
    "The 2025 medicine prize was awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have paved the way for treatments in cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "In 2024, Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the medicine prize for discovering microRNAs; in physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton were honored for foundational work in machine learning and artificial neural networks.",
    "In chemistry, David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper were recognized for breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, notably through the AI system AlphaFold.",
    "The 2024 literature prize went to Han Kang for her powerful exploration of violence and memory in works like The Vegetarian and Human Acts.",
    "The 2024 peace prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo for its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons.",
    "The 2024 economics prize was shared by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for their research on how inclusive institutions drive long-term economic growth and reduce inequality.",
    "The nomination process is confidential, with experts, academics, and past winners submitting nominations by January 31, and decisions kept secret for 50 years.",
    "The Peace Prize announcements have drawn significant attention in 2025 due to speculation about U.S. President Donald Trump, who claims he deserves the prize for ending wars, though experts say his chances are slim due to the prize's focus on durable peace and institutional efforts.",
    "The Norwegian Nobel Committee has expressed concern about political interference in science, with Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences criticizing the Trump administration’s impact on academic freedom."
