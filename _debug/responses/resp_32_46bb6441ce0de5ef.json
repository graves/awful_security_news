  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Marine Corps conducted a 250th-anniversary live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, California, firing artillery shells over the I-5 interstate highway — a route not used for such activity in over 70 years. One of the 155mm shells fired by an M777 Howitzer detonated prematurely, sending fragments that damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. The incident raised serious safety concerns, especially given that the shell had previously been used successfully in similar firings. The demonstration, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was part of a broader military tradition to showcase strength during high-profile visits. However, the premature detonation — despite theoretical safety due to high altitude — is seen as abnormal and potentially linked to manufacturing issues previously reported in 2024, including shell cracks and a shift in explosive composition. The U.S. has dramatically increased 155mm shell production since 2022 to support Ukraine’s war effort, with over 3 million rounds delivered. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the firing as dangerous and closed the highway ahead of the event, sparking a political and public debate over military safety and tradition.",
