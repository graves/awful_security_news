  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a federal government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, essential federal workers at agencies like the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and IRS are facing unprecedented anxiety over taking leave. Employees fear that even medically necessary absences — such as surgeries — could be treated as disciplinary actions, with furlough notices being stored under 'disciplinary and adverse actions' in personnel records, a category not used previously. Conflicting guidance from supervisors, including warnings that absence equates to being absent without leave (AWOL), has created confusion and distrust. The Trump administration has issued reductions in force (RIF) notices to about 4,100 workers, and is threatening further layoffs, while also challenging a 2019 law that ensures retroactive pay for furloughed workers. Experts warn this pattern of mistreatment — treating leave as a disciplinary issue — undermines employee well-being and trust in government. Workers report feeling forced to choose between their health and their jobs, highlighting a broader crisis of morale, transparency, and fairness in federal employment during a political impasse.",
