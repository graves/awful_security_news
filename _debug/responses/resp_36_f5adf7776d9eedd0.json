Multiple Republican senators, including Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and James Lankford, have expressed caution and stated they will evaluate Ingrassia during a scheduled confirmation hearing.

His lawyer has disputed the authenticity of the messages, claiming they are satirical or manipulated. Despite these denials, the nomination appears to be dead, with Thune stating 'he’s not going to pass' and suggesting the White House withdraw the nomination.",
