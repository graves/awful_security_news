  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed formal approval of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to reduce shipping emissions by introducing a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax, due to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump accused the IMO of passing a 'global carbon tax' and threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on supporting countries, including China, the EU, and Singapore. While 63 countries had previously backed the NZF, Argentina and Singapore changed their stance, and the vote was delayed until late 2025. Climate leaders and industry representatives criticized the move as undermining urgent climate action, with Vanuatu calling it 'unacceptable' and the International Chamber of Shipping warning that lack of clarity hampers investment in decarbonization. The framework aims to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, in response to growing climate impacts such as extreme storms and shifting ocean currents.",
