  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six major U.S. universities—including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—have rejected a proposed federal funding compact initiated by the Trump administration. The compact, sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, demands ideological reforms such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment at 15%, and adopting biology-based gender definitions. In return, schools would receive preferential federal grants, invitations to White House events, and priority access to funding. The administration claims the compact fosters a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and improves higher education. However, universities argue that the proposal threatens academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. Several institutions, including Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, are reviewing the proposal, while the University of Texas at Austin has expressed openness to dialogue. State officials like California Governor Gavin Newsom have also signaled resistance, threatening to withhold state funding to schools that participate. The White House has set a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories, adding urgency to the standoff over federal control of higher education.",
