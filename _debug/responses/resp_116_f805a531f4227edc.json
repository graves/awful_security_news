  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a sharp escalation of violence, Israel launched military strikes across Gaza targeting Hamas terror infrastructure, including weapons storage, firing posts, and tunnel networks, in response to alleged attacks by Hamas militants in the Rafah area. Hamas denied any involvement, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and fabricating justifications, while also claiming it was cut off from operations in Rafah. The Israeli government confirmed the deaths of two soldiers and the killing of a family of 11 in Gaza City, which the Israeli military attributed to a vehicle crossing beyond the yellow line. The U.S. reported credible intelligence that Hamas was planning attacks against Palestinian civilians, further threatening the ceasefire. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S. and tied to the release of 20 Israeli hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, is now under severe strain, with Gaza’s Health Ministry reporting over 68,000 Palestinian deaths in the two-year conflict. Humanitarian aid was temporarily halted but later resumed, while both sides accuse each other of breaches, raising global concerns about regional stability and human rights.",
