    "President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic could be priced at $150 per month, sparking widespread interest and concern among patients and medical professionals.",

    "Patients currently pay significantly more—up to $500 per month—especially without insurance, making compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs a common workaround.",
    "Stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dropped sharply after the announcement, indicating investor concern over potential pricing reductions.",
    "The proposed price of $150 aligns with global prices for semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) in countries like France and with some compounded versions in the U.S., suggesting potential affordability improvements.",
    "Medical experts agree that a $150 price could greatly increase access and uptake of GLP-1 medications, but emphasize that even this price may still present financial barriers for many patients.",
    "There is skepticism about whether the price will actually reach $150, with experts noting it may be more of a negotiating tactic than a promise of immediate change.",
    "The announcement is part of a broader 'Most Favored Nation' initiative, where the U.S. aims to match drug pricing in peer nations, including deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and EMD Serono.",
    "Compounded GLP-1 drugs, while cheaper, are not regulated and pose safety and efficacy concerns, leading some doctors to discourage their use.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic could be priced at $150 per month, sparking widespread excitement among patients and medical professionals who have struggled with high costs. Although Dr. Mehmet Oz, the White House’s health administrator, clarified that the price reduction has not been finalized and is still under negotiation, the announcement led to significant stock drops at Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, indicating investor concern. Patients like Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell, who rely on compounded or discounted versions of GLP-1 drugs, express strong hope for affordable access, with one patient group collectively losing over 260 pounds. Experts agree that a $150 price would greatly improve affordability and access, but caution that even this price may still be out of reach for many, especially given prior research showing that prices above $100 per month lead to lower medication adherence. The proposal is part of a broader 'Most Favored Nation' initiative aimed at aligning U.S. drug pricing with peer nations, though it remains unconfirmed and may serve more as a negotiating tactic than a guaranteed outcome.",
