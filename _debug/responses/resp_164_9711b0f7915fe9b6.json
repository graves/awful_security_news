  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sir Philip Pullman, renowned author of the His Dark Materials and Book of Dust series, has urged the UK government to reform copyright laws to prevent the unauthorized scraping of writers' books by AI systems. He argues that such scraping—where literary works are used to train AI without compensation—is immoral, exploitative, and akin to theft, asserting that creators should be paid. Writers including Kate Mosse and Richard Osman have echoed these concerns, warning that AI scraping could undermine the future of creative industries. The UK government has responded by launching a consultation on AI and copyright in December 2024, with over 11,500 responses and the formation of expert working groups. Pullman, who is completing his Book of Dust trilogy with the release of The Rose Field on 23 October 2025, also emphasizes the importance of imagination as a form of perception, using Lyra’s journey to illustrate how imagination can reveal realities beyond physical measurement. He criticizes current education policies and organized religion as suppressors of curiosity, and while he rejects the label of 'fantasy writer,' he believes his stories reflect real human experiences through imaginative lens. He also shares personal reflections, including a memoir on his childhood and a speculative idea that his daemon would be a raven, a symbol of storytelling and intelligence.",
