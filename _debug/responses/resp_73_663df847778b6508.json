  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The victory comes amid a deepening economic crisis marked by declining natural gas exports, high inflation, and fuel shortages, which eroded public trust in MAS. Paz, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), won 54.5% of the vote and will take office on November 8, 2025. His moderate platform, advocating private sector-led growth and gradual reform, contrasted with Quiroga’s proposed austerity and IMF-backed measures. Despite a narrow legislative majority, Paz’s government faces significant challenges, including securing fuel supplies and maintaining social programs to avoid labor protests. The election marks a historic political turning point, with both candidates pledging stronger U.S. diplomatic ties and financial support. Paz’s campaign was amplified by his populist running mate Edman Lara, who resonated with younger and working-class voters. Analysts see this shift as a pivotal moment in Bolivia’s democratic and economic trajectory, signaling a potential pivot away from state-led socialism toward market-oriented reform.",
