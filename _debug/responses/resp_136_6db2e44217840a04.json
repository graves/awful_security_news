  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage on October 20, 2025, beginning at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and resolving by 6 p.m. Eastern time, affecting over 2,500 companies and disrupting services including social media (Snapchat), gaming (Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming (Netflix, Disney+), and educational platforms (Canvas). The root cause was traced to a failure in AWS's domain name system (DNS), which translates web addresses into IP addresses. The outage exposed the world's growing dependence on a small number of tech companies for critical internet infrastructure. Experts noted that such disruptions, while impactful, are typically due to technical failures and resolved within hours, and are not usually the result of cyberattacks. The incident underscored the vulnerability of digital ecosystems when centralized cloud services fail, impacting not just users but also education, finance, and everyday technology like smart speakers and doorbells.",
