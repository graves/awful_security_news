  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Madagascar, youth-led protests have driven political change, culminating in the removal of President Andry Rajoelina and the military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina, who was sworn in on 17 October 2025. In response, the Gen Z Mada movement has strongly criticized the appointment of businessman Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as prime minister, accusing it of being made without transparency or consultation—contrary to the youth movement's goal of structural political reform. The protests initially began due to water and power outages but expanded into broader demands for accountability and democratic change. Gen Z Mada insists on full transparency in the selection of Rajaonarivelo and vows to continue monitoring and mobilizing if the process is not justified.",
