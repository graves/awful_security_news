    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and describes how internet platforms degrade over time, shifting from user-friendly environments to profit-driven, user-harming systems.",
    "Enshittification occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (user acquisition), Stage 2 (favoring business customers), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at user and business expense).",
    "Facebook is cited for changing user feeds to target ads, forcing publishers to publish more content, and charging for boosted posts.",
    "Amazon is accused of cloning products, charging junk fees (45–51 cents per dollar earned), and distorting search results so that top results are more expensive and lower in quality.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to lack of competition and absence of strong consumer protection regulations, especially the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Proposed solutions include stronger antitrust enforcement, a 'right-to-exit' policy (e.g., taking e-books from Kindle), and greater interoperability between platforms (e.g., allowing Android apps on iPhone or cross-platform messaging).",
    "Despite criticism from Amazon, Doctorow's claims are supported by studies showing higher prices, lower search quality, and artificial barriers to competition.",
    "The anti-tech monopoly movement has gained traction globally, including among conservatives, suggesting policy solutions can reverse enshittification."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow, a long-time internet activist and journalist, introduces the theory of 'enshittification' to describe how major internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade from user-friendly early stages into profit-driven, exploitative systems. He outlines three stages: in Stage 1, platforms attract users with strong value and minimal data harvesting; in Stage 2, they begin favoring business customers by enabling targeted ads and favorable conditions for merchants, often at the expense of users; in Stage 3, platforms aggressively squeeze profits from both users and businesses, leading to worse search results, predatory pricing, and forced content changes. Doctorow attributes this degradation to a lack of competition and weak regulation, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. He proposes policy solutions such as a 'right-to-exit' policy and greater interoperability between platforms to restore user trust and fairness. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, Doctorow cites studies to support his assertions, and the article highlights growing public and political interest in reversing the enshittification of the internet.",
