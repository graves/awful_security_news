  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article debunks four common haircare myths: cold water does not enhance shine, split ends cannot be repaired, hair growth cannot be accelerated by cutting, and infrequent washing leads to scalp problems. Experts Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker, along with Professor Laura Waters, emphasize that healthy hair depends on proper scalp care, balanced water temperatures, and avoiding over-reliance on products that offer false solutions. The article promotes simple, evidence-based practices such as washing every other day for oily hair, using sulfate-free shampoos for dry hair, and using dry shampoo only occasionally to maintain scalp health.",
