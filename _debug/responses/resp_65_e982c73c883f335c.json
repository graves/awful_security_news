  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite claiming a major diplomatic victory with the Gaza ceasefire deal, President Donald Trump faces minimal public support in the United States. Polls show little improvement in his approval ratings, with strong disapproval on both the Gaza deal and his economic policies, particularly inflation and rising living costs. Americans show little interest in foreign policy, with only 4% prioritizing international events. The article concludes that the economy—especially inflation and job insecurity—remains a far more pressing concern than the Gaza deal, and that public skepticism about peace agreements is rooted in past failures, such as the short-lived Biden ceasefire.",
