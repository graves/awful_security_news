  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is to deliver an advisory opinion on Israel's legal obligations toward UN agencies, particularly Unrwa, in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Following Israel's laws banning Unrwa’s operations and restricting aid deliveries since January 2025, the UN General Assembly requested the ICJ to determine whether such actions breach international law, specifically UN conventions protecting the independence of UN agencies and Israel’s duties as an occupying power to ensure humanitarian access. The ICJ is assessing two key legal questions: whether Israel’s ban on Unrwa violates its obligations under international law, and whether restrictions on aid crossings into Gaza violate humanitarian principles. Israel disputes the findings, calling the ICJ process a political overreach and claiming it undermines its security and self-defense rights. Meanwhile, Unrwa continues providing vital services despite being banned from operations and facing visa restrictions, with reports of staff casualties and humanitarian crises. This case is significant not just for Unrwa but for the global legitimacy of international institutions and the enforceability of UN rules when a major member state challenges them.",
