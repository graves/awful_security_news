  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the umbrella of the United Nations, has issued a global call to action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events. With nearly half of all countries lacking adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities—especially in developing nations—the organization highlights that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without such systems. Over 2 million people have died from weather, water, and climate-related hazards in the past 50 years, with 90% of those deaths occurring in developing countries. While progress has been made—such as the expansion of early-warning systems from 52 to 108 countries—the assessment reveals that half still have only basic capacity and 16% have less. The situation is particularly dire in conflict-affected regions. Real-world examples, including the May 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland that led to the evacuation of Blatten, underscore the life-saving potential of early warnings. The WMO stresses that early warning systems are not just about alerts, but about enabling early action to protect lives, infrastructure, and economies, especially in the face of increasingly extreme weather driven by climate change.",
