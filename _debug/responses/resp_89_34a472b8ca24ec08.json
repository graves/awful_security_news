  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump suggested during an Oval Office news conference that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic could be priced at $150 per month, a dramatic reduction from current U.S. prices of $1,000 or more. While patients such as Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell expressed hope for greater affordability and access, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the CMS administrator, clarified that the price has not been finalized and is still under negotiation. The proposal sparked immediate market reactions, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly stocks falling significantly, signaling investor concern. Experts caution that even a $150 price may not be fully affordable for many patients, and compounded versions — though cheaper — carry safety and regulatory risks. The announcement is seen as part of a broader strategy under the Most Favored Nation framework, which aims to bring U.S. drug prices in line with those in other countries. Despite the potential benefits, analysts say the move is more likely a negotiating tactic than a guaranteed outcome, and significant further details and transparency are needed before such a price reduction becomes a reality.",
