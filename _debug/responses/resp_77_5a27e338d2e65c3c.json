  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned by Hamas to Israel, following the return of Ronen Engel’s body. With only 16 of the 28 hostage bodies still missing, the ceasefire — which entered its second week — is under strain due to delays in the return of the remaining remains, slow aid access, and Israeli military strikes. Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains, while Israel alleges it holds information on missing bodies and uses them as leverage. The Rafah crossing remains closed, cutting off humanitarian aid, and both sides accuse each other of violating ceasefire terms. Protests in Israel and warnings from the US State Department about potential attacks by Hamas add to the tension. The return of hostages is seen by Israeli leaders as a condition for ending the war, with Prime Minister Netanyahu asserting that full compliance with the ceasefire, including body returns and Hamas disarmament, is essential.",
