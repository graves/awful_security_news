  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "City health officials, through the Big Cities Health Coalition, are urging widespread vaccination in response to growing misinformation and policy shifts at the federal level. The coalition, representing leaders from major U.S. cities, criticizes the CDC and HHS for political overreach and lack of scientific integrity, pointing to declining public trust and real-world outbreaks like measles in South Carolina. They highlight that misinformation from former President Donald Trump and recent changes to childhood vaccine schedules—such as the CDC’s recommendation against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4—are undermining public health. Despite the federal government’s claims of restoring trust, data from the KFF shows only half of Americans now trust the CDC. The article emphasizes that public health remains a local responsibility, with cross-jurisdictional cooperation essential due to shared populations and disease transmission risks.",
