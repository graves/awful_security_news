  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence at La Santé Prison in Paris for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has served time behind bars. Sarkozy, who left office in 2012, has appealed his conviction and continues to claim innocence, calling the judicial process politically motivated and damaging to France’s reputation. He is expected to be housed in the prison’s VIP wing, historically used for high-profile or dangerous inmates, including former dictators and notorious criminals. His legal team has requested early release, with a court decision due within two months. The case has drawn global attention to campaign finance ethics, political accountability, and the treatment of former leaders in the justice system.",
