Protesters, including public figures such as Sen. Raphael Warnock, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Bill Nye, emphasized threats to democracy, free speech, and immigrant rights. Demonstrations were held in major cities and small towns across the U.S., featuring nonviolent tactics such as yellow symbols of unity, inflatable costumes, and chants like 'No hate, no fear.' While largely peaceful, some incidents of violence were reported, including arrests and physical altercations. The protests reflect deep public concern about the erosion of democratic institutions, with participants citing fear, loss of civil liberties, and economic hardship as key motivators. The demonstrations also highlighted the role of federal workers, civil rights history, and the growing resistance to federal overreach, especially in Democratic-led communities.",
