  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with Donald Trump at the White House ended without securing key Ukrainian demands, including access to American long-range Tomahawk missiles or binding security guarantees. Despite initial expectations that Trump would acknowledge Putin's untrustworthiness and support Ukraine's war effort, the conversation instead emphasized de-escalation and a personal rivalry between the two leaders, with Trump suggesting a ceasefire and a return to pre-war battle lines. Ukrainian officials and citizens alike express deep disappointment, viewing the meeting as a failure that undermines Ukraine's ability to pressure Russia into meaningful negotiations. The article highlights both the diplomatic realities of U.S. foreign policy and the enduring resolve of Ukrainian civilians to continue fighting in defense of their nation.",
