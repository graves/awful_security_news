  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered earlier in 2025, is progressing better than expected, according to US Vice President JD Vance, who visited Israel to monitor implementation and push for negotiations on long-term peace. Despite progress, tensions remain high as Hamas continues to face pressure to disarm and return all deceased hostages, with Israel refusing to engage in talks until it fulfills these conditions. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are involved in efforts to advance the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan, including the establishment of a Palestinian interim government and international military presence. Meanwhile, humanitarian efforts by the World Food Programme are strained due to limited aid crossings, with only two crossings—Kerem Shalom and Kissufim—operational and located in the south, leaving northern Gaza with severe food shortages. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of the 28 deceased Israeli hostages, but remains under scrutiny for fulfilling all commitments. The situation remains fragile, with fears that Israel may abandon the ceasefire and resume military operations if Hamas violates the agreement.",
