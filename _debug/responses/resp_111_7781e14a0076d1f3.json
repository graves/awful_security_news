  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean are being repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for detention and prosecution. The strike, part of a broader campaign since early September, targeted a vessel reportedly carrying mostly fentanyl and other narcotics, with at least three people killed â€” one more than previously reported. Trump framed the operation as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, invoking the same legal authority used by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11, treating traffickers as enemy combatants. This marks at least the sixth such military action in the region, signaling a significant escalation in U.S. military operations against drug trafficking in the Caribbean.",
