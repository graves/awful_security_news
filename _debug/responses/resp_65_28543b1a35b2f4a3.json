With SpaceX having experienced multiple failures and a slow development pace, NASA is considering opening up the contract to other companies, including Blue Origin, which could provide a Blue Moon lander for Artemis III. The Artemis III mission, set for mid-2027, is vital for NASA to maintain its lead in the global space race against China, which aims to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. NASA has issued an RFI to the entire commercial space industry to explore alternative approaches and accelerate mission timelines. While Blue Origin has stated it is ready to support, the feasibility of in-orbit refueling and technical challenges remain significant. Dynetics and other companies may also be considered in future competition, reflecting a broader strategy to diversify risk and ensure mission success.",
