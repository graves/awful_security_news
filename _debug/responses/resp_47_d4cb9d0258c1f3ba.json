  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is investigating federal enforcement actions during Chicago’s protests under Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In response to concerns about the use of force and lack of transparency, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to activate body-worn cameras during interactions with demonstrators. While CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not, and have not been issued equipment. Testimony from federal officials revealed that agents are trained in crowd control and press interaction, yet incidents like one involving Pastor David Black being struck with pepper balls without warning have raised serious questions about compliance and accountability. Judge Ellis plans to depose former ICE field office head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts of events, highlighting concerns over leadership instability and inconsistent enforcement practices.",
