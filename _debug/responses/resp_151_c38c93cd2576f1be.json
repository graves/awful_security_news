  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five previously unregulated ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), and restricted access to refining technology. These restrictions, which will take effect on December 1, 2025, are framed as measures for national security, citing concerns over sensitive transfers to military applications. The move comes just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning China to strengthen its leverage in trade negotiations. The U.S. remains the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, with 70% of its imports from China between 2020 and 2023, and critical technologies like F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors rely on these metals. Analysts interpret the announcement as a strategic signaling move, demonstrating China’s ability to weaponize its supply chain dominance, thereby increasing pressure on the U.S. to negotiate favorable terms. The restrictions do not affect emergency medical or disaster relief exports, and the U.S. faces significant challenges in maintaining its defence and technological capabilities without secure access to Chinese rare-earth inputs.",
