  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the growing issue of 'stay-or-pay' agreements in the workplace, where employees may be required to repay employers for benefits like on-the-job training, signing bonuses, or tuition reimbursement if they leave before completing a specified stay period. These agreements, often criticized as abusive and limiting worker mobility — especially in industries like healthcare, retail, and transportation — are now being challenged by labor advocates. A landmark law signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom bans repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprentice programs) and for benefits when employees are let go without cause. The law also allows limited stay-or-pay agreements for signing bonuses and tuition reimbursement for transferable credentials, with repayment prorated and a two-year stay period cap. Employees are now given the option to take bonuses at departure. The article highlights that such agreements have evolved from high-skilled professions in the 1990s to lower-wage, minority-dominated industries, and that similar legislative efforts are underway in other states, including New York, signaling a national movement toward greater worker protections.",
