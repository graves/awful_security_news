  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court to allow National Guard deployment in Chicago and Memphis, escalating a conflict with Democratic governors over the use of military forces on U.S. soil. A federal judge in Illinois blocked the deployment, citing a lack of evidence for a 'danger of rebellion,' and this decision was upheld by a federal appeals court. The Supreme Court, which has previously sided with the Trump administration in similar cases, is now being asked to intervene. In Memphis, Republican Governor Bill Lee deployed National Guard troops to address violent crime, but state officials argue the move violates the state constitution and sets a dangerous precedent. Protests and past use of chemical agents at ICE facilities in Chicago have heightened tensions. Meanwhile, a California judge ruled the Los Angeles deployment illegal, though troops remained. The dispute reflects broader political and legal conflicts over executive power, state sovereignty, and the use of military forces in domestic enforcement.",
