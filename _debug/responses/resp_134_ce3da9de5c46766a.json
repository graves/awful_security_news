  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China, sparked by Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, which China responded to with tighter export controls on rare earth metals. This comes amid a history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions dating back to Trump’s first term, including a period of high tariffs raised to 145% and 125% before being reduced. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security and a reaction to U.S. policies targeting Chinese entities in defense and technology sectors. Experts note that both nations are using economic tools as part of a broader great power competition, with China appearing more strategic and the U.S. more reactive. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea adds diplomatic urgency, while analysts emphasize that the outcome will depend on how global markets and economies respond to the ongoing escalation. The conflict underscores the deep interconnection between economic and security policy in the 21st-century geopolitical landscape.",
