Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico has reopened as a key operational hub. The activities include live-fire training, reconnaissance missions, and B-52 bomber flyovers near Venezuela's coast. These actions are primarily interpreted as a pressure campaign aimed at weakening Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump administration reportedly considering strikes inside Venezuela. Experts emphasize that the force is insufficient for an invasion but sufficient to signal military intent and disrupt Venezuelan operations. The US has also diverted intelligence assets from Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, indicating a strategic realignment. Despite Venezuela’s defensive capabilities, the US maintains the ability to conduct remote strikes using Tomahawk missiles from Caribbean naval assets.",
