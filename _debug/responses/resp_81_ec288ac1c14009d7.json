  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration’s imposition of high tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—is driving up the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% year-over-year increase in retail coffee prices. With the U.S. importing over 99% of its coffee and Brazil being the largest supplier, these tariffs are directly impacting roasters like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting, who report rising input costs and operational strain. Despite efforts to diversify suppliers and reduce reliance on affected countries, consumers in cities like Washington, D.C. are feeling the pinch, with average coffee prices rising by 3–4%. A bipartisan legislative effort—the 'No Coffee Tax Act' introduced in September—aims to exempt coffee from tariffs. While consumers may shift brands or cut back, coffee remains an affordable luxury, and most are unlikely to abandon consumption habits despite the price hikes.",
