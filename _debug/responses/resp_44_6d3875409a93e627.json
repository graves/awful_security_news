  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes and medications with arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline (a component of eyedrops). The poisoning occurred over several days in March 2023, beginning with her consumption of a protein shake containing the poisons. Craig planned the crime by creating a hidden email account, researching lethal substances, and purchasing toxic chemicals through online platforms. Key evidence included searches for how to make murder look like a heart attack, orders for arsenic and cyanide, and the delivery of a cyanide package to his office, which was accidentally opened by staff. A hospital staff member, Caitlin Romero, raised concerns, which led to her partner and business partner visiting the hospital and alerting medical staff. Toxicology tests confirmed high levels of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline in Angela’s blood. She died on March 18, 2023, after a series of hospitalizations. The case underscores the dangers of unregulated access to toxic substances, the importance of medical vigilance, and the role of employee suspicion in detecting foul play.",
