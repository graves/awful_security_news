  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, with Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth metals. China claims these measures are a justified response to US trade restrictions and national security actions, while accusing the US of 'double standards.' The situation builds tension ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea. Historically, both nations have engaged in tit-for-tat tariff escalations, including from 2018 to 2024, with the most recent surge occurring in October 2025. The conflict centers on strategic resources like rare earths, critical for high-tech industries, and advanced technologies such as semiconductors and AI. The US has implemented export controls on tech and software, targeting Chinese firms like Huawei and TikTok, while China expanded its national security framework to justify export restrictions. Experts suggest both sides are using economic tools to gain leverage, with China possibly aiming to strengthen its position in negotiations and the US signaling toughness to maintain pressure. The article underscores the deepening economic and strategic rivalry between the two global powers, with potential market instability and long-term implications for global trade and technology development.",
