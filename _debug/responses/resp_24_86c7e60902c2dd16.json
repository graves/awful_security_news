  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. It poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where heavy rainfall—potentially over one foot—could trigger flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the storm could bring rough surf and rip currents to the East Coast, with Florida, the Bahamas, and Cuba as potential secondary impact zones. Melissa’s development is being fueled by extremely warm Caribbean waters, a trend linked to climate change, and it reflects a broader pattern of rapid intensification seen in recent storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Two main track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa turns north to strike Hispaniola, and another where it moves west toward Central America. The article underscores the growing danger of late-season tropical storms and the increasing influence of climate change on storm behavior.",
