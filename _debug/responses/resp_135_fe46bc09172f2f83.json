    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals by adding five new metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—to the list of restricted materials, bringing the total number of restricted rare-earth elements to 12 out of the 17 total.",
    "The new controls apply to both rare-earth metals and specialized technological equipment used in refining those metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals from Beijing.",
    "The restrictions will take effect on December 1, 2025, giving the US and other nations approximately 2.5 months to adapt to the new conditions.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth metals and products, importing $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for advanced technologies including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, AI semiconductors, fighter jets, submarines, and missile guidance systems.",
    "China cited national security and international non-proliferation concerns, noting that certain foreign entities have transferred or processed Chinese rare-earth materials for military use, posing threats to its security.",
    "The move is interpreted as a strategic signal to strengthen China’s leverage during upcoming high-level diplomatic talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea.",
    "Analysts, including Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS and Kristin Vekasi of the University of Montana, describe the action as a 'pre-meeting choreography' designed to signal China’s willingness to use its supply chain dominance as a diplomatic tool.",
    "While the restrictions may hurt US manufacturing and defence capabilities, China faces economic risks as well, due to the interdependence of the US-China supply chains.",
    "Certain exports—such as those for emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief—will be exempt from the new restrictions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—effective from December 1, 2025. The restrictions apply to both raw materials and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain Beijing approval for exports. This move comes just before a planned high-level meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The U.S. is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, with 70% of its imports originating from China between 2020 and 2023, and these metals are critical for defence systems like F-35 jets and submarines, as well as for civilian technologies such as electric vehicles and AI. Analysts interpret this as a 'pre-meeting choreography' to demonstrate China’s ability to weaponize its supply chain dominance. While the move aims to protect China’s national security, it also risks disrupting global supply chains and deepening the technological and industrial gap between the US and China.",
