  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 22, 2025, the bodies of Arye Zalmanovich, the oldest hostage taken by Hamas during the October 7, 2023 attacks, and Tamir Adar, a farmer and educator who died defending Kibbutz Nir Oz, were returned to Israel from Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed their identities and the recovery process continued under the terms of a U.S.-proposed ceasefire agreement signed on October 9, 2025. While Hamas has returned 15 of the 28 deceased hostages, Israel and the U.S. remain concerned about the difficulty of recovering all bodies, especially those buried under rubble or missing entirely. The return of these two bodies is significant both symbolically and emotionally, as it represents closure for families and underscores the ongoing challenges in resolving the hostage crisis. US Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the difficulty of the process, stating that recovery is not going to happen overnight, but emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to bring bodies home for proper burial.",
