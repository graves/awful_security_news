  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Due to a government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, CDC researchers were unable to attend IDWeek, the largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts in the U.S., despite the rise in measles, whooping cough, and other disease threats. The shutdown has led to unpaid federal scientists, canceled conference appearances, and restricted dissemination of critical research, including findings on long-term post-COVID outcomes. The CDC has already lost a significant portion of its workforce, and the Trump administration’s policies—including layoffs and funding cuts—have undermined public health response. In response, researchers like Michael Osterholm are launching new open-access publications and forming foundation-backed collaborations to continue vital public health work. The situation highlights a critical failure in scientific communication and public health preparedness during a time of rising infectious disease risks.",
