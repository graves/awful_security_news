  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes public reactions to President Donald Trump’s actions during his second term, focusing on the extent to which his policies — including mass deportations, investigations of political rivals, and broad pardons for January 6 defendants — exceeded public expectations. While many Americans believed Trump would carry out these actions, polling data suggests they were not considered highly likely. Joe Rogan expresses surprise at the brutal nature of the deportations, reflecting a broader sentiment that Trump has gone beyond what voters anticipated. Polls show a significant decline in belief that Trump is fulfilling his campaign promises, especially among independents and Republicans. The article concludes that public opinion has shifted, with a growing number of Americans now viewing Trump’s actions as excessive and contrary to what they expected, even among those who supported him in the election.",
