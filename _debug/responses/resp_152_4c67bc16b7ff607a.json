  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the Diwali festival in October 2025, New Delhi experienced one of the worst air pollution episodes globally, with its air quality index reaching 442 due to fireworks, traffic, industry, and agriculture. PM2.5 levels were over 59 times the WHO's recommended annual limit, making the air highly hazardous. Although India’s Supreme Court permitted limited use of low-emission 'green crackers,' widespread violations led to increased pollution. The Central Pollution Control Board classified the air as 'very poor,' and the Ministry of Earth Sciences predicted continued poor conditions. The crisis is exacerbated by winter smog, with New Delhi and neighboring regions, including Lahore, Pakistan, affected by transboundary pollution from agricultural fires in Indian Punjab. The situation underscores the urgent need for regional cooperation and effective pollution mitigation measures.",
