  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the October 2025 federal government shutdown, essential federal workers at agencies like the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Internal Revenue Service are facing unprecedented pressure to remain on duty. Many are being told they cannot take scheduled sick or vacation leave, even for medical procedures, and are being warned that absence could lead to disciplinary action or termination. Furlough notices are being stored in employee records under 'disciplinary and adverse actions,' a practice never seen before during funding lapses. This creates significant anxiety, with workers choosing to cancel planned surgeries or vacations to protect their jobs. The Trump administration has issued over 4,100 reductions in force notices and is challenging a 2019 law that guarantees retroactive pay for furloughed employees. Conflicting guidance from supervisors, especially at the IRS and VA, has left workers confused and fearful. Experts and union leaders argue that treating furloughs as disciplinary actions is a form of mistreatment and undermines employee trust in the federal system.",
