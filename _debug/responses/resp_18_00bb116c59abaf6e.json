The decision, made in consultation with King Charles III, Prince William, and other royal family members, follows years of intense public scrutiny over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and alleged connections with a Chinese intelligence operative, Yang Tengbo.

The move comes amid renewed media attention, including a planned release of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir detailing her alleged experiences with Epstein and Andrew. While the decision may signal a shift in royal family dynamics, critics argue it is too little, too late, and questions remain about whether the royal institution can fully recover from the scandal.",
