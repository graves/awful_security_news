  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike in Gabes, Tunisia, brought the city to a standstill as tens of thousands of residents and workers protested against the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which they blame for severe environmental and health crises. The plant, opened in 1972, has been linked to widespread gas poisoning, cancer, and the collapse of marine life, with over 200 people hospitalized in recent weeks. Despite a 2017 government pledge to shut it down, authorities have instead increased production, citing phosphate as a national economic pillar. The UGTT labor union led the protests, calling for accountability and the immediate dismantling of polluting units. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination' and blamed past administrations for ecological damage. In response, Chinese companies have been deployed to manage emissions and prevent further pollution of the Mediterranean, marking a growing international response to the crisis.",
