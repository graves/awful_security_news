  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months, launching multiple short-range missiles from south of Pyongyang that flew 350 kilometers toward the northeast and did not land in the sea. The test occurred just days before U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Asia, including planned meetings in South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia. Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi emphasized close coordination with U.S. and South Korean allies, sharing real-time missile warning data. Experts believe the test is a strategic move to assert North Korea’s nuclear capabilities ahead of the APEC summit, where Kim Jong Un may seek recognition as a nuclear weapons state to push for lifting of U.N. sanctions. North Korea previously displayed a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-20, at a military parade, signaling its growing military and diplomatic assertiveness. The Hwasong-20 is designed to carry multiple warheads and penetrate U.S. missile defenses, raising regional security concerns.",
