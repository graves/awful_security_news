  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a funding compact offering expanded federal grants to nine universities — including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown — in exchange for implementing ideological policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting specific biological definitions of gender. The compact also includes mandatory annual compliance polls and a five-year tuition freeze. As of October 20, 2025, seven institutions have formally rejected the proposal, citing concerns over academic freedom, merit-based research funding, and institutional sovereignty. Notably, universities like MIT, Dartmouth, and Penn emphasized that the agreement would undermine free inquiry and governance independence. The University of Texas at Austin has not rejected the offer, signaling a more open stance. The White House has set a target for initial signatories by November 21, 2025, and several schools remain under review or have not responded. This development reflects a broader political effort by the administration to exert ideological control over higher education institutions, which are central to cultural and intellectual life in the United States.",
