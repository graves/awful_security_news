  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is experiencing a major boardroom shake-up, with seven members — including chairman Helge Lund and vice chair Henrik Poulsen — stepping down in November. The resignations stem from a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, over governance reform. The foundation, which holds a controlling voting stake, advocated for a more extensive reconfiguration, rejecting the board’s proposal to bring in new members with fresh skills. This leadership turmoil follows prior changes such as the removal of former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen and a new CEO appointment, as well as staff layoffs and profit forecasts being cut due to rising competition, especially from Eli Lilly. Despite earlier peak valuation as Europe’s most-valued company driven by high demand for its weight-loss drugs, Novo Nordisk’s share price has declined amid ongoing market competition and governance tensions.",
