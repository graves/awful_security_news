  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the strategic and political significance of the 'yellow line'—a temporary military boundary in Gaza marking Israel’s control of about 53% of the territory—as a key component of Donald Trump’s peace plan. This line, described by an Israeli newspaper as 'effectively the new border,' has become a focal point of political tension between Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, which sees it as a potential foundation for settlement expansion, and U.S. allies who urge restraint to preserve the ceasefire. Despite Netanyahu’s insistence that war continues until Hamas is fully disarmed, Israel has maintained restraint after Hamas violations, choosing air strikes within the yellow line to avoid breaking the truce. The second stage of negotiations—centered on Hamas disarmament and power transfer—remains unresolved, creating a growing gap between domestic and foreign policy goals. The article highlights how the yellow line symbolizes both a compromise and a potential flashpoint, reflecting deeper divisions within Israel’s political coalition and the influence of U.S. diplomacy on Israeli military actions.",
