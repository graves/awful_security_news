    "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to become a hurricane, marking the first named storm in the Caribbean Sea this year.",

    "A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica.",
    "There is a low but non-zero chance Melissa could impact the mainland U.S., though it is more likely to affect Puerto Rico with rain and possible surf conditions along the East Coast.",
    "Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, increasing flood and mudslide risks due to mountainous terrain.",
    "Two main track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa moves north toward Hispaniola and strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday; the other where it moves west toward Central America, possibly impacting Nicaragua or Honduras.",
    "The Caribbean Sea has become extremely warm due to climate change, which is fueling storm development and contributing to rapid intensification of storms like Melissa, Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto this year.",
    "This year’s hurricane season includes three of four storms undergoing extreme rapid intensification, indicating a broader trend linked to global warming from fossil fuel pollution.",
    "Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, marking the first named storm in the Caribbean this year. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where heavy rainfall—potentially over a foot—could trigger dangerous flash floods and mudslides due to the region’s mountainous terrain. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct hit on the mainland U.S. is unlikely, some impacts such as rough surf and rip currents may affect the East Coast, with Florida being a possible secondary target. Two primary track scenarios are being monitored: one involving a northward turn toward Hispaniola and the other a westward path toward Central America. The storm’s development is being fueled by unusually warm Caribbean waters, which are increasingly common due to global warming and fossil fuel pollution. This trend is reflected in the rapid intensification of other recent storms, including Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. The article emphasizes the growing role of climate change in hurricane behavior and underscores the need for preparedness, especially in vulnerable regions.",
