  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million ballroom, a move that lacks approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal body responsible for overseeing major construction projects. Despite Trump’s claims that the ballroom is essential due to the East Room's limited capacity and that it will be privately funded by supporters and companies like Carrier Global Corp., the project raises serious legal and transparency concerns. The demolition, which began in September 2025, involves the removal of historic structures and offices, including those of the first lady. Carrier has donated HVAC systems, and Trump has stated that the project will cost zero to taxpayers. However, the absence of formal approval, ongoing government shutdown, and lack of public disclosure about donors highlight significant governance and accountability issues. The ballroom, expected to accommodate 999 guests, is scheduled for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029.",
