  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range strike weapon used in multiple conflicts, is being considered by Ukraine for deep strikes inside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly lobbied the US, particularly the Trump administration, for Tomahawk deliveries to target critical Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov. However, the US has limited stockpiles and has stated that Tomahawks are needed domestically, making delivery unlikely. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launcher (Typhon) to deploy them, and its own cruise missile, the Flamingo, remains unproven and underdeveloped. Russia has responded with alarm, viewing the supply of Tomahawks as a hostile act that could escalate the war and threaten global security. While Tomahawks offer greater destructive power than Ukrainian drones, Ukraine's most pressing need remains enhanced air defenses due to the increasing scale of Russian missile and drone attacks.",
