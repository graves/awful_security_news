  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon used in conflicts from Iraq to Syria, remains a strategic interest for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested the delivery of Tomahawks to strike deep within Russian territory—such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov—aiming to strengthen Ukraine’s position and force Russia to negotiate. However, the US has limited supply and prioritizes domestic needs, stating it has few Tomahawks left to spare. Ukraine lacks a ground-based launcher like the Typhon to operate the missiles, and its own Flamingo missile program remains uncertain and underdeveloped. Russia views the supply of Tomahawks as a hostile move that could trigger escalation, especially given the missile’s potential nuclear warhead capability. Despite these challenges, a few dozen Tomahawks could significantly damage Russian infrastructure, though Ukraine's most urgent need remains robust air defense to counter Russia’s drone and missile attacks.",
