  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Gabes, Tunisia, a general strike led by the UGTT has shut down major civic and economic institutions in response to widespread allegations that a state-run CGT phosphate plant—operational since 1972—has caused severe environmental and health crises. Residents report rising cases of gas poisoning, cancer, and marine life collapse due to emissions of phosphogypsum and radioactive waste. Despite a 2017 pledge to phase out the plant, authorities have instead increased production, citing economic necessity. The protests, which include mass rallies and chants like 'Gabes wants to live,' are seen as a major test of President Kais Saied’s authority since he seized emergency powers in 2021. Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination,' while activists and medical sources describe the situation as a systemic failure of environmental protection. In response, Chinese companies have been deployed to manage emissions, but public anger continues to grow over accountability and long-term solutions.",
