  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed plans for an imminent Trump-Putin summit, following Trump’s initial announcement of a meeting in Hungary within two weeks. The delay stems from a fundamental disagreement over ceasefire conditions: while Trump and Ukraine support freezing the current battle lines, Russia insists on retaining occupied territories and dismantling Ukrainian military capabilities. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was canceled after a phone call, signaling reduced need for in-person coordination. Russia maintains that its position has not changed since the Alaska summit, while the US and Ukraine criticize Moscow’s maximalist demands and stalling tactics. This delay deepens the diplomatic impasse and highlights ongoing tensions in peace negotiations.",
