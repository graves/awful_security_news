  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Guillermo del Toro’s new film *Frankenstein* is a deeply emotional and visually rich adaptation of Mary Shelley’s classic novel, reimagining the Creature as a sympathetically complex being who evolves from a rejected outcast into a deeply empathetic figure through reading and personal growth. The film diverges from the 1931 version starring Boris Karloff, which emphasized physical horror and emotional flatness, by focusing on the Creature’s intellectual and emotional journey, embodied by Jacob Elordi. Del Toro’s version includes narrative changes — such as a subplot involving young Frankenstein, Victor’s harsh relationship with his father, and the introduction of characters like Christoph Waltz’s Harlander and Mia Goth’s Elizabeth — to deepen the emotional stakes and explore themes of hubris, empathy, and creation. While some changes are seen as unnecessary or overcomplicated, the film aligns with del Toro’s lifelong artistic vision of portraying outcasts as heroes, emphasizing emotional resonance over literal fidelity to the original text.",
