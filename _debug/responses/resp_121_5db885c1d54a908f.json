  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major outage beginning at 3:11 a.m. Eastern time on October 20, 2025, affecting 64 of its internal services in the US-EAST-1 region. The root cause was identified as a failure in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which disrupted internet access for a wide range of services, including social media platforms like Snapchat and Roblox, gaming apps such as Fortnite, financial services like Robinhood and Coinbase, streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, and educational platforms such as Canvas. The outage also impacted Amazon’s own products, including Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa smart speakers. Educational institutions, including the University of California, Riverside, and Ohio State University, reported that students could not access course materials or submit assignments. Recovery was completed by 6 p.m. Eastern time, though the process was described as slow and bumpy. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages are common and typically resolve within hours, and are likely due to technical issues, not cyberattacks. This incident underscores the fragility of modern internet infrastructure, which increasingly relies on a small number of companies like Amazon for critical cloud computing services.",
