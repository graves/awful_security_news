A lifelong fan of heavy metal, she brings an energetic, unconventional personality to politics, symbolized by her short 'Sanae cut' hairstyle and her dedication to traditionalist and nationalist policies. As a member of the ultranationalist group Nippon Kaigi, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and increasing defense spending, aligning with her mentor Shinzo Abe and potentially with U.S. President Donald Trump. Her leadership faces significant challenges, including Japan’s shrinking workforce, rising inflation, economic stagnation, and strained trade relations—especially with the U.S. over a $550 billion investment deal. Her controversial stances on China, including remarks about foreign visitors and visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, risk straining diplomatic ties, though analysts expect moderation. Her record on gender equality is mixed, as she opposes women keeping separate surnames and female succession in the imperial family, though she has proposed supportive childcare policies. Despite internal party scandals, Takaichi’s rise signals a shift in Japan’s political culture and offers both hope and uncertainty for the future of Japanese governance.",
