  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator who rose from political obscurity, won Bolivia’s presidential election with 54% of the vote, defeating former President Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, who received 45%. The victory marks a significant shift away from two decades of Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) rule, driven by public anger over economic collapse, inflation, and the perceived mismanagement of public resources. Paz’s campaign, backed by his running mate Edman Lara — a former police officer known for anti-corruption activism — resonated with working-class and Indigenous voters, especially in the Andean highlands. However, the new government faces immense challenges, including a severe dollar shortage, fuel shortages, and a 23% inflation rate. Paz has pledged to end the fixed exchange rate, cut fuel subsidies, and reduce public spending, while avoiding the IMF and promising gradual reforms. Though he aims to maintain social benefits, his vague promises of financial support have drawn criticism. The election reflects a deep class divide, with Paz winning among rural and Indigenous communities and Quiroga among wealthier, politically entrenched elites in Santa Cruz. This shift signals a potential turning point in Bolivia’s economic and political trajectory, though the success of reforms remains uncertain.",
