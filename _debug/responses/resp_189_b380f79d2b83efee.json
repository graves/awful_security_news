  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the rising threat of unauthorized and hostile drone activity across Europe, particularly near critical infrastructure and civilian areas. It highlights how anti-drone technologies such as radio frequency jamming (used by MyDefence), acoustic and optical detection, and low-cost interceptors (developed by Nordic Air Defence) are being deployed. While jamming is effective against 80–90% of drones, detecting small or stealthy drones remains difficult. The war in Ukraine has driven innovation in both drone use and defense, emphasizing the need for affordable, scalable, and safe countermeasures. Civilian applications in shipping, oil, and law enforcement are growing, but shooting down drones poses risks of physical damage. A proposed solution—drone traffic management with electronic license plates and flight registration—aims to improve identification and reduce false alarms, enabling safer, more controlled responses.",
