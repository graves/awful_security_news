  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite not securing approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which governs major renovations in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump, who announced the project in July 2025, claims the ballroom is a long-desired addition and that it will not interfere with the main building, with all costs being privately funded. The project has faced scrutiny over procedural violations and legal jurisdiction, as the NCPC has not reviewed or approved the plans. Site preparation began in September, with demolition visible in October 2025. The East Wing offices, including those of the First Lady, will be temporarily relocated. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an energy-efficient HVAC system. The ballroom is expected to be completed before Trump's term ends in January 2029, and the White House has not yet disclosed the identities of financial contributors.",
