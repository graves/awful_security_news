  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors from the Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s eligibility to serve as James Comey’s defense attorney, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified material in 2017. The government cites quarantined communications between the two, claiming the memoranda were initially unclassified but later upclassified. Fitzgerald counters that the memos were unclassified at the time of sharing and that the Justice Department’s inspector general found no evidence of leaked classified information. Comey’s team rejects the claims, asserting that upclassification does not alter the original classification status. Legal experts highlight ethical conflicts where a lawyer cannot simultaneously be a witness and represent a client in the same case, raising significant concerns about the fairness and integrity of the legal representation.",
