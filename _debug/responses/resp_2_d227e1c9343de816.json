  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided over the war in Gaza. Celebrities like Debra Messing, Mark Ruffalo, and Cynthia Nixon have been vocal in their support for Palestinian causes, while others like Javier Bardem have led a boycott of Israeli film institutions citing institutional complicity in Palestinian suffering. Critics argue that the activism is not about peace but about political attacks on Israel. Major studios, including Paramount and Warner Bros., have publicly opposed the boycott, fearing censorship and the erosion of creative freedom. The conflict has led to real-world consequences such as stars being dropped and studios facing internal divisions. As the ceasefire’s durability is uncertain, the role of celebrities in shaping public discourse and policy remains a central issue in global politics and cultural influence.",
