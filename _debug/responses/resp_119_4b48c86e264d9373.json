  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A remnant of Typhoon Halong struck Western Alaska on October 11, 2025, causing hurricane-force winds and record flooding in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, particularly in the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok. Over 1,000 people were displaced, with one woman dead and two family members missing. The storm shifted unexpectedly just one day and a half before landfall, leaving little time for evacuation. Remote infrastructure, including damaged runways and fragile foundations built on unstable permafrost, worsened response times. Evacuees were initially sheltered in schools and then moved to Bethel, which quickly reached capacity, before being flown to Anchorage. Many residents, especially Yup'ik people, face deep emotional and cultural challenges in leaving their ancestral homelands due to ties to subsistence hunting and traditional land use. The region has previously suffered from climate-related flooding, with a prior federal disaster declaration issued in August 2024. Climate specialists attribute the region’s vulnerability to thawing permafrost, erosion, and low elevation tundra, indicating a growing crisis tied to global climate change.",
