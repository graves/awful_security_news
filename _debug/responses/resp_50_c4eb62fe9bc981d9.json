Health officials say the risk to the public remains low, and no confirmed person-to-person transmission has been found. Both individuals were hospitalized and are recovering at home. Experts, including Dr. William Schaffner, express concern over possible community spread, especially given that prior U.S. cases were linked to international travel. The situation is being monitored closely, but public health response is weakened by a federal government shutdown and CDC staff layoffs, which may reduce the capacity for timely and effective intervention.",
