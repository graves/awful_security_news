  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, an Ecuadorean national, after the US military conducted a strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean allegedly used to transport drugs, including fentanyl. The vessel, reportedly built for drug smuggling, was attacked by US forces, killing two men and leaving two survivors—Tufiño and Colombian citizen Jeison Obando Pérez—rescued and repatriated. While the US government claims the vessel was carrying 'narco-terrorists' and that the operation targets drug trafficking from Venezuela under the leadership of Nicolás Maduro, critics argue the attacks breach international law and violate territorial sovereignty, especially in cases like the one involving Colombia. Colombia and Ecuador have expressed concerns about the legality and human cost of the operations, while the US has defended its actions and increased military presence, including deploying around 10,000 troops. The incident has sparked diplomatic friction, with Colombia accusing the US of murder and Venezuela’s Maduro denying drug trafficking allegations, while US officials continue to assert the operation is a necessary counter-narcotics effort.",
