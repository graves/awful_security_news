The Blue Jays, who have not won a pennant in over three decades, advanced to the World Series, where they will face the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Mariners' season-high three errors—two in the second inning—led to early runs, but they were unable to recover, with a wild pitch from Matt Brash sealing the game.
