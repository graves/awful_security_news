  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration has the legal authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, in response to protests over immigration policies, overturning a prior district court decision. However, the decision does not permit immediate deployment due to an ongoing second restraining order. The ruling is supported by two Trump-appointed judges, but opposed by a third judge, Susan P. Graber, who argues it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The deployment in Portland has sparked fierce backlash from Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek, who calls for a full en banc review. Similar federalization efforts are underway in San Francisco, Chicago, and Memphis, all facing legal challenges from state officials and residents. The administration has invoked the Insurrection Act, citing threats to federal personnel, though critics argue the protests are not as violent as claimed. A bipartisan group of senators has requested a Defense Department inquiry into the broader impacts of these deployments on military readiness and civil liberties, highlighting growing national concern over the use of federal military forces in domestic civil unrest.",
