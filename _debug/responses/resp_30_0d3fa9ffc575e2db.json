  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS reported a network connection system outage on October 21, 2025, that prevented some of its pharmacies from filling or delivering prescriptions, leading to customer frustration and social media complaints. The company confirmed the issue and apologized, stating that service was restored. The incident coincided with a major AWS outage the previous day, drawing attention to how society’s dependence on cloud-based systems—critical for healthcare, banking, and daily services—makes it vulnerable to large-scale technical failures. While CVS’s outage is a localized issue, it is part of a broader pattern of systemic fragility in digital infrastructure.",
