  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing more smoothly than expected, according to US Vice-President JD Vance, who visited Israel to reinforce the truce. Despite a recent Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli airstrikes killing dozens of Palestinians, both sides have expressed commitment to the agreement. Hamas has returned the body of Israeli hostage Tal Haimi, bringing the total of returned deceased hostages to 13 out of 28, though Israel insists on full compliance. The US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are pushing for negotiations on the next phase of the peace plan, which includes an interim Palestinian government, disarmament of Hamas, and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Meanwhile, the UN World Food Programme reports that only two aid crossings—Kerem Shalom and Kissufim—are operational, with severe food shortages in northern Gaza due to limited access. The situation underscores the fragile balance between military enforcement and humanitarian needs, with both Israel and Hamas facing significant political and operational challenges to maintain the ceasefire and achieve lasting peace.",
