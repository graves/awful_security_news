    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza, established under Donald Trump's peace plan, marks a temporary Israeli military withdrawal to about 53% control of the Gaza Strip.",
    "The yellow line is seen by Israeli media as 'effectively the new border' and is politically significant for Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners.",
    "Netanyahu's government faces pressure from U.S. officials to maintain restraint, especially after Hamas allegedly violated ceasefire terms by killing two soldiers.",
    "Israeli actions, such as limited airstrikes and emphasizing attacks inside the yellow line, are intended to demonstrate compliance with ceasefire rules to maintain U.S. support.",
    "Netanyahu maintains that war will not end until Hamas is dismantled and Gaza is fully disarmed, but Israeli commentators suggest that U.S. influence is increasingly shaping military decisions.",
    "The yellow line may become a de facto border if negotiations in the second stage fail, potentially enabling new settlements and even annexation of Gaza by hardline factions.",
    "A majority of Israelis support ending the war and bringing hostages and soldiers home, but Netanyahu's strategy prioritizes long-term political flexibility.",
    "The second stage of the Trump deal hinges on resolving issues like power transfer in Gaza and Hamas disarmament, which remain unresolved and politically delicate.",
    "U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, have urged Netanyahu to show restraint, signaling Washington's preference for stability over escalation.",
    "Netanyahu's coalition partners, especially far-right figures, are cautious about pushing further, fearing that unresolved issues may solidify the yellow line as a permanent border."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn to a 'yellow line' marking about 53% control of the Gaza Strip, which Israeli media have labeled as 'effectively the new border.' This development satisfies Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, who see it as a strategic gain. However, the move has created tension between Netanyahu’s domestic allies and U.S. officials, who urge restraint after Hamas allegedly violated the ceasefire by killing soldiers. Israel responded with limited airstrikes, emphasizing attacks within the yellow line to avoid breaking the truce. Netanyahu maintains that war will continue until Hamas is fully disarmed, but Israeli commentators suggest that U.S. influence is increasingly shaping military decisions. The yellow line could become permanent if the second stage of negotiations fails, potentially enabling new settlements or even annexation of Gaza. The article underscores a political and diplomatic struggle: Netanyahu must balance pressure from domestic hardliners and U.S. diplomacy to prevent escalation while preserving the fragile ceasefire.",
