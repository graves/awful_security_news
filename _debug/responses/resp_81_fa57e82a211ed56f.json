  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A widespread cultural trend in 2025 sees cowboys — symbolizing rugged individualism, patriotism, and traditional American values — appear across fashion, advertising, television, and politics. The phenomenon is linked to conservative political movements, including the Trump administration, which uses cowboy imagery to promote a vision of the 'common man' and rural strength. This resurgence echoes historical cycles, beginning with the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows in the 1880s and reinforced by Western films and patriotic sentiment during the Cold War era. However, the popular image of the cowboy is largely mythological, ignoring the real history of Mexican, Native, and enslaved Black Americans who were central to the actual development of cowboy culture. While recent efforts by artists like Gabriela Hasbun and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' campaign have begun to highlight Black cowboy communities and their contributions, mainstream media and politics continue to 'whitewash' these narratives, prioritizing a romantic, idealized version of the West. This cycle of mythologizing and commercialization reflects broader cultural and political trends, showing how American identity is shaped by selective, often nostalgic, imagery.",
