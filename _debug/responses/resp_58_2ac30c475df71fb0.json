    "Brett James, a Grammy-winning songwriter known for collaborations with Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, in Franklin, North Carolina.",
    "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the plane entered a 'tightening spiral' due to a radio communication failure, with James failing to tune to the common traffic advisory frequency despite being instructed to do so.",
