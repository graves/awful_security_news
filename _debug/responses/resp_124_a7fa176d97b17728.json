  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals, up from 376 in the prior year, marking a slow but encouraging recovery after a 25% population decline from 2010 to 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium and NOAA attribute this progress to improved conservation measures, including new protections in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence and reduced whale injuries. Despite only 11 calves being born in the latest year, the emergence of four new births and shorter calving intervals among established mothers signals improved reproductive health. Experts remain cautious, noting that the species still faces significant threats from ship strikes and fishing gear, and that long-term survival depends on sustained conservation and political support for laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act.",
