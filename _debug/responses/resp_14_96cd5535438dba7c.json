  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes the evolving relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, noting a significant improvement in diplomatic ties. While Trump initially threatened to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, a potential escalatory move, he later emphasized a ceasefire at current battle lines, which could benefit Kyiv. Despite this, the real prize—lasting peace—remains out of reach. The article highlights Ukraine's military resilience, particularly in holding key towns like Pokrovsk, Kupiansk, and Kostyantynivka, and underscores that Russian advances have failed to achieve strategic goals. Trump’s recognition of being played by Putin and his shift toward military pressure reflect a new strategic posture. Additionally, Ukraine is now promoting its drone technology to NATO allies, and global pressure—especially from India and economic strain in Russia—is undermining Russian military momentum. Overall, while a peace deal remains distant, the battlefield dynamics are shifting in Ukraine’s favor, driven by effective drone warfare and resilient defense.",
