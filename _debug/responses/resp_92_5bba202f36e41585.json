  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which its Domain Name System (DNS) failed to communicate with customer databases, including those hosted in DynamoDB and other services like EC2. This caused millions of users worldwide to lose access to critical online services such as banking, shopping, social media, and airline bookings. The outage lasted several hours, with services restored by 6:35 AM ET. Experts attribute the event to a likely technical fault in AWS’s DNS infrastructure, not a cyberattack, and highlight that the incident reflects a broader systemic issue: the internet's increasing dependence on a small number of centralized cloud providers, making it vulnerable to cascading failures. Historical outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software failure and AT&T’s network meltdown, demonstrate that such disruptions are not isolated events and carry major economic and societal consequences.",
