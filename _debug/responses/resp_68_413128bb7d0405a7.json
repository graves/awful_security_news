  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, essential federal workers — including those at the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Internal Revenue Service — are facing unprecedented pressure to remain on duty. Workers are being told that taking medical or vacation leave during the shutdown would be treated as 'disciplinary and adverse action,' a designation that has never been applied before and could damage their employment records. Conflicting guidance from supervisors has left employees confused and anxious, with many choosing to cancel planned procedures or delay medical care to avoid job risk. The Trump administration has issued over 4,100 reductions in force notices and is challenging a 2019 law that ensures retroactive pay for furloughed workers, heightening concerns about job stability and fair treatment. Experts and union leaders argue that treating furloughs as disciplinary actions is a violation of precedent and adds a layer of mistreatment on top of existing workplace stress, making the shutdown not just a fiscal issue, but a serious threat to employee well-being and civil rights.",
