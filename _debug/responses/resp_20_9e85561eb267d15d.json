    "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver is facing a three-count indictment alleging interference with ICE officers during a May 2025 oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey.",
    "Her defense claims the prosecution is politically motivated and retaliatory, citing a broader partisan agenda against 'wokeness' and contrasting it with President Trump's pardons of January 6 Capitol rioters.",
    "Judge Jamel Semper has ordered DHS to remove social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa activity was involved, calling such posts prejudicial to a fair jury pool.",
    "The incident involved McIver attempting to intervene in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was forcibly removed from the facility and later arrested for trespassing (a charge later dropped).",
    "McIver’s attorneys argue her actions were part of official legislative oversight and protected under the Speech or Debate Clause, while prosecutors rely on surveillance and body-worn camera footage to support their claims.",
    "Other Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Rob Menendez, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Ilhan Omar, Jasmine Crockett, and Sara Jacobs, were present at the hearing and expressed solidarity with McIver.",
    "President Donald Trump has publicly criticized McIver, stating the 'days of woke are over,' aligning with the political controversy surrounding her prosecution.",
    "A key discrepancy in the case is that while McIver was charged, other Democratic lawmakers involved were not, leading to claims of selective prosecution and political bias."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 2025 oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. The incident involved her attempt to intervene in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was forcibly removed and later arrested for trespassing (a charge later dropped). Prosecutors claim she physically assaulted ICE agents, while McIver’s defense argues her actions were part of legitimate legislative oversight protected under the Speech or Debate Clause. The case is being seen as politically charged, with McIver’s attorneys claiming it is retaliatory and driven by a broader partisan agenda targeting 'wokeness,' contrasting it with President Donald Trump’s pardons of Capitol rioters. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa was involved are prejudicial and ordered their removal. The case is scheduled to go to trial on November 10, 2025, with both sides relying heavily on surveillance footage. Other Democratic lawmakers, including Menendez, Watson Coleman, Omar, Crockett, and Jacobs, have publicly supported McIver, emphasizing political solidarity and concern over selective prosecution.",
