  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article from NPR, co-authored by Kat McGowan and Connie Hanzhang Jin, offers a caregiver’s survival guide based on real experiences from nearly 600 individuals who shared their stories. It breaks down caregiving into key themes: navigating the U.S. healthcare system, adjusting to a new life reality, seeking external support, practicing essential self-care, and managing evolving relationships. The core message is that caregiving is a marathon, not a sprint, and that asking for help and maintaining personal well-being are not signs of weakness but essential components of sustainable care.",
