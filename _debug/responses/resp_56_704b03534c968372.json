  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite his recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rejected the idea as damaging to U.S.-Russia relations. While the U.S. administration has prepared plans to deliver the weapons, Trump is not expected to commit to them during his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, although he retains the authority to do so at any time. Zelensky and Ukrainian officials see the missiles as a potential game-changer that could force Russia to the negotiating table. Putin argues that the missiles would not affect the battlefield but would significantly strain diplomatic relations, especially due to their range covering major Russian cities. The potential deployment is framed as leverage in Trump’s broader diplomatic strategy to end the war, not as an immediate escalation. The article highlights the evolving dynamics of U.S.-Russia-Ukraine diplomacy, with key developments occurring just before Trump’s White House meeting with Zelensky.",
