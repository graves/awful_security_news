  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, California, on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, a 155mm artillery shell fired by an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate highway, sending shrapnel that damaged a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The incident, which occurred after a 70-year gap since similar firing over I-5, raised safety concerns despite officials stating the trajectory was safe. No injuries were reported, but the event sparked a public dispute between Governor Gavin Newsom and White House officials, with Newsom calling the practice 'dangerous.' The military has initiated an investigation into the cause of the premature explosion, which may stem from issues in the shell’s manufacturing or explosive composition. Background includes a significant increase in U.S. artillery production since 2022, driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia, and a 2024 Reuters report highlighting past manufacturing problems, including cracked shells and a shift from TNT to a less-stable explosive, later reversed for production efficiency.",
