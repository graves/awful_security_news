  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, convicted of aggravated identity theft and wire fraud for fabricating parts of his biography during his 2022 congressional campaign, was released from prison on October 18, 2025, after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence. Santos, who had been expelled from Congress in December 2023, had been serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, and had spent significant time in solitary confinement. In a public letter, Santos pleaded for fairness and acknowledged responsibility for his actions. The commutation drew praise from political allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Matt Gaetz, who supported him throughout. However, it also drew criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued that Trump should have addressed the healthcare crisis during the government shutdown instead. The case highlights tensions between executive clemency, political loyalty, and the accountability of public officials.",
