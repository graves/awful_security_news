  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Colombian appeals court has overturned the 2025 conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe for fraud and bribery, citing structural flaws in the original judgment. The decision, which reversed a July 2025 conviction by Judge Sandra Liliana Heredia, has reignited political controversy, with critics accusing the judiciary of enabling right-wing paramilitary abuses. The case is deeply tied to Colombia’s long-standing conflict and political polarization, and its outcome is expected to heavily influence the 2026 presidential election. Key figures such as President Gustavo Petro and Senator Ivan Cepeda are actively engaged, with Cepeda planning to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision has also drawn international attention, especially from U.S. political figures like Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who have criticized Latin American judicial systems as biased against conservative leaders. As the case continues through the judicial system, it remains a pivotal moment in Colombia’s political history and a symbol of broader tensions between justice, power, and historical accountability.",
