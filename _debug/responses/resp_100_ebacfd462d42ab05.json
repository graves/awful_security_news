  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian organizations, banning the UNRWA agency from operating in Gaza and requiring all major non-governmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under new ideological criteria. These criteria, enforced by COGAT, include disqualifications for organizations deemed to support 'terrorist activities' or 'incite racism,' leading to the de-registration of key groups such as the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, Israel continues to limit crossings, with only two of seven border crossings open. Aid groups report that hundreds of trucks are waiting in Egypt and Jordan, and that most requests to enter Gaza are denied without explanation. Humanitarian officials warn that this policy threatens to cause a full-scale famine and collapse of essential services in Gaza, where over 90% of homes have been destroyed. The U.S. and EU have reduced funding to UNRWA, further undermining its ability to provide life-saving aid.",
