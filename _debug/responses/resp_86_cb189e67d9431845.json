  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a dramatic escalation of diplomatic tensions, President Donald Trump announced the immediate termination of all U.S. financial payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to curb drug production. This move follows months of conflict over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean, where the U.S. has conducted several operations targeting vessels believed to carry narcotics. Colombia, the world’s top cocaine producer, has long been a key U.S. ally in security and defense, receiving around $210 million in annual aid. Trump warned Petro he would 'close up these killing fields' or face similar action, while Petro responded by criticizing Trump’s characterizations, invoking Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez and his novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' to highlight ideological and cultural differences. The situation reflects a broader clash between U.S. military interventionism and Colombian leadership's socialist, human-centered approach to governance and national development.",
