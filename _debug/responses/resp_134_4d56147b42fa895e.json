  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed escalation of US-China trade tensions, with President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in direct response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its measures as a national security response to US trade restrictions and targeting of Chinese industries. The dispute, which includes history of tariff escalations from 2018 to 2025, reflects a broader strategic competition over technological dominance, especially in semiconductors and rare earths. Experts argue that both nations are engaging in calculated, high-stakes posturing, with China appearing more strategic and the US relying on leverage and broad economic tools. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea has been clouded by these actions, raising concerns about the stability of global trade and the potential for a full-scale trade war. The article underscores how the conflict is not merely economic but deeply rooted in national security and technological supremacy, with both sides using export controls, tariffs, and diplomatic threats to gain advantage.",
