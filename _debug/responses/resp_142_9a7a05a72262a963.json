  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a rising trade conflict between the United States and China, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China retaliating with export controls on rare-earth minerals. This escalation follows a history of tit-for-tat tariffs and economic restrictions, including U.S. actions targeting Huawei, TikTok, and advanced semiconductors, and China's response through national security-based export controls. Experts suggest both nations are using economic tools strategically, with China demonstrating early strategic foresight in defining national security, while the U.S. appears to be calibrating pressure to avoid market shocks. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is under threat due to the escalating tensions, and analysts believe neither side will back down, leading to a protracted standoff that may depend more on global market reactions than diplomatic outcomes.",
