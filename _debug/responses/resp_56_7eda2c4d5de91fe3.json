  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the product’s safety label that would warn about a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that such use poses a risk, the FDA and major medical organizations—including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists—state that no causal relationship has been proven. Scientific studies, including one analyzing over 2 million children, show no significant associations between acetaminophen and autism or ADHD. International regulators in the EU, UK, and Canada affirm the safety of the medication during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that proposed label changes are unsupported by evidence and would contradict long-standing FDA positions. The article highlights the tension between political statements and scientific consensus on a widely used and well-studied medication.",
