  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This marks a significant disruption in government operations, echoing the longest shutdown in nearly 50 years â€” the 35-day partial shutdown from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, which cost the nation an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected approximately 800,000 federal employees. The article highlights that political partisanship, particularly in the current session with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson leading a narrow House majority and lacking the 60 votes to break a Senate filibuster, has made bipartisan funding agreements difficult. This ongoing shutdown reflects a broader legislative stalemate, with federal agencies either fully shut down or operating under furloughs, and underscores the economic and societal consequences of prolonged government inactivity.",
