  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Pediatrics finds that reversing decades of advice against early peanut exposure — based on the landmark LEAP study — has significantly reduced the prevalence of peanut allergies in U.S. children. Since the 2015 update in health guidelines, including recommendations from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, peanut allergy rates have dropped by 43%, with a 36% decrease in overall food allergies. The study, led by Dr. David Hill of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, analyzed health records from over 120,000 children and found that early introduction of peanuts, especially in high-risk infants, prevents allergies. The reversal was prompted by evidence that Israeli children, who were routinely exposed to peanut snacks like Bamba, had much lower allergy rates than British children, who avoided peanuts. Despite the strong evidence, implementation remains inconsistent due to parental fears and data limitations, such as reliance on diagnostic codes. Experts note that peanut allergies are often lifelong, with only about 10% of affected children outgrowing them, making preventive measures especially valuable.",
