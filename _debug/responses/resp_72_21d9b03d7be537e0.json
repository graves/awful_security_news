The decision to cancel the match was based on the 'endangerment of human life' following fans throwing pyrotechnics and smoke grenades. Hapoel criticized the police response, accusing them of preparing for a 'war' rather than a sporting event, while Maccabi remained silent. This incident follows previous violence involving Maccabi fans abroad, such as in England and Amsterdam, which led to security bans and political controversy. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the English ban on Maccabi fans, emphasizing the need for inclusive and safe fan participation in sports, and expressed willingness to collaborate with Israeli authorities to understand the events in Tel Aviv.",
