  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central projects that climate change will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100, even under current climate commitments — half the increase from the pre-Paris 4°C warming scenario. The Paris Climate Agreement has reduced warming from 4°C to 2.6°C, preventing an even worse outcome of 114 extra superhot days. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 such days on average. The study reveals a stark climate injustice: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa — which emit only 1% of global carbon — will face dramatic increases in dangerous heat (up to 149 extra days), while major emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequalities and fuel geopolitical instability, underscoring the urgent need for climate justice and more equitable policy action.",
