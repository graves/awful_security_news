  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to determine how to vote, citing that these models provide a 'highly distorted and polarised view' of politics. Tests conducted in the run-up to the October 29 parliamentary elections revealed that AI models frequently recommended fringe parties like the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left-Labour Party, while largely ignoring centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The watchdog emphasizes that AI systems lack transparency, verifiability, and reliability in political advice, and urges both voters and chatbot providers to avoid using AI for voting decisions, as such use threatens the integrity of democratic elections. This comes amid political instability caused by the PVV's withdrawal from the coalition government over immigration policy, making the issue of trustworthy political information especially urgent.",
