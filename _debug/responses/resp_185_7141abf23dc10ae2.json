  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is undergoing a major boardroom reshuffle as seven members, including chairman Helge Lund and vice-chairman Henrik Poulsen, are stepping down due to a governance conflict with its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The foundation, which holds a controlling 75% voting interest despite owning only 28.1% of shares, pushed for a broader reconfiguration of the board, rejecting the board's proposal to add new members with specific skills. This leadership shift follows recent financial challenges, including layoffs of 9,000 employees, declining profit forecasts, and a 1.7% drop in share price after the announcement. The foundation's current chairman, Lars Rebien Sorensen, is being proposed as the new chairman, citing the company's historical failure to adapt to market changes such as the rise of off-label weight-loss use and competition from rivals like Eli Lilly.",
