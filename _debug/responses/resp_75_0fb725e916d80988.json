  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively scrutinizing the federal government's response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that resulted in over 1,000 arrests. She expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras on federal agents during protests, citing concerns about the use of tear gas and pepper balls without warning, notably after a pastor reported being struck multiple times. While CBP agents are equipped with cameras and trained in crowd control, ICE Special Response Teams lack body cameras and have been criticized for inconsistent enforcement. Federal leadership has been described as unstable, with key officials like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino leaving the field. The Trump administration denies media reports of force without warning, while internal reviews are conducted to assess compliance. Judge Ellis plans to continue deposing top officials to ensure transparency and accountability in federal law enforcement actions.",
