This visit comes amid growing private worries within the Trump administration that the ceasefire could collapse, especially after an attack that killed two Israeli soldiers led to retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza. US officials, including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are actively involved in reinforcing the agreement, with Witkoff urging proportionate responses to violence and emphasizing the next 30 days as critical. While both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violations, they reaffirmed their commitment to the truce. President Donald Trump privately believes the attack was part of internal Hamas ‘rebellion’ and has threatened to ‘eradicate’ Hamas if necessary, while maintaining that there is still hope for compliance. Israeli officials are pushing the US to take stronger action to demilitarize Hamas before moving to reconstruction talks.",
