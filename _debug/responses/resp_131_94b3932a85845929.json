  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman, Shannon Keeler, at Gettysburg College in 2013. After years of silence, Keeler pursued charges, which were initially delayed due to institutional reluctance to prosecute campus sexual assaults. Her public advocacy in 2021 — including an Associated Press story — helped prompt renewed legal action. Cleary was extradited from France in 2024 after being detained on a vagrancy charge, and in 2025, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Senior Judge Kevin Hess, who considered his remorse and mental health history. The case highlights systemic failures in campus sexual assault prosecution, the long-term trauma of victims, and the role of public awareness in achieving justice after years of inaction.",
