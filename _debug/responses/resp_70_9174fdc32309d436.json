  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a federal funding compact for select universities, offering expanded grants and access to White House events in exchange for ideological policy changes, including removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and enforcing gender definitions based on biology. Seven of nine universities—MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and the University of Arizona—have formally rejected the proposal, citing serious threats to academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding. The White House claims the compact promotes a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and offers competitive advantages, but universities argue it undermines free inquiry and academic excellence. The proposal has sparked widespread resistance, with schools emphasizing their right to self-governance and independence, and with concerns that federal control over higher education could erode democratic values and innovation. The deadline for initial signatories is set for November 21, 2025.",
