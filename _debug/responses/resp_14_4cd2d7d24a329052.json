  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In a recent hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to activate body-worn cameras, citing concerns that agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls without warning. CBP agents are required to use cameras, but ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued them and must seek congressional approval. ICE agents have received training in crowd control and media handling, yet a reported incident in Albany Park involving Pastor David Black, who was struck with pepper balls without warning, raised serious concerns. Federal leadership has also been described as a 'revolving door,' with key officials like Russell Hott leaving the Chicago area. The Trump administration has denied reports of tear gas use without warning, asserting media bias. Judge Ellis plans to continue questioning top officials, including Hott and Bovino, to determine accountability and compliance with her order.",
