  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six major universities — including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for significant policy changes. The compact, sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, demands that universities eliminate considerations of sex and ethnicity in admissions, cap international enrollment at 15%, freeze tuition for five years, and adopt gender definitions based on biological processes. The White House claims such reforms would promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and provide preferential access to grants and federal events. However, university leaders argue that the proposal undermines academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition, with several citing threats to free inquiry and governance independence. While some schools like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, others, including Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, are still reviewing the offer. The controversy highlights a broader political struggle over federal influence in higher education, where universities are defending their independence amid growing ideological pressure from the Trump administration.",
