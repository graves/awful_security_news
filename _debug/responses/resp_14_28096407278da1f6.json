  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement campaign in Chicago that led to over 1,000 migrant arrests and widespread protests. In a recent hearing, she expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents on the ground to wear body-worn cameras during protests to ensure transparency and prevent unannounced use of force. While CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued them and must seek congressional approval. The judge questioned officials on training, incident reporting, and specific cases, including one in which Pastor David Black said he was struck multiple times with pepper balls without warning while praying. Federal leadership has been described as unstable, with frequent turnover, and the administration has denied media reports of tear gas use without warning. Judge Ellis plans to continue deposing key officials, including Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino, to obtain firsthand accounts of on-the-ground operations during the protests.",
