  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A close election in Canada’s Terrebonne district, won by just one vote, has sparked a legal challenge after a voter, Emmanuelle Bossé, reported her mail-in ballot was not counted due to an administrative error—specifically, a mistakenly printed postal code on ballots by Elections Canada. The case is now being heard in Quebec’s Superior Court, with both candidates' legal teams arguing over the legitimacy of the result: the Bloc Québécois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné claims overturning the result is necessary to maintain public trust, while the Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste’s legal team argues that invalidating the result denies the right to vote. The incident raises broader concerns about the integrity of electoral systems, especially in extremely narrow races, and highlights the tension between procedural errors and democratic legitimacy.",
