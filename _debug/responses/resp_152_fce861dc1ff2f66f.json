  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made claims in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, attributing it to the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol). Experts, including autism scientist Helen Tager-Flusberg, have refuted these claims, noting that neither the 2013 nor the 2015 studies establishing such a link are robust or causal. The 2013 study found only a correlation across countries, with no data on acetaminophen use, and the 2015 Danish study had tiny sample sizes and significant methodological limitations. A 2025 preprint from WPLab, which has not been peer-reviewed, promotes a causal link between acetaminophen and autism and is cited by Kennedy. WPLab’s CEO William Parker has a history of contact with Kennedy, raising concerns about influence. The scientific consensus remains that acetaminophen is safe and no evidence supports a link to autism.",
