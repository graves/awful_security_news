    "Internal factionalism and ideological purity tests remain significant challenges, including the de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2024 over issues of antisemitism and Zionism, and ongoing debates about the DSA’s stance on Israel and Palestinian liberation.",
    "The DSA’s central role in the Palestinian cause, especially following the Hamas-Israel ceasefire in October 2025, has become a defining identity feature, both attracting supporters and alienating others who value political neutrality.",
    "Other progressive candidates, such as Omar Fateh in Minneapolis and Katie Wilson in Seattle, are leveraging the DSA’s energy and grassroots mobilization tactics to challenge incumbent officials, signaling a broader shift in progressive politics.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the June 2025 New York City Democratic primary marks the largest electoral success for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a major shift in American politics. The DSA, which advocates for systemic change such as government ownership, single-payer healthcare, abolition of policing, and rent control, has seen a dramatic membership surge—reaching 80,000 members nationally—with a 11,000-member New York City chapter. This growth is fueled by widespread public frustration with corporate power, the Democratic Party establishment, and the failure to address issues like affordability and inequality. While the DSA’s strong stance on Palestinian liberation and anti-imperialism has energized many, it has also sparked internal debates and factionalism, including the de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Other candidates like Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson are now following Mamdani’s model, using grassroots organizing and socialist messaging to challenge traditional power structures. A Gallup poll from September 2025 shows that 66% of Democrats view socialism positively, highlighting a broader political realignment toward progressive, democratic socialist ideals.",
