His dismissal follows a dismal start to the season, including a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, with no wins in nine matches and only two draws. The club, which had just seen Nuno Espírito Santo fired after a strong season, now faces its third managerial change in the season, highlighting instability in leadership. The decision is notable not only for its brevity but also for the public backlash, with fans booing Postecoglou at the final match. The situation echoes past managerial records, with Sam Allardyce being the only permanent manager with a shorter tenure, and sets a new benchmark for managerial performance expectations in the Premier League.",
