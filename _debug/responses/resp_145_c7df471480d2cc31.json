  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Pakistan’s climate-vulnerable mountain regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like heavy rainfall, animal behavior, and loud sounds—is being used by local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to detect and warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), saving lives when government early warning systems fail. Despite significant investments, including a $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are widely seen as ineffective due to malfunctioning equipment, lack of community trust, and poor follow-up. The article highlights how traditional, community-based knowledge has proven more reliable than technology in real-time disaster response, especially in areas like Ghizer and Skardu Valley. With Pakistan experiencing a 1.3°C temperature rise since the 1950s and nearly 90 GLOF events between 2019 and 2022, the integration of Indigenous knowledge into official disaster management frameworks is increasingly critical for climate resilience.",
