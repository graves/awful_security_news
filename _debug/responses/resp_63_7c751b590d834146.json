  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A coalition of seven prominent universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a funding compact proposed by the Trump administration. The proposal offers expanded federal funding in exchange for ideological policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. Universities argue that accepting the compact would compromise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House claims the compact would provide preferential access to grants and federal partnerships, with enforcement via annual anonymous polls. While some institutions like the University of Texas at Austin have expressed openness to dialogue, others maintain a firm stance on preserving academic independence. The broader conflict reflects a political effort to exert control over higher education, a core institution of American democracy and innovation.",
