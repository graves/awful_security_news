    "The shift from middle-class political engagement to working-class, survival-based protests reflects a transformation in political dynamics, making society more volatile and prone to repression.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 have severely damaged the country's economy and systematically eroded its middle class — a historically moderate, reform-oriented group that has driven political stability and reform movements. A study in the European Journal of Political Economy uses a synthetic control method to show that without sanctions, Iran’s middle class would have grown by 17% between 2012 and 2019, but instead shrank by 28%. This decline has led to rising inequality, inflation (42.4%), high unemployment (7.4%–9.2%), and a shift from middle-class demands for rights to working-class protests focused on survival. The article highlights that sanctions have benefited the elite and state-linked institutions like the IRGC and bonyads, while starving independent entrepreneurs and civil servants. As a result, political engagement has fragmented, and the perception of inequality threatens national unity. Experts warn that rebuilding the middle class is a generational challenge, even if sanctions are lifted.",
