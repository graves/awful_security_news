    "Virginia Giuffre, a known survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, claims in her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl' that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister' (later identified as Prince Andrew in the US version), describing brutal physical abuse including choking and being laughed at during the assault.",
    "The memoir alleges that Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles, had sexual encounters with Giuffre when she was 17, including three instances, and that he allegedly tried to hire online trolls to discredit her during her legal case.",
    "Giuffre claims that Prince Andrew’s team attempted to dig up dirt on her by having a police bodyguard investigate her background, prompting London’s Metropolitan Police to begin an active inquiry.",
    "Newly uncovered emails from 2011 show Prince Andrew writing to Epstein stating they were 'in this together' and would 'play some more soon,' contradicting his earlier claim of ending the relationship in December 2010.",
    "Prince Andrew had previously agreed to a $10 million settlement in 2022 to resolve civil claims brought by Giuffre, which she describes as a form of financial compensation after being subjected to public attacks and smear campaigns.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl' in October 2025, alleging that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister' — identified as Prince Andrew in the US version — during her teenage years. The memoir includes harrowing details of physical abuse, including choking, and claims that Prince Andrew’s team tried to discredit her by hiring online trolls and having a police officer dig into her background. Contradictory emails from 2011 suggest Prince Andrew continued to have contact with Epstein after claiming to have ended their relationship. These revelations deepen the transatlantic scandal over powerful figures’ ties to Epstein, challenge Prince Andrew’s public statements, and intensify scrutiny of royal family involvement in trafficking networks. The memoir has prompted renewed public and political attention, with the Metropolitan Police investigating claims that Andrew's bodyguard was tasked with investigating Giuffre, and the royal family facing ongoing reputational damage.",
