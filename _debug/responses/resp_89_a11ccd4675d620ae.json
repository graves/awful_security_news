  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York state prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the fatal beating of inmate Robert Brooks at Marcy Correctional Facility on the night of Dec. 9, 2024. Brooks, who had been transferred from a nearby prison, was assaulted three times while handcuffed, with the final beating in the infirmary captured on silent body-camera footage. The video showed guards, including Kingsley, Galliher, and Kieffer, engaging in violent acts with apparent indifference. While Kingsley was found guilty, Galliher and Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges, though both were charged with second-degree gang assault. The prosecution argued that all guards acted as a gang, showing a depraved indifference to human life. William Fitzpatrick, the special prosecutor, took over the case after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself, citing conflicts of interest. Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards involved in the March 1, 2025, beating and death of inmate Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility. Six of the 10 guards indicted in February were charged with murder, with five pleading guilty to manslaughter and one to a misdemeanor, while three others have agreed to reduced charges and are cooperating. The case has sparked national attention over systemic abuse and accountability in correctional institutions.",
