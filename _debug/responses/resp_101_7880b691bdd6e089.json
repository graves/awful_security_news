  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing deep internal disunity, political disloyalty, and failure to anticipate the rise of conservative initiatives like Project 2025 as key reasons. In her new book, she reflects on the 2024 presidential debate, where she first observed signs of President Biden's health concerns, and attributes the party’s defeat to a lack of unity, exemplified by public skepticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney. She also addresses systemic bias against Black women in politics, noting that despite their strong voting loyalty, they were often overlooked. Jean-Pierre frames her independent identity not as a partisan shift, but as a call for accountability and a broader reimagining of American politics — emphasizing that silence in the face of political threats is complicit.",
