  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated its campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly targeting key power stations like Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5, with a surgical drone and missile attack on October 10 involving 465 drones and 32 missiles. This attack, part of a broader strategy since 2022, aims to leave civilians defenseless during the harsh winter. Russian modifications to drones and missiles have significantly improved evasion of Western air defenses, reducing interception rates from 37% to 6%. Simultaneously, corruption within Ukraine’s anti-drone systems has weakened infrastructure protection, with officials allegedly inflating costs by up to 30%. As a result, energy systems are at risk of collapse, prompting civilians to prepare with generators, power banks, and alternative fuels. Experts warn of a severe winter, with the attacks strategically timed to exploit the cold weather and public vulnerability.",
