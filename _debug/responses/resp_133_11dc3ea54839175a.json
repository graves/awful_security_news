  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current global climate commitments, the Earth will see 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from a pre-Paris scenario of 114 extra superhot days, thanks to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. However, the study reveals a stark global imbalance: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face disproportionately high heat exposure, with Panama expected to gain 149 extra superhot days annually. In contrast, the world’s largest emitters—U.S., China, and India—face only 23–30 extra days despite emitting 42% of global carbon dioxide. Experts warn that such disparities may deepen global injustice and trigger geopolitical instability, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by these extreme heat events.",
