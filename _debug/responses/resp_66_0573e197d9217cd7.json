It highlights Trump’s pattern of using offensive language, including 'shithole' during campaign rallies and in public statements. The piece also references historical instances of profanity by other leaders, such as Joe Biden’s use of 'fucking' in 2010 and 'stupid son of a bitch' toward a reporter, and Barack Obama’s call for Kanye West as a 'jackass,' as well as Dick Cheney’s 'go fuck yourself' comment in 2004.
