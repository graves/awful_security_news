    "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central estimates that the world will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 due to climate change, which is half the number projected under the worst-case scenario of 4°C warming.",
    "The Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 helped reduce the projected warming from 4°C to 2.6°C, resulting in a significant but still severe increase in dangerous heat days.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days per year, showing that climate impacts are already being felt.",
    "The disparity in heat exposure is stark: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa are expected to face massive increases in superhot days—Panama alone projected at 149 extra days—despite contributing only 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "In contrast, top polluters such as the U.S., China, and India, which account for 42% of global CO₂ emissions, will face only 23–30 extra superhot days, highlighting a profound climate injustice.",
    "Experts like Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto emphasize that even with current commitments, the world still faces a disastrous future, with tens of thousands or millions of people at risk from heat-related deaths.",
    "This unequal exposure to climate impacts may exacerbate global inequalities and contribute to geopolitical instability, as seen in the widening gap between high-emitting, wealthy nations and vulnerable, low-income island nations."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even with the Paris Climate Agreement, the world will still face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures—due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days projected under a worst-case 4°C warming scenario, but still poses severe risks to human health and global stability. The study reveals a stark inequality in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—despite contributing minimally to emissions—will face massive increases in heat days, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only a fraction of that increase. Experts warn that this imbalance could deepen global inequities and threaten geopolitical stability, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people are at risk from heat-related mortality, even under current climate commitments.",
