Sliwa has rejected this pressure, arguing that voters, particularly blue-collar working-class New Yorkers, should have the final say, and criticizing both Cuomo and billionaire donors like Bill Ackman for attempting to dictate political outcomes. Trump dismissed Sliwa as unimpressive and mocked his cat-related interests, further undermining his appeal. The article highlights a growing tension between grassroots, community-based candidates and wealthy political donors, with Sliwa positioning himself as a defender of the working class against elite influence.",
