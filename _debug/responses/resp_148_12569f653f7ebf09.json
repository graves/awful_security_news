  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalation of US-China trade tensions, culminating in Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its measures are a defensive reaction to US trade restrictions and national security concerns, while the US accuses China of 'double standards' and unfair targeting of Chinese entities. The dispute, rooted in a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls dating back to 2018 and earlier, threatens to reignite a trade war. Experts suggest both nations are using economic tools for strategic advantage, with China demonstrating greater coordination in its policies, while the US maintains broad economic leverage. The impending meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is now under pressure, with both sides preparing for potential escalation. The article underscores how rare earth minerals, essential for global technology and defense, are central to the conflict, and highlights how both economies face real economic costs—China through export losses and US through inflation and market uncertainty—while the global trade system faces growing instability.",
