In the US version, the figure is described as a 'well-known Prime Minister,' while in the UK version, he is referred to as a 'former minister,' creating a discrepancy. Giuffre claims she was 18 when she was sexually assaulted and choked by the man, who laughed during the abuse. She alleges that Prince Andrew, who is the brother of King Charles III, had multiple sexual encounters with her when she was 17, and that his team attempted to hire online trolls to harass her. Despite denying the allegations, Prince Andrew paid millions to settle a civil case in 2022. Newly discovered emails from 2011 show that he wrote to Epstein stating they were 'in this together,' contradicting his public claim of having severed ties. The memoir has reignited a transatlantic scandal involving powerful figures, elite abuse, and institutional silence, bringing renewed scrutiny to Prince Andrew and the British royal family.",
