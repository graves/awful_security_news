  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of violating a 48-hour ceasefire by launching air strikes in Paktika province, killing at least 10 civilians, including two children. The attacks, targeting a local faction linked to the Pakistan Taliban (TTP), have been condemned by Afghan officials, who claim the strikes were retaliatory for a previous attack in Pakistan's FATA region. The Afghanistan Cricket Board reports that three cricketers and five others were killed during a peaceful gathering, leading it to withdraw from an upcoming series with Pakistan. Both countries are preparing for crisis talks in Doha to address the escalation. The violence follows a week of intense border clashes, with 37 Afghan casualties reported by the UN and widespread fear among civilians, though some report temporary normalcy. The incident reflects deep-rooted security tensions, with both nations accusing each other of harboring extremist groups, and underscores the vulnerability of civilians and cultural institutions in conflict zones.",
