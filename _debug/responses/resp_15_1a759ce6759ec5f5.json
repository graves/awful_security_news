Ukrainian officials report that Russian drones continuously hover over damaged sites, preventing safe repairs and worsening civilian suffering. In response, Ukraine has launched targeted long-range missile strikes on Russian facilities, including the Bryansk Chemical Plant. President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European allies to provide critical military aid—especially air defense systems—and is advocating for the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense and recovery. Despite efforts, Ukraine remains short of air defense capabilities and faces diplomatic uncertainty, especially regarding a potential summit with Putin in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban. Analysts note a cyclical pattern: when US frustration with Russia grows, Russia escalates attacks, suggesting a dynamic of reciprocal political and military pressure.",
