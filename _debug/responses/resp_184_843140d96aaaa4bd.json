  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new wave of U.S. tariffs targeting imported kitchen cabinets, timber, furniture, steel, and copper is increasing construction and renovation costs, exacerbating an already weak housing market. These tariffs, part of a broader trade policy under President Donald Trump, have driven up material prices, affecting homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera, furniture companies such as RH and IKEA, and domestic design firms like Colony and Stillfried Design. While not immediately catastrophic, economists warn that cumulative cost pressures—especially with anticipated tariff increases in January—will continue to strain affordability, potentially leading to reduced investment in affordable housing and further inflation of consumer prices. The White House cites national security and domestic manufacturing goals, but experts argue that the real-world impact is a significant economic burden on consumers and builders alike.",
