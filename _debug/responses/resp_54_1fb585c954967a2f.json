  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal attributed to President Donald Trump, public sentiment in the United States shows little enthusiasm, with Americans largely disapproving of Trump’s handling of both foreign policy and domestic issues — particularly the economy. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC reveal that while Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly increased, disapproval remains strong, and his economy-related approval ratings have hit a personal and political low. Americans express deep economic pessimism, with low expectations for economic improvement and wage growth, and growing job insecurity. The article suggests that public priorities are firmly focused on economic well-being rather than international diplomacy, and that the fragile nature of peace agreements in the region, combined with past failures, undermines confidence in the Gaza deal’s sustainability. This reinforces the idea that Trump’s political standing is constrained by economic concerns, not foreign policy outcomes.",
