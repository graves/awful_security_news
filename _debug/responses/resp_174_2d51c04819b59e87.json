  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Belize has signed a bilateral agreement with the United States to act as a 'safe third country' for migrants deported from the U.S., allowing them to apply for asylum in Belize rather than return home. The deal, which requires strict security measures such as nationality-based eligibility, background checks, and full approval authority for Belize to accept or reject transfers, is seen by the U.S. as a major step in curbing illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system. However, Belize’s Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño described the initiative as a targeted job programme for qualified Central Americans, while opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton raised concerns about national sovereignty, financial strain, and migrant safety. The agreement echoes similar deals with Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras, reflecting a broader regional policy trend under President Donald Trump’s administration. Despite official claims of safeguards, human rights groups warn that migrants may face harm in countries where they are sent, calling the agreement ethically and practically problematic.",
