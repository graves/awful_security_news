  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New York City mayoral race, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is facing mounting pressure to withdraw from the race, including a direct appeal from his employer and fellow Republican John Catsimatidis, who argues that Sliwa must prioritize New York City over personal ambition. The pressure comes amid a broader Republican strategy to unite behind former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent to oppose the Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa, known for founding the Guardian Angels and representing blue-collar working-class voters, has dismissed the pressure, asserting that voters, not billionaire donors or political allies, should decide the outcome. Critics like Bill Ackman and Donald Trump have mocked or dismissed Sliwa, calling him a 'shock jock' or 'not exactly primetime,' further highlighting the political divide. Despite claims of coordination between Sliwa and Mamdani, both have denied such suggestions, emphasizing that the decision on the next mayor belongs to New Yorkers.",
