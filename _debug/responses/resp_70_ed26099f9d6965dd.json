  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans' access to long-term one-on-one mental health therapy through the Veterans Affairs (VA) system is being significantly restricted, with providers reporting that session limits are being enforced without clinical justification or patient input. This policy, introduced under VA Secretary Doug Collins during the Trump administration, has led to staff resignations, provider stress, and deep frustration among veterans who rely on continuous care for conditions like PTSD. Veterans such as Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized when therapy ends prematurely, while providers argue that mental health treatment for chronic conditions should be individualized and ongoing, much like physical health management. The VA denies any limits on care, asserting that treatment plans are co-developed with patients, but internal reports and expert criticism — including from the American Psychological Association — suggest a serious disconnect between policy and clinical need.",
