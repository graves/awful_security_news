  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is under increasing pressure from within his own party to withdraw, including a direct appeal from his boss, John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC-AM. The pressure comes amid a broader Republican effort to oppose Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, led by former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent and has dismissed Sliwa as not viable. Sliwa has responded by rejecting the influence of billionaire donors and asserting his commitment to representing blue-collar New Yorkers. Despite criticism from figures like Bill Ackman and President Donald Trump, who mocked Sliwa’s image and style, Sliwa remains in the race, with Mamdani aligning with him on rejecting top-down political control. The article underscores a shifting political landscape where anti-establishment, grassroots candidates are challenging traditional power structures in NYC politics.",
