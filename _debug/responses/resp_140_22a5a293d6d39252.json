  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the Diwali festival in October 2025, New Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to a hazardous level, reaching an AQI of 442—the highest in the world—due to widespread fireworks and seasonal pollution. The concentration of PM2.5 exceeded 59 times the WHO’s recommended annual limit, with the Central Pollution Control Board classifying the air as 'very poor.' Although the Supreme Court permitted limited use of environmentally safer green crackers, violations led to excessive pollution. The situation is exacerbated by cold winter weather that traps pollutants from traffic, industry, and agriculture. The crisis is not isolated; Lahore, Pakistan, also faced high pollution (AQI of 234), indicating transboundary air pollution from Indian Punjab. Authorities in both countries have responded with emergency measures, including anti-smog guns and restrictions, underscoring the need for regional cooperation to combat air pollution.",
