  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence at Paris’ La Santé prison for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 election campaign. This marks the first time in living memory that a former president has been imprisoned, making the event a major political milestone. Sarkozy, who maintains his innocence, will serve his sentence without waiting for an appeal due to the seriousness of the offense’s disruption to public order. The prison, known for housing high-profile figures such as Capt. Alfred Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal, is expected to place him in a 9-square-meter cell, possibly in a VIP section with limited privileges. Former inmates like Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological shock of incarceration, emphasizing the loss of personal freedom and the stark contrast between pre-prison life and prison reality. Sarkozy has prepared with personal items, including family photos and books such as 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' and has publicly declared he will remain defiant. His family has shown public support, with his son Louis calling for a rally and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy sharing social media tributes. The case highlights not only the legal consequences of political misconduct but also the symbolic significance of a former leader being imprisoned, raising broader questions about power, accountability, and public trust.",
