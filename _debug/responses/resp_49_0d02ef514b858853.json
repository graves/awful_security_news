The article also covers the Passage of Commodus in Rome, believed to have been used by Emperor Commodus to avoid assassination, and the London Tunnels, a Cold War shelter now undergoing a $149 million transformation to become a major tourist attraction. Additional sites include the ghost town of Kayaköy in Turkey and the ancient ruins of Babylon in Iraq, all serving as powerful reminders of human history, conflict, and resilience. The piece underscores how historical sites, once sites of danger or suffering, are now being repurposed as educational and experiential tourist destinations.",
