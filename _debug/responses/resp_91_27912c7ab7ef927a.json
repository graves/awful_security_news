  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, focusing on whether such a ban violates the Second Amendment. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Pakistan, who was indicted in 2023 after the FBI found a 9mm pistol, marijuana, and cocaine at his home, with the government citing his habitual marijuana use. A lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots. The 5th Circuit ruled that such a ban cannot apply to habitual users, but the Trump administration appealed, arguing that such users pose a danger to public safety, especially while impaired. The government also alleged Hemani’s ties to Iran and connections to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, though these claims remain disputed. Hemani's legal team countered that the historical basis for the law is weak, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana. The case is politically charged, highlighted by the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2025, potentially setting a precedent on the balance between public safety and constitutional rights in gun ownership.",
