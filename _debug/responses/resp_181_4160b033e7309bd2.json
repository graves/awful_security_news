  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel allegedly used for drug smuggling in the Caribbean. The US claims the vessel carried fentanyl and was operated by 'narco-terrorists' linked to Venezuela’s Cartel of the Suns, though experts question both the vessel’s cargo and the legality of the strikes. Two other men aboard were killed, with at least 32 deaths reported across seven attacks since September 2025. The Ecuadorean survivor was not detained due to lack of formal charges, while the Colombian survivor, Jeison Obando Pérez, sustained severe injuries and is being treated in Bogotá. The US has deployed over 10,000 troops and military assets to the region, sparking diplomatic tensions with Colombia and Venezuela. Colombian President Gustavo Petro denounced the attack as 'murder', while US President Donald Trump defended the operations as necessary to combat drug trafficking, accusing Maduro of narcotic crimes and threatening trade penalties. International legal concerns persist over whether the strikes breach international law.",
