  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling has allowed the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, overturning a prior lower court decision. However, the second restraining order remains in force, so immediate deployment is not possible. The ruling, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, is criticized by state officials and legal scholars as undermining state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. The case is now pending an en banc review by the court, with both Oregon and the administration seeking to appeal. This development is part of a broader national pattern of federal troop deployments in cities like Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco—each facing legal challenges, public resistance, and constitutional debates over presidential power, state autonomy, and civil liberties. The deployments are justified by the administration as responses to violent protests, but local officials dispute the severity of unrest and argue the actions violate federal and state laws, raising broader concerns about militarizing civil disobedience and the limits of executive authority.",
