The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, has drawn criticism from a Clinton-appointed judge and Oregon officials who argue it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. Similar legal challenges are unfolding in Illinois (Chicago), Tennessee (Memphis), and San Francisco, where local leaders reject troop deployments as unconstitutional, unnecessary, or misaligned with actual safety conditions. A bipartisan group of senators has called for a federal inquiry into the broader impact of these domestic deployments on military readiness. The article highlights a growing national debate over the balance of presidential power, state autonomy, and the use of military forces in civil unrest, especially in response to immigration policy protests.",
