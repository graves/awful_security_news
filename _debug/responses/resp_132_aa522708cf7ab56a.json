  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government is in a prolonged shutdown, now entering its fourth week and possibly becoming one of the longest in history. This crisis stems from a political deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over the expiration of enhanced health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which end on December 31, 2025. President Donald Trump has refused to compromise, asserting that Democratic demands are 'crazy' and refusing to engage on health care funding unless the government reopens. Republican senators, including John Thune, maintain a unified stance, while Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have grown more confident after mass rallies and have repeatedly voted against temporary government reopenings. As a result, vital federal programs such as Head Start and WIC face funding cuts, and agencies like the National Nuclear Security Administration furlough employees. Economists from Goldman Sachs, the CBO, and Oxford Economics warn that the shutdown could reduce economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week and disrupt key services, including small business loans and mortgage insurance. The White House meeting on October 21, 2025, is a pivotal moment for potential negotiations, though Trump has signaled he will not act without reopening the government. With open enrollment for ACA coverage beginning on November 1, 2025, there is growing public anxiety about rising health care costs and the lack of a political solution.",
