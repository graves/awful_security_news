    "The White House announced a pricing deal with EMD Serono (a subsidiary of Merck KGaA) to offer fertility drugs like Gonal-F, Ovidrel, and Cetrotide at over 70% reduced prices via the TrumpRx platform launching in January 2026.",
    "The reduced prices could bring the cost of these drugs down from $5,000 per IVF cycle to under $1,500, representing a significant reduction in financial burden for patients.",
    "The deal includes a reprieve from certain tariffs in exchange for U.S. manufacturing and research investment by EMD Serono.",
    "Pfizer and AstraZeneca also signed agreements with the administration to offer fertility drugs on TrumpRx as part of tariff relief deals.",
    "The administration is encouraging employers to offer IVF coverage as an elective add-on benefit, similar to vision or dental plans, to remain competitive with talent.",
    "Approximately 60% of women aged 30 to 44 get insurance through their employers, making this a major opportunity for expanded access.",
    "Despite the promise of reduced prices, experts express concern about the exclusivity of the deal—only EMD Serono is covered, leaving out key competitors like Organon and Ferring, which produce critical fertility drugs.",
    "The move does not include a federal mandate for universal IVF coverage, falling short of Trump’s campaign pledge to have government or insurance companies pay for all IVF treatment.",
    "Concerns remain about infrastructure gaps, including the elimination of CDC staff responsible for monitoring fertility treatment outcomes.",
    "The broader fertility drug market relies on multiple manufacturers, and a deal with one company may not fully address affordability or access for all patients."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced a major initiative to reduce the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs through a new platform called TrumpRx, which will launch in January 2026. The plan includes a more than 70% price reduction for three key fertility drugs—Gonal-F, Ovidrel, and Cetrotide—produced by EMD Serono (a subsidiary of Merck KGaA), currently priced at $5,000 per cycle. The deal includes a tariff reprieve in exchange for U.S. manufacturing and research investments. Pfizer and AstraZeneca are also joining with similar agreements. The administration is urging employers to offer IVF coverage as a voluntary add-on to attract talent, though no federal mandate exists. Critics argue that the deal excludes major competitors like Organon and Ferring, and that without strong infrastructure and oversight, broader access and patient outcomes may be compromised. This policy marks a significant but limited step toward expanding IVF access, falling short of Trump’s earlier campaign promise of universal, government-paid coverage.",
