  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery across American media, fashion, and politics, highlighting how the modern cowboy symbol — popularized by 19th-century Wild West shows and mid-20th-century films — has become a dominant cultural force. This trend is driven by conservative political movements, especially under the Trump administration, which uses cowboy symbolism to promote individualism and patriotism. The cowboy image is shown as a mythologized, romanticized version of American identity, obscuring the real history of cowboys as primarily Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans. While media such as 'Yellowstone', Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour, and fashion campaigns celebrate the cowboy, the article points out that these depictions ignore the working realities of cowboy life — including poverty and low wages — and often rely on outdated, whitewashed stereotypes. Artists like Gabriela Hasbun and photographers like Richard Avedon challenge these myths by showcasing the true diversity and struggles of Western communities. Despite this, the cowboy trend remains deeply embedded in American culture, reflecting both a political and aesthetic backlash against urban and liberal values, and indicating a persistent cultural fascination with the myth of the rugged, patriotic American West.",
