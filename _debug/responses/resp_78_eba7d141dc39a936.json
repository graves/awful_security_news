  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in October 2025, national parks across the U.S. face significant operational and safety challenges due to the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees. While some parks—like those in West Virginia—remain open with state funding to preserve tourism and local economies, others face increased risks of illegal activity such as base jumping and drone use, as well as environmental degradation like trash buildup. Advocacy groups warn that the lack of rangers and staff undermines public safety, emergency response, and visitor education. Meanwhile, tourism patterns have shifted, with visitors migrating to private museums in Washington, D.C., following closures of major federal institutions. While some businesses report no immediate impact, others—including vacation rentals and tour operators—express concerns about long-term economic harm, especially during peak seasons. The article underscores a growing debate about whether national parks should remain open during shutdowns, balancing public access with safety, environmental preservation, and economic sustainability.",
