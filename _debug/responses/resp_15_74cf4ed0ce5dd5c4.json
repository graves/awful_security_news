Don Davis. This move comes in response to President Donald Trump’s national demand for Republican-led redistricting to prevent Democratic gains. Republicans argue the new map respects voter will and counters decades of Democratic gerrymandering, while Democrats accuse the process of being undemocratic and politically motivated, citing Trump’s influence and concerns over the erosion of democratic principles. The map now moves to the North Carolina House for final approval, with no veto power held by Governor Josh Stein, and litigation is expected. This event reflects a broader national conflict over redistricting, where states like Texas and California are engaging in parallel efforts to reshape congressional districts in response to each other’s political actions.",
