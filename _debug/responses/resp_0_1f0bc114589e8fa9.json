    "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Representative Adelita Grijalva.",
    "The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires elected members to be sworn in if qualified, and that no constitutional authority exists for the Speaker to delay swearing-in based on the House being in recess.",
    "Speaker Mike Johnson claims he is following the precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who delayed swearing-in members elected during recesses until the House returned to session.",
    "The lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s refusal to seat Grijalva is politically motivated, aimed at blocking a petition to release Jeffrey Epstein-related records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations.",
    "The suit claims that Johnson has no valid reason to deny the oath, as he has been present in the Capitol and does not dispute Grijalva’s qualifications or election.",
    "The lawsuit seeks a court order allowing a qualified person to administer the oath to Grijalva, emphasizing that the Constitution does not assign the authority to the Speaker to delay such a process.",
    "The case raises constitutional questions about the role of the Speaker and the obligation to seat duly elected members in accordance with the Constitution.",
    "The delay is said to harm both Grijalva’s ability to serve and the people of Arizona by reducing their representation in Congress."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Representative Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires elected members to be seated once qualified, and that no constitutional authority exists for the Speaker to delay swearing-in based on the House being in recess. Johnson claims he is following the precedent set by Nancy Pelosi, who delayed seating members elected during recesses. However, the lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s actions are politically motivated, aimed at blocking a petition to release Jeffrey Epstein-related records and to strengthen his position in budget negotiations. The suit asserts that Johnson has no valid reason to deny the oath, as he has been present and does not dispute Grijalva’s qualifications. It seeks a court order allowing a qualified individual to administer the oath to Grijalva, emphasizing constitutional obligations and the harm caused to both Grijalva and Arizona’s representation in Congress.",
