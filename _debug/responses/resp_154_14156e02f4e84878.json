  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has suffered a recent heist involving the theft of eight Napoleonic pieces of jewellery, marking a shift from previous thefts that primarily targeted paintings like the Mona Lisa. This event is distinct due to the high intrinsic value of jewellery, which can be sold in components and recut without trace, making recovery extremely difficult. The article traces a historical timeline of Louvre thefts, including the 1911 Mona Lisa theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, which boosted the painting’s global fame; the 1940 Nazi looting attempts, which were averted by director Jacques Jaujard’s evacuation of artworks; and earlier incidents such as the 1966 jewellery theft during a U.S. loan and the 1990 theft of Renoir’s portrait. The 2025 heist underscores the evolving nature of museum security threats, with the potential for stolen items to be deconstructed and resold, and emphasizes that recovery efforts rely heavily on high-value rewards to incentivize the return of intact pieces.",
