  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' approached, six of the original nine institutions — including MIT, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth — publicly rejected the agreement. The Compact required schools to enforce gender-based bathroom and sports policies, freeze tuition, limit international students, and require standardized tests for admissions, all in exchange for preferential federal funding. Institutions cited concerns about academic integrity, merit-based research, and political interference, especially given prior cancellations of federal grants over DEI and transgender policies. Despite White House outreach to several schools, including UVA and Dartmouth, these institutions reaffirmed their opposition, signaling a significant resistance movement within higher education against politically conditional funding.",
