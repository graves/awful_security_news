  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Missouri is facing a public and legal battle over its newly gerrymandered congressional map, which was passed by a Republican-dominated legislature and targets the seat of long-time Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II. Grassroots activists, led by Leann Villaluz and the organization People Not Politicians Missouri, are collecting over 100,000 signatures to hold a 2026 referendum that would let voters decide whether to keep or reject the map. The group contends that redistricting dilutes voter power and undermines fair representation, especially in areas like Kansas City that face existing challenges in housing, transportation, and mental health. State officials, including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, have challenged the referendum, arguing it violates constitutional law, while some Republicans, including Bill Allen and 15 lawmakers, oppose the map on principle. The effort is part of a broader national trend, with states like Texas, North Carolina, and others following Trump's push for Republican-controlled redistricting, while California seeks to counter it. The outcome could set a precedent for how redistricting is challenged in the U.S.",
