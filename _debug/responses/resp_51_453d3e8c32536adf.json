  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed the standard Senate confirmation process. The DOJ argues that the appointment is lawful under delegated authority, citing precedent and the fact that 16 US attorneys have been confirmed recently. However, legal counsel Abbe Lowell contends that full delegation of US attorney powers is unprecedented and unconstitutional, asserting that such appointments violate the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges in Nevada and California, and intersects with political controversies involving former Trump attorney Habba, former FBI Director James Comey, and attorney general Letitia James. A panel of three judges, including two appointed by Republican presidents and one by Barack Obama, is weighing whether Habba’s appointment constitutes a lawful exercise of presidential authority or an unlawful circumvention of constitutional procedures.",
