The heist, which lasted only seven minutes and involved a truck-mounted ladder and tools like an angle grinder, targeted the Apollo Gallery. Authorities estimate the value at $102 million. Investigations have recovered a scooter and a helmet, but no solid leads have been found. Experts, including French officials and art recovery specialists, believe the stolen items were likely dismantled and sold on the black market or melted down for cash, indicating a very low chance of recovery. The incident has exposed serious security flaws at the museum, with officials acknowledging failures in window security and equipment placement. The heist is widely seen as a symbolic attack on French cultural heritage, drawing comparisons to past high-profile museum thefts such as the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 Corot painting theft.",
