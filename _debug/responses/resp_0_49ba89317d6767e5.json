  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has expressed hopes for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, but that effort may be delayed after a scheduled pre-meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was postponed due to disagreements over the feasibility of ending the war. Although both leaders previously agreed on the need for dialogue, officials note that Russia has not made significant changes to its maximalist stance, leading to a lack of progress in the diplomatic coordination. The White House emphasizes Trump’s commitment to peace and diplomatic solutions, while the Kremlin views the recent calls as constructive. As of now, the Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, Hungary, remains under discussion, but the absence of a clear path forward in pre-summit talks may stall the process.",
