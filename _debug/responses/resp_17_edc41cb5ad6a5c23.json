  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday. It poses a severe threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where it could bring over a foot of rain, leading to dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, Puerto Rico and parts of the East Coast could face heavy rain and rough surf. The storm’s development is linked to extremely warm Caribbean waters, which are fueling more intense storms due to climate change, and the trend of rapid intensification seen in recent hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Forecasters are tracking two possible paths: one toward Hispaniola with a northward turn, and another westward toward Central America. The storm’s track remains uncertain, and its final impact will be determined over the coming days.",
