  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals deep-seated labor exploitation in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where workers—mostly women—face extreme working hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats to their safety. Despite being critical to Guatemala’s economy (contributing nearly 10% of GDP), these factories operate in secrecy, with no worker protections, union rights, or accountability. US brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt source garments from Guatemalan factories, often through intermediaries, with no legal responsibility for worker conditions. Korean-owned companies dominate investments, and worker unions are either non-existent or violently suppressed. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial ruin when factories close, with little recourse or compensation. The Guatemalan government, though making reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, struggles to enforce labor regulations, and workers report being blocked from inspections. The article underscores a global supply chain crisis where women are disproportionately exploited, and systemic power imbalances allow for abuse and silence.",
