  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the October 2025 government shutdown, the White House announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically dedicated to child nutrition — to fund the WIC program, which supports nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This move was intended to prevent the program from shutting down within weeks, as Congress had failed to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the administration claims this is a 'creative solution' and highlights bipartisan support for WIC, critics — including budget experts — question the legality and authorization of redirecting tariff funds without congressional appropriation. The National WIC Association welcomed the effort but stressed uncertainty about funding amounts, distribution speed, and sustainability. The program has seen rising enrollment due to improved access and inflation pressures, and advocates warn that long-term funding remains insufficient even after the shutdown ends.",
