  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, citing extensive testing that revealed these models frequently recommend extreme political parties—such as the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) and the left-wing Green Left-Labour Party—while largely ignoring centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The watchdog emphasizes that AI systems provide biased, distorted, and unverifiable advice due to lack of transparency, and warns that such use undermines the integrity of democratic elections. This comes at a critical time as the Netherlands prepares for parliamentary elections on October 29, following political instability caused by the PVV’s refusal to support a coalition over immigration policy. The article underscores the growing risks of AI influencing political decisions and calls on both voters and AI developers to avoid using these tools for voting guidance.",
