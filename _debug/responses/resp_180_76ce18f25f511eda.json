  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article debunks four common haircare myths, including the idea that cold water increases shine, split ends can be repaired, hair growth is accelerated by cutting, and that hair can 'self-clean' without washing. Experts Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker from UK Hair Consultants and Hair and Scalp Clinic explain that split ends cannot be mended and must be trimmed, that cold water does not enhance shine, and that regular washing is essential to prevent scalp infections and dandruff. Professor Laura Waters of the University of Huddersfield adds that sulfate-free shampoos are better for dry hair, while dry shampoo should be used sparingly to avoid oil buildup and yeast growth. The key message is that healthy hair comes from simple, science-based practices rather than expensive products or trends.",
