    "The political dynamic reflects a broader struggle over representation: between working-class, grassroots candidates like Sliwa and Mamdani, and elite, donor-backed candidates like Cuomo and Trump-aligned figures."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing growing pressure from his boss John Catsimatidis and other Republicans, including Andrew Cuomo, to withdraw from the race. Catsimatidis urges Sliwa to prioritize New York City over his personal campaign, while Cuomo, running as an independent, positions himself as a moderate alternative to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and criticizes Sliwa as an unviable candidate. Sliwa, who founded the Guardian Angels and has a strong grassroots appeal, firmly rejects the pressure, arguing that voters—especially blue-collar working-class people—should have the final say, not billionaire donors. Trump dismisses Sliwa as a weak candidate, adding to the narrative of political skepticism. The situation has created a tense dynamic between Sliwa and both Cuomo and Mamdani, with Mamdani dismissing claims of coordination and emphasizing the need for direct voter engagement. As the race unfolds, the article highlights a broader debate over representation, influence, and the role of media and wealth in shaping political outcomes in New York City.",
