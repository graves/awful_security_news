    "The US Marine Corps fired artillery shells over I-5 interstate highway in California during a 250th birthday celebration, leading to a premature detonation of one shell.",
    "The shell exploded over the highway, sending fragments that struck and damaged a California Highway Patrol cruiser, raising safety concerns.",
    "This incident marks the first such firing over I-5 in over 70 years, and the route was last used before the interstate was built in the 1950s.",
    "The shell that detonated was part of a batch previously tested successfully with over 20 shells fired the day before, raising questions about consistency and safety.",
    "The Marine Corps is investigating the cause of the premature detonation, and the batch has been frozen and will not be reused until further clarification.",
    "A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed manufacturing issues, including cracked shells in Iowa and a shift from TNT to a different explosive, later reversed due to production needs during the Ukraine war.",
    "The demonstration was part of a public showcase for VIPs, including Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, with officials claiming it is a standard safe practice.",
    "California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the decision to fire over the interstate, calling it 'dangerous' and closing the highway ahead of the exercise.",
    "The shell weighed 95 pounds, with only 15 pounds of explosive; fragments fell slowly, striking a patrol car, not from direct impact.",
    "Retired Marine Corps colonel Mark Cancian noted that the shell's high trajectory should have minimized risk, making the premature detonation abnormal and concerning."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate highway â€” a route not used since the 1950s. One of the 155mm shells fired prematurely detonated, sending fragments that struck and damaged a California Highway Patrol cruiser. Although no injuries occurred, the incident raised serious safety concerns, especially given that the same batch of shells had been successfully fired the day before. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause of the premature detonation, which may be linked to manufacturing defects uncovered in a 2024 Reuters investigation. The demonstration, which was part of a standard VIP showcase, was criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who deemed it dangerous and closed the highway in advance. Experts, including retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian, noted that the high trajectory of the shells should have minimized risk, making the explosion abnormal and concerning.",
