    "Scientists from Australia's CSIRO discovered two new species in the deep sea: a semi-transparent porcelain crab about 1.5cm long and a West Australian Lantern Shark up to 40cm long.",
    "The porcelain crab, found at 122m depth, uses hair-like structures to filter plankton rather than claws, a unique feeding adaptation.",
    "The lantern shark, found over 600m below sea level, is bioluminescent with glowing photophores on its belly and flanks, a key feature in deep-sea survival.",
    "The discoveries are part of a larger effort to explore Australia’s uncharted deep-sea waters, which are rich in biodiversity but largely unknown to science.",
    "About 20 new species have been identified so far, with an estimated 600 more yet to be described, reflecting the vast potential for future discovery.",
    "Australia is a global biodiversity hotspot, home to over a million unique species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth."
