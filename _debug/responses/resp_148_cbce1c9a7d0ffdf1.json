Hanegbi acknowledged shared responsibility for the failures that led to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which has not yet been established by the government. In response, Netanyahu appointed Gil Reich, deputy head of the National Security Council, as acting head. The move has drawn sharp criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accuse the government of evading accountability and replacing dissenting voices with loyalists, underscoring deep political divisions over national security policy and responsibility for past failures.",
