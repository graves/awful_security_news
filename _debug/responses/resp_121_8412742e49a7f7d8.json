  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In late October 2025, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg issued two memos requiring Pentagon officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—to obtain prior approval from the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office before communicating with Congress. This marks a significant shift from previous practices where individual military branches managed their own interactions. The policy, described by Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell as a 'pragmatic step' to improve transparency, accuracy, and responsiveness, has been met with backlash, including the departure of most Pentagon reporters who refused to comply with the new restrictions. The move appears to reflect a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress and the public.",
