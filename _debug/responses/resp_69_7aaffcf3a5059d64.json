  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic late-game comebacks, record-breaking performances, and high-profile quarterback changes. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter, becoming the first team to survive a shut-out scenario after leading by 18+ points in the first three quarters. Quarterback Bo Nix delivered a standout performance, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two, culminating in a game-winning field goal. The Green Bay Packers also secured a win through a final-quarter surge and defensive dominance, highlighted by Micah Parsons' key disruption. On the offensive side, Drake Maye of the New England Patriots broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate in a 31-13 win over the Titans, marking a new era for the team. Meanwhile, poor performances by Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields led to their benchings by the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, respectively, signaling growing instability in two struggling franchises. The article underscores the volatility and unpredictability of the current NFL season, with record-breaking lead changes and evolving quarterback dynamics reshaping team futures.",
