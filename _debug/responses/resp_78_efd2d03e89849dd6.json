  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sparked widespread backlash by posting a social media message urging immigrants to 'remigrate' and use a self-deportation app. Experts warn that the term 'remigrate' has a long and troubling history, originating with Nazi antisemitic policies such as the Madagascar Plan, and has since been embraced by far-right movements as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing under the 'Great Replacement Theory.' This theory posits that non-white populations are being systematically replaced by immigrants, with remigration proposed as a nonviolent alternative. The term has gained traction in far-right political discourse in Europe, notably in Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, where asylum-seekers and even native-born citizens are targeted for deportation to countries like Albania. The European Court of Justice has recently ruled that such actions must not endanger asylum-seekers in their home countries. The use of the term in U.S. policy raises serious concerns, as it may be interpreted as a signal of legitimizing extremist ideologies and promoting racial homogenization, particularly in the context of rising far-right movements in both the U.S. and Europe.",
