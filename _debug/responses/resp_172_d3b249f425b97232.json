  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough that could lead to new treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, with the science prizes (physics, chemistry, medicine) awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, literature by the Swedish Academy, and peace by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. This year's announcements highlight both scientific advancements—such as breakthroughs in AI, gene regulation, and protein structure prediction—and the political controversy surrounding Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the Peace Prize, despite experts noting that the prize traditionally honors durable peace and institutional work. The article emphasizes the global significance of the Nobel Prizes as a benchmark for human achievement, with strict nomination and review processes designed to preserve scientific and academic integrity, while also underscoring threats to academic freedom from political interference.",
