  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman, was found dead in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia, after being missing for about two weeks. Authorities say an anonymous tip led them to return to the site, where they discovered the remains, which were confirmed through DNA testing. Keon King, a 21-year-old from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. His cellphone locations and video footage link him to Scott’s disappearance, and a stolen black Hyundai Accent was seen near the site and later found on fire. Prosecutors say more charges are being pursued and that others may have been involved. King was previously arrested in a separate kidnapping case where charges were dropped due to lack of testimony. The case highlights the role of anonymous tips, digital evidence, and the legal process in resolving missing persons cases.",
