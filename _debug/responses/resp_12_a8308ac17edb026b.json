    "Government shutdowns have become less frequent since 1990, but recent political polarization and procedural barriers like the Senate filibuster have prolonged legislative delays.",
    "Republican Speaker Mike Johnson oversees a narrow House majority, and without 60 Senate votes, the GOP lacks the power to overcome a filibuster, complicating negotiations to reopen the government."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on the ongoing full government shutdown in the United States, highlighting that the most recent shutdown—starting on December 22, 2018, and ending on January 25, 2019—was the longest in nearly 50 years and cost an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The 2018 shutdown was partial, affecting about 800,000 employees, with 300,000 furloughed and others exempted. In contrast, the current shutdown is a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. Political factors, such as the narrow Republican majority in the House and the Senate filibuster, have made bipartisan negotiations difficult. The article underscores how political polarization and procedural barriers contribute to prolonged government shutdowns, impacting federal operations and public services.",
