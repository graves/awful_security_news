  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The University of Arizona has refused to sign the Trump administration’s 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,' citing a commitment to academic freedom, merit-based funding, and institutional independence. The compact, which includes provisions such as eliminating race and sex-based admissions, limiting international student enrollment to 15%, and abolishing departments that suppress conservative ideas, has drawn widespread criticism from academic groups like the AAUP and AFT, who view it as politically motivated favoritism. The University of Arizona is the seventh university to reject the policy, joining institutions such as MIT, Brown, Penn, USC, and Dartmouth. While Vanderbilt and UT Austin have not yet responded, the backlash reflects a broader resistance among elite universities to politically driven mandates that threaten academic autonomy. This conflict is part of a larger trend since January 2025, during which the Trump administration cut federal research funding, particularly targeting schools involved in pro-Palestinian protests, with a federal judge recently ruling that Harvard’s grant cancellations were unlawful and ideologically motivated.",
