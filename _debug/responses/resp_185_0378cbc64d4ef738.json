  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Subramanyam 'Subu' Vedam, a legal permanent resident of the United States, spent over 40 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, including 43 years of incarceration. After new evidence exonerated him of the murder of Tom Kinser, a college student, and the Centre County District Attorney declined to pursue a new trial, Vedam was finally released from prison. However, he was immediately taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and faces deportation to India, where he has no family ties. Despite being cleared of the murder charge, his drug conviction from 1984 remains, and ICE cites a 1988 deportation order as justification for detaining him. His family and legal team argue that his decades of good behavior, community service, and educational achievements should be considered, and that deportation represents a second wrong against a man who has already endured a historic injustice. The case raises concerns about how immigration enforcement agencies respond to individuals who have been exonerated of serious crimes, especially when they have demonstrated rehabilitation and strong ties to the United States.",
