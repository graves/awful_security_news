  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by systematically poisoning her protein shakes and other household items with arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. Over several days in March 2023, Craig conducted online searches for poisons, purchased toxic substances such as arsenic and potassium cyanide, and used a fake email account to plan the murder. He arranged for the delivery of cyanide to his office, where it was mishandled by staff, and used protein shakes containing tetrahydrozoline to induce symptoms. Medical professionals and staff at multiple hospitals observed worsening symptoms and raised concerns. Forensic toxicology tests confirmed high levels of toxins in Angela’s blood. The case highlights the dangers of premeditated domestic violence, the misuse of medical and consumer products, and the critical role of early detection and staff vigilance in preventing fatalities.",
