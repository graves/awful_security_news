  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE operation in Chicago that led to over 1,000 arrests of migrants between September and October 2025. In response to escalating protests and concerns about the use of force—including tear gas and pepper balls—Ellis expanded her temporary restraining order to require federal agents to activate body-worn cameras during demonstrations. While CBP agents are mandated to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams lack them and have not been issued new devices. Agents are trained in crowd control and media interactions, but a pastor reported being struck multiple times with pepper balls without warning. The federal leadership has been described as unstable, with frequent changes in top officials like Russell Hott, who left Chicago to return to Washington. Judge Ellis plans to depose Hott and Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts of events on the ground, while the White House has denied reports of unapproved force use. This hearing underscores tensions between federal enforcement authority and public accountability, especially in the context of protest responses and media transparency.",
