President Donald Trump hosts Republican senators at a newly renovated White House event, framing the shutdown as a political test of Republican unity and emphasizing that health care negotiations are not possible until the government reopens. Key federal programs like Head Start and WIC are at risk of funding cuts, while agencies such as the National Nuclear Security Administration and the FAA face operational disruptions. Economists from Goldman Sachs and the CBO warn of significant economic losses, with weekly reductions in growth. As the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies approaches on December 31, rising health care costs threaten millions of Americans, especially as open enrollment begins on November 1. Democratic leaders are pushing for negotiations, but Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, maintain that no compromise on health care funds is possible without reopening the government. The article underscores a deep political and economic crisis rooted in legislative gridlock.",
