    "The Net Zero Framework would have been the first global carbon-pricing system for shipping, imposing a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess CO2 emissions and rewarding emission reductions.",
    "The IMO's goal is to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, with climate change already affecting shipping through altered ocean currents and more frequent storms.",
    "Countries like China, the EU, Brazil, Britain, and Singapore had previously supported the framework, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF)—a global carbon-pricing system for shipping—by at least 12 months due to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, who called the emissions plan a 'global green new scam tax' and threatened sanctions on supporting countries. The decision, made during a London meeting, reversed momentum from April when the framework was approved by 176 member states. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain maintained their backing, while opponents such as Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it; Argentina and Singapore, previously supportive, changed their stance to postpone. The NZF would have imposed a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess emissions and rewarded emission reductions, aiming to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. Industry leaders and climate advocates, including the International Chamber of Shipping and Vanuatu’s climate minister, criticized the delay as undermining progress on climate change and disrupting the shipping sector’s transition to cleaner fuels. The incident highlights the growing influence of national political agendas, particularly fossil fuel-driven policies, on international climate initiatives.",
