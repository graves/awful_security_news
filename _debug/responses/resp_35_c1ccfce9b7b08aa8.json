  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man who faked his death in 2020 to evade rape charges, to a prison term ranging from five years to life. Rossi, who was identified through a DNA match from a decade-old rape kit, had previously been convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He used aliases such as Arthur Knight and a false identity tied to Brown University to evade capture, and was arrested in Scotland in 2024 after being recognized by hospital staff through tattoos. The victim testified about being coerced into financial obligations and raped in his apartment, and the court found him guilty. Despite claiming innocence, Rossi was convicted, and the case underscores the importance of DNA backlog resolution and the dangers of flight by predators. Authorities from Rhode Island, Utah, and Scotland, along with the FBI, are involved in tracking and prosecuting him, reflecting broader efforts to combat sexual violence and offender evasion.",
