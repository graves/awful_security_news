  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Alex Acosta, former U.S. attorney and labor secretary under Donald Trump, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein in a closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee, arguing that a federal trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to weak evidence, victim testimony issues, and jurisdictional concerns. Acosta stated that all prosecutors in his office supported the plea agreement to ensure Epstein served time, and that the decision was not influenced by political considerations. He acknowledged public criticism and admitted that the work release program allowing Epstein to leave jail during the day was controversial and opposed by his office. Acosta denied any direct involvement in interviews with Donald Trump or knowledge of Trump being questioned about Epstein, asserting that such decisions are outside the purview of U.S. attorneys. The case remains highly scrutinized due to public allegations of connections between Trump and Epstein, especially through media reports from 2002 and 2007, and Acosta’s resignation in 2019 in the wake of growing controversy.",
