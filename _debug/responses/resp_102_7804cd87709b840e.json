  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that reversing decades-old advice to avoid peanuts in infants has significantly reduced the incidence of peanut allergies in the U.S. Since 2015, when a landmark study (LEAP) demonstrated that early exposure to peanuts lowers allergy risk, health guidelines have shifted to recommend introducing peanuts to high-risk infants as early as 4 to 6 months. This change, reflected in policies such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has led to a 43% drop in peanut allergy rates and a 36% drop in overall food allergies among young children. The study, led by pediatric allergist Dr. David Hill of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, analyzed health data from over 120,000 children and estimates that the updated guidelines have prevented at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy over the past decade. While experts like Dr. Corinne Keet acknowledge limitations in data and incomplete family adherence due to fear of cross-exposure, the findings underscore a successful public health intervention with long-lasting benefits, as peanut allergies are highly persistent and only about 10% of affected children outgrow them.",
