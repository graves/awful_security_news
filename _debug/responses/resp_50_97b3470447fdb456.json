  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, public support for President Donald Trump has not improved significantly, with disapproval rates reaching record highs. While Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue increased slightly in polling, it remained balanced by strong disapproval, and overall approval on domestic issues, particularly the economy, has declined to a second-term low. Americans are increasingly pessimistic about inflation, job security, and the economy, with only 32% expecting economic improvement in the next year. The article suggests that economic concerns outweigh foreign policy achievements, and that public skepticism about peace agreements in the Middle East—echoed by the collapse of the Biden administration’s previous ceasefire—undermines trust in Trump’s international diplomacy. The article concludes that Americans are more focused on economic stability than global peace efforts, and that Trump’s political standing is being shaped less by foreign successes and more by domestic economic challenges.",
