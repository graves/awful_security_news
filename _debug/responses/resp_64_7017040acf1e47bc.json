  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue—typically allocated to child nutrition programs—to fund WIC during the ongoing government shutdown, preventing a complete collapse of the federal food assistance program for pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision follows a funding lapse caused by Congress’s failure to pass a federal spending bill for fiscal year 2026, with the USDA warning that WIC would run out of funds within days. While the National WIC Association welcomes the effort, it expresses concern over uncertainty about funding amounts, delivery timelines, and program sustainability. The move faces legal challenges, as Congress has not formally appropriated funds for WIC, and experts argue that the administration lacks legal authority to redirect tariff revenue. Despite bipartisan support, advocates emphasize the need for long-term, increased funding to maintain access to nutritious food, especially amid rising inflation and growing enrollment in the program.",
