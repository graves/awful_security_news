  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman reported missing in Philadelphia, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school, confirmed by DNA testing. Authorities say the discovery was prompted by a new, more specific anonymous tip that led them to re-examine the site. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, and other crimes related to the disappearance. Evidence including cellphone location data and video footage of a stolen Hyundai Accent—seen at a recreation center the night before Scott went missing—supports King’s involvement. The vehicle was later found on fire and compacted at a junkyard. Prosecutors believe additional individuals may have been involved, and homicide charges are under consideration. King had previously been arrested in a similar case, though charges were dropped due to witness non-appearance. Scott's parents described her as a source of light and kindness, and the case has sparked public attention and emotional reactions.",
