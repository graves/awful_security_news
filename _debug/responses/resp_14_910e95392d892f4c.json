  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement. Despite Hamas claiming to have handed over all accessible remains, Israel alleges that Hamas may be withholding information on the locations of other missing bodies and using them as leverage. The ceasefire, now in its second week, is under strain due to delays in body returns, continued killings of civilians by Israeli forces, and the closure of key aid crossings such as Rafah. Humanitarian agencies like the World Food Programme report severe food shortages due to limited access. Meanwhile, negotiations in Egypt over Phase Two of the ceasefire—covering Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and the establishment of an international force—are ongoing, with the Trump administration’s 20-point plan offering a framework for a technocratic Palestinian administration and a global security force. Hamas remains vague on disarmament and governance, and international participation in the proposed International Stabilization Force remains uncertain.",
