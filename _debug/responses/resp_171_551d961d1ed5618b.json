  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of deepfake voice scams targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using AI to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request money for a fictional rescue of kidnapped journalists. The scam, which occurred shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala from Iran, exploited the growing realism of AI voice technology. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are often indistinguishable from real human voices and are even rated as more trustworthy. Only former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti sent money, which was later frozen. Global losses from deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025, with growing concerns about AI-generated content being used to create fake videos and sexually explicit material, including child abuse content. This has prompted legal actions, including a US federal law criminalizing AI-generated intimate images and Australia banning a deepfake generation app.",
