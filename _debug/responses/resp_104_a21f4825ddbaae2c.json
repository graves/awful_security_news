  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article presents a theory developed by internet activist and author Cory Doctorow, titled 'Enshittification,' which describes how major internet platforms—such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber—evolve from user-centric startups into exploitative systems that harm both consumers and businesses. Doctorow outlines a three-stage model: in Stage 1, platforms grow rapidly and treat users fairly; in Stage 2, they prioritize business customers and begin harvesting data; and in Stage 3, they aggressively squeeze profits from users and merchants through manipulated algorithms, junk fees, and predatory pricing. The article argues that this degradation occurs due to a lack of competition and weak consumer regulation, particularly under the current consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. Doctorow proposes solutions including stronger antitrust enforcement, 'right-to-exit' regulations to allow users to take data with them, and greater interoperability between platforms to reduce monopolistic control. Amazon and Facebook have responded with denial, but the article highlights growing public and policy interest in reversing the trend of platform degradation.",
