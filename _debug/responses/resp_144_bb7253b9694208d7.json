  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed escalation of US-China trade tensions, with US President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security and a reaction to US trade restrictions targeting its industries, including maritime and shipbuilding sectors. The timing of these measures—weeks before the expected meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea—suggests strategic pre-emption. Historical context shows a pattern of tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls dating back to 2018, including Trump’s initial 25% tariffs, Biden’s semiconductor export bans, and restrictions on Huawei and TikTok. Experts argue that both nations are using economic tools as instruments of geopolitical strategy, with China showing greater strategic coordination and the US relying on market-based leverage. The conflict threatens global supply chains, especially in high-tech and defense sectors, and underscores the growing integration of economic and national security policies in great power competition. While both sides maintain escalation tools, market reactions and global economic stability will ultimately determine the outcome.",
