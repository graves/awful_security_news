  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a warning against using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, asserting that these tools provide a highly distorted and polarized view of politics. Tests on 1,500 fictional voter profiles revealed that AI models frequently recommended extremist parties—such as the Party for Freedom (PVV) and the Green Left-Labour Party—while ignoring or underrepresenting center-ground parties like Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The authority argues that such biased, unverifiable advice undermines democratic integrity by misaligning voter choices with their actual values. The warning comes amid rising public use of AI for political guidance, especially as the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is poised to win the most seats in the upcoming October 29 parliamentary election despite lacking a majority and being rejected by all major coalition partners.",
