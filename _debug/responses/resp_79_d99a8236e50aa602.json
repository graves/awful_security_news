  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition programs — to fund the WIC program during a government shutdown caused by Congress's failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. With WIC expected to run out of funds in just days, the White House redirected tariff revenue from Section 232 tariffs to maintain support for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms, and young children. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it stressed uncertainty about funding amounts, delivery speed, and duration. Experts question the legality of the move, arguing that Congress has not authorized spending on WIC. The administration claims the funding is a 'creative solution' to protect vulnerable families, while House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders have criticized Democrats for the shutdown. WIC, which serves a growing enrollment of nearly 6.9 million people, remains at risk even after the shutdown ends due to funding caps and inflation, prompting calls for increased federal support.",
