  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a national survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, due to a lack of legal evidence of a crime. The Colombian survivor, Jeison Obando Pérez, arrived in Colombia with severe injuries, raising concerns about civilian casualties. The US claims the vessel was carrying large amounts of fentanyl and was operated by a drug-trafficking group linked to Venezuela, particularly the Cartel of the Suns, while accusing President Nicolás Maduro of being behind it. The US has conducted over seven strikes since September 2025, killing at least 32 people and deploying around 10,000 troops. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro, argue the operations violate international law and occur in disputed or Colombian territorial waters, calling them acts of 'murder'. The actions have triggered diplomatic tensions, with the US threatening aid cuts and tariffs, while regional countries like Trinidad and Tobago express support for the military operations as a means to combat transnational crime and establish regional peace.",
