The robbers used a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder to break into the Apollo Gallery, where they were later seen fleeing on motorcycles. Security was compromised, with one item left behind and an attempt to set fire to the getaway truck thwarted by a guard. Four suspects, all unarmed but threatening guards, are believed to have been involved, and investigations are underway, including consideration of foreign interference. The museum remained closed for security and evidence preservation. The theft has prompted national concern over cultural heritage security, with French leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, condemning the act and pledging full efforts to recover the items and bring the perpetrators to justice.",
