    "Zimbabwe’s ruling party ZANU-PF has initiated a process to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term by two years, potentially keeping him in power until 2030.",
    "The extension would require a constitutional amendment, possibly involving referendums, and faces legal challenges from opposition figures and experts.",
    "Mnangagwa, 83, is constitutionally barred from serving beyond 2028, and such a change would violate established democratic principles unless legally justified.",
    "Internal power struggles exist within ZANU-PF: loyalists support the extension, while Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and allies oppose it, signaling a growing factional split.",
    "Opposition figures like Tendai Biti have condemned the move as unconstitutional and a threat to democratic governance.",
    "A wave of arrests, including ten elderly activists in Harare accused of planning protests, shows increased state suppression of dissent.",
    "The move has reignited public debate over democratic legitimacy, economic governance, and political transparency in Zimbabwe.",
    "Despite Mnangagwa’s claims of being a constitutionalist, internal pressure from loyalists and the broader context of economic collapse and political repression suggest a deeper power consolidation effort."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zimbabwe’s ruling party, ZANU-PF, has moved to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term by two years, potentially keeping him in power until 2030, following a resolution at its annual conference in Mutare. The plan, endorsed by party delegates, requires a constitutional amendment and may trigger referendums, but faces strong legal and political resistance, including from Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and opposition leaders like Tendai Biti. Mnangagwa, who came to power in 2017 after the fall of Robert Mugabe, is constitutionally barred from serving beyond 2028, and critics argue the extension undermines democratic principles. The move has intensified internal power struggles within ZANU-PF and led to increased state repression, including the arrest of ten elderly activists accused of planning protests. Despite Mnangagwa’s claims of being a constitutionalist, loyalists are pushing for a prolonged stay, signaling a growing political crisis rooted in governance, dissent, and legitimacy concerns.",
