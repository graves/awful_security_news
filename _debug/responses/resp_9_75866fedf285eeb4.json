  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is ending its 50+ year giant panda program after three pandas — Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — departed for China. This marks the end of a long-standing diplomatic initiative begun in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China, symbolizing 'panda diplomacy' used to strengthen relations. Though China maintains that the program supports conservation and biodiversity, deteriorating U.S.-China relations and public controversy, including viral claims of panda abuse in Memphis, have led to a decline in panda loans. With the end of contracts at Zoo Atlanta (2025), Edinburgh Zoo (2024), and Adelaide Zoo (2025), only Xin Xin in Mexico City remains in the Americas. China's focus on conservation has led to a growing panda population in the wild, but habitat threats remain. The National Zoo remains hopeful for a future reestablishment of the program, with plans for renovations and a formal application to China for renewed panda loans.",
