    "The GOP, particularly Trump allies, is promoting a narrative that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists, despite evidence showing the rallies were largely peaceful.",
    "Multiple Republican officials—including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent—have used inflammatory language to describe the rallies as being run by or populated with terrorist sympathizers or violent radicals.",
    "The rhetoric mirrors past Republican criticism of Trump supporters being labeled 'basket of deplorables' or 'garbage,' indicating a reversal in tone where the GOP now embraces broad, dehumanizing characterizations of the Democratic base.",
    "Historical data and polling show that left-wing violence does not surpass decades of right-wing violence, and public opinion is evenly split on which side poses a greater threat.",
    "The 'No Kings' rallies in June were peaceful and drew millions of attendees, with only a few alleged incidents of violence, including two alleged attacks against protesters and one involving a peacekeeper who feared a mass shooting.",
    "Democratic leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Ruben Gallego have warned against the possibility of political violence being weaponized to justify militarization and crackdowns on political dissent.",
    "Protesters in Portland have responded to Trump’s calls for National Guard deployment by wearing costumes and engaging in humorous protests, signaling skepticism and resistance to the government's narrative of widespread violence.",
    "Trump’s claim that the left is unusually violent has not gained traction with the public, as polls show Americans are evenly divided on the relative levels of left- and right-wing violence, and more view the Republican Party as extreme."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Republican Party, led by Donald Trump and key officials such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, and others, has launched a highly inflammatory and baseless campaign claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies—held in June and scheduled for October—are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists. Despite hard data showing that the rallies were largely peaceful and that left-wing violence is not outpacing decades of right-wing violence, Republican figures continue to portray the Democratic base as a group of 'terrorists' and 'unhinged radicals.' This rhetoric, reminiscent of past attacks on Trump supporters, is seen as strategically suspect and politically dangerous, as it could justify militarization and political crackdowns. Democratic leaders and public opinion polls show that the narrative is not convincing: Americans are evenly split on the level of violence from either side, and protests in places like Portland have turned humorous and defiant in response to such claims.",
