  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN and HBO Max, is undergoing a strategic review after receiving multiple expressions of interest from potential buyers, including Paramount and Comcast, with Netflix also seen as a possible suitor. Despite Paramount’s initial lowball offer being rebuffed, CEO David Ellison has continued to push for a deal, while Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has opened the door to a full sale, a split, or other structural alternatives. This shift suggests that the planned split may not proceed as originally envisioned, and instead, a more dynamic restructuring or acquisition is being evaluated. Market reactions, including a 11% share spike, reflect investor confidence in the potential value of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets.",
