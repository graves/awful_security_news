    "Coca-Cola has started selling a version of its cola made with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in the United States.",

    "The soda is currently being rolled out to 'select' cities and retailers, not nationwide.",
    "The switch aligns with President Trump’s broader criticism of high-fructose corn syrup, which he has targeted through officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his Health and Human Services Secretary.",
    "While the health experts caution that sugary sodas—whether made with cane or corn syrup—are not healthy, this move reflects a response to political and public health advocacy.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Coca-Cola has begun rolling out a new version of its cola in the United States that uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move prompted by President Donald Trump’s earlier demand. The change follows political pressure and advocacy from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has criticized corn syrup. While the soda is currently available in select cities and retailers, it does not replace Coca-Cola’s existing sugar-free or healthier beverage lines, such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, BodyArmor, and Smartwater, which have seen strong growth. Health experts note that sugary sodas remain unhealthy regardless of sweetener type, but the shift reflects broader trends in consumer demand and political influence on food and beverage industries.",
