  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically short, with only 750 metric tonnes per day entering—far below the 2,000-tonne target—due to just two open border crossings. While the number of food distribution points has increased from five to 26, the WFP still falls short of its goal of 145 points. Humanitarian aid is reaching northern areas through southern routes, but access to key locations like Gaza City and Salah al-Din Street is blocked. The ceasefire brokered by former US President Donald Trump is described as vital to prevent famine, and Hamas has so far delivered 13 of 28 pledged captives' bodies, with the Rafah crossing remaining closed until further notice. Many Palestinians are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict, indicating deep uncertainty about the ceasefire’s sustainability.",
