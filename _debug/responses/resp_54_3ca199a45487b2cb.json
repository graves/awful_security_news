  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as President Donald Trump begins construction of a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which will have a seated capacity of 650 people—more than three times that of the East Room. The new space, designed with gilded interiors and a neoclassical theme, will replace the East Wing, where first ladies have traditionally held offices. Trump claims the project has no zoning restrictions and emphasizes its alignment with White House architectural heritage. The initiative is part of a broader transformation of the White House grounds, including the paving over of the Rose Garden and gold-decorated interiors. The project has drawn public and media scrutiny, prompting White House communications director Steven Cheung to reference a 1950s reconstruction under President Truman as precedent for necessary modernization. Critics argue the demolition disrupts historical continuity, while supporters see it as a fulfillment of Trump’s long-standing vision for a grander, more luxurious entertaining space.",
