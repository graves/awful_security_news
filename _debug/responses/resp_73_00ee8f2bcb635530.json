  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz of the Christian Democratic Party won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election in October 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The victory comes amid a severe economic crisis marked by high inflation, fuel shortages, and declining natural gas exports, which led to a collapse in public support for the MAS government. Paz’s platform emphasizes gradual reform, private sector-led growth, and fiscal autonomy, contrasting with Quiroga’s push for austerity and IMF assistance. Despite winning, Paz’s party lacks a legislative majority, forcing coalition-building to govern. His running mate, Edman Lara, helped energize working-class and youth voters through anti-corruption messaging. The new administration faces urgent challenges, including securing fuel supplies and navigating resistance from labor unions like the COB, which warns of protests if social programs are threatened. Both candidates pledged improved diplomatic relations with the United States, signaling a shift from decades of anti-American policy. Paz’s inauguration on November 8 marks a pivotal moment in Bolivia’s political and economic future.",
