  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major political and judicial development, a Slovak court convicted poet Juraj Cintula, 72, of a 'terror attack' for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024. The court cited political motivation, with Cintula claiming 'moral despair' and opposition to Fico’s policies, particularly the halt of military aid to Ukraine. Although Fico survived and returned to office, the incident has intensified political polarization, with critics accusing him of authoritarianism, anti-EU sentiments, and increasing alignment with Russia. The case has sparked national debate on governance, dissent, and the limits of political power, while Cintula's lawyer plans to appeal the 21-year sentence. The broader context includes a constitutional amendment limiting same-sex rights and asserting national law over EU law, reflecting a shift toward nationalist and hardline policies in Slovakia.",
