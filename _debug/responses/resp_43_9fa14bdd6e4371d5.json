  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing mounting pressure to withdraw from the race, including a direct appeal from his boss John Catsimatidis, who owns WABC-AM and hosts Sliwa’s show. The pressure comes amid a broader Republican effort led by Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, to oppose Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and position himself as a moderate alternative. Cuomos and other Republicans have criticized Sliwa as a non-viable candidate and a 'shock jock,' while Sliwa strongly defends his candidacy, asserting that he represents working-class voters and rejects the influence of billionaire donors. President Donald Trump has mocked Sliwa, further undermining his appeal. Despite these challenges, Sliwa remains defiant and continues to campaign, while Mamdani dismisses claims of coordination between the two candidates, emphasizing that New Yorkers should have the final say in their city’s leadership.",
