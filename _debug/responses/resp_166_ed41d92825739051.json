  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS cloud outage on 2025-10-21 disrupted major UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns about over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. With AWS and Azure controlling 30–40% of the UK cloud market, critical digital infrastructure is vulnerable to cascading failures due to 'nested dependencies'. Experts warn that assuming these providers are inherently resilient is a mistake, citing past outages as evidence. While such dominance offers cost efficiency and scalability through economies of scale, it creates systemic risk and undermines national digital sovereignty. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policymakers now call for political action — including government-mandated data resilience standards and use of multiple cloud providers — to build a more resilient, diverse, and sovereign digital ecosystem.",
