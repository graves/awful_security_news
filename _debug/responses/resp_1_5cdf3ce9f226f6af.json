  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a $200 million privately funded ballroom. The group argues that the proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would overwhelm the existing structure and disrupt the building’s classical design balance. The East Wing, which has housed key staff and served as a main visitor entry point since 1942, is being removed without a full public review process, despite past precedents requiring such transparency. Preservationists and the Society of Architectural Historians emphasize that significant changes to a historic building must undergo rigorous design and public consultation. The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts are expected to eventually review the project, though demolition has already begun, raising concerns about historical integrity and democratic accountability.",
