These orders banned instruction on Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and identity-based celebrations like Black History Month. Students, many of whom are children of active duty military personnel, claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when schools removed books on LGBTQ+ issues, racism, and cultural figures like Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to restore the books, and Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ordered the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) to return all removed materials, stating that the actions were politically driven and not pedagogically justified.",
