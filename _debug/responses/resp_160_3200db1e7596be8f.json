  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court in Banska Bystrica has sentenced 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024, classifying the act as a 'terror attack' driven by political and moral despair. Cintula claimed he targeted Fico's government policies, particularly the halt of military aid to Ukraine, and accused the prime minister of 'drunk with power' and corrupt decision-making. The attack has intensified political tensions in Slovakia, with Fico accused of increasing authoritarianism, distancing the country from the EU and NATO, and pushing controversial constitutional reforms. Critics argue the incident reflects broader political polarization and democratic backsliding. The verdict has sparked debate about political violence, freedom of expression, and the limits of dissent in democracies.",
