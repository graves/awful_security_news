    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, 72, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula shot Fico five times from within one meter during a public greeting in Handlova, causing serious injuries including to the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The court found Cintula guilty of terrorism, not just murder or assault, citing his intent to target a political leader specifically and his ideological motive related to opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to hurt but not kill Fico, stating he opposed Fico’s policies that he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The verdict highlights deep societal divisions in Slovakia between populist Fico’s government and the liberal, pro-EU opposition, which blames Fico for weakening democracy and media freedom.",
    "The opposition accuses Fico of undermining democratic standards and covering up corruption, while Fico claims the opposition fuels societal fear and anger leading to violence.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism, but the court ruled that targeting a national leader with political motives constitutes terrorism.",
    "Fico, who has been in power since 2006, returned to power in 2023 and made policy shifts including ending state military support to Ukraine and overhauling public broadcasting, which critics say eroded democratic norms.",
    "Cintula, a former mine worker, stonemason, writer, and public activist, said the attack was a 'scream against fear' paralyzing society.",
    "Cintula stated he would appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'."

Cintula shot Fico five times from close range, wounding him seriously in the abdomen and other areas. The court ruled that the act constituted terrorism, not mere murder or assault, citing the specific targeting of a political leader and Cintula’s ideological opposition to Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture. The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia between the populist Fico government and liberal, pro-EU opposition parties, which accuse Fico of undermining democracy and media freedom. Fico, who has been in power since 2006, returned to leadership in 2023 and introduced policies critics say erode democratic norms. Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies without killing him, calling the attack a ‘scream against fear’ that paralyzes society. He stated he would appeal the verdict, calling it unjust. The case underscores political polarization and the dangers of ideological extremism in democracies.",
