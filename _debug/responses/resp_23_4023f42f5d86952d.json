Despite President Trump’s trade war and rising input costs from tariffs on steel, aluminum, and copper, Steinway thrives due to its high pricing, quality, and long-standing workforce. The company’s production process—spanning 11 months and involving only four to five pianos per day—relies on a unique, irreplaceable pool of skilled artisans, many of whom have trained over generations. While global supply challenges, such as limited Sitka spruce from Alaska, pose risks, the company’s commitment to quality and human skill has ensured its continued presence in the US manufacturing sector, offering a model for how traditional, artisan-based production can succeed in an era of automation and economic uncertainty.",
