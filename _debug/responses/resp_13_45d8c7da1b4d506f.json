    "Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in California, drawing criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom over a live artillery demonstration on a busy highway.",
    "The demonstration, which included fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels, and live fire from a towed howitzer, was described by Vance’s office as a routine, safe military training exercise.",
    "Governor Gavin Newsom closed a section of Interstate 5 citing extreme life safety risks, calling the live firing 'dangerous' and 'wrong', especially during high-traffic conditions.",
    "Vance, the first Marine to serve as vice president, emphasized military unity and common purpose over diversity, aligning with the Trump administration's pushback against 'woke' diversity initiatives in the military.",
    "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Vance’s message, arguing that military strength comes from unity, not diversity.",
    "The event occurred during a period of government shutdown, and Vance attributed the shutdown to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, while affirming that the Department of Defense continues to pay troops using unobligated funds.",
    "The incident reflects a broader political and ideological conflict between the Trump administration and Democratic leaders over military culture, funding, and public safety."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large-scale live artillery demonstration involving fighter jets, helicopters, and naval vessels. The event drew strong opposition from Governor Gavin Newsom, who closed a section of Interstate 5 due to safety concerns, calling the live fire dangerous and distracting to drivers. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the demonstration as routine military training and emphasized unity of purpose over diversity, aligning with the Trump administration’s broader campaign against 'woke' initiatives in the military. The event also occurred amid a government shutdown, with Vance blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the disruption and affirming that military personnel continue to be paid through unobligated funds. The incident highlights a growing political and ideological divide between the administration and Democratic leaders on issues of military culture, public safety, and government operations.",
