  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump’s response to the massive 'No Kings' protests — including AI-generated memes portraying him as a king — is interpreted as evidence of his growing belief in unchecked presidential power and contempt for democratic norms. The article highlights how Trump’s actions, such as pardoning George Santos and authorizing military strikes and covert operations abroad, are seen as unconstitutional and authoritarian. These actions, coupled with dismissive rhetoric toward protesters and the public, reinforce concerns that the U.S. is moving toward a more autocratic presidency. Meanwhile, millions of Americans participated in peaceful protests, asserting that democracy and free speech are under threat, and signaling a rising wave of resistance to what many perceive as a breakdown of constitutional governance.",
