  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A government shutdown that has lasted for 20 days and is expected to continue through Thanksgiving has deepened political division in the U.S. Congress, with Democrats demanding the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent soaring health insurance costs, while Republicans refuse to negotiate until the government reopens, citing flaws in the ACA system and calling for reform. President Donald Trump is absent from key negotiations, with Democratic leaders criticizing his lack of engagement. Both parties have escalated political games, including blocking House members' return and delaying swearing-in of new Democratic officials. Federal workers—including nuclear specialists and air traffic controllers—are being furloughed or fired, and critical programs like nutrition support for 42 million Americans face expiration. Despite Republican proposals to reopen with short-term funding and to pay essential workers, Democrats oppose any move that allows Trump to selectively fund employees. The situation reflects a broader failure of bipartisan leadership, with neither side moving beyond blame and the cycle of political deadlock continuing.",
