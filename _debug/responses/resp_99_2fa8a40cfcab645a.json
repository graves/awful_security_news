  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, around 3:50 a.m. local time, and crashed into the sea, killing two airport staff in a security patrol vehicle. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact, with significant damage to the front section. Despite no distress signals being reported, the aircraft was not in distress during approach. Four crew members were injured and taken to hospitals. The airport suspended operations on the north runway while emergency teams, including over 200 personnel and boats, responded. Historical context includes a 1999 crash at HKIA involving a China Airlines flight, which underscores the rarity of such incidents. This event highlights ongoing aviation safety concerns and the complexity of international flight operations involving wet-leasing arrangements.",
