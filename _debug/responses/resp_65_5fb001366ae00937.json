  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has filed two major legal motions to dismiss federal charges of lying and obstructing Congress, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His legal team claims that Trump personally targeted Comey due to public criticism, citing a pattern of personal attacks and statements demonstrating retaliatory intent. Additionally, they argue that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—after the 120-day term limit for interim appointments had expired—violates the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause by circumventing Senate confirmation, and reference the earlier dismissal of Trump’s own indictment by special counsel Jack Smith as precedent. The case raises significant constitutional and political questions about executive overreach, protected speech, and the legitimacy of prosecutorial actions in response to political dissent.",
