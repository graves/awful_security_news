  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, seeking authorization to deploy the National Guard in Chicago amid claims of violent threats to federal personnel and property. The administration argues that lower courts, including the 7th Circuit, improperly blocked the deployment by overstating the danger and encroaching on presidential authority, citing the 1827 Supreme Court decision in Martin v. Mott, which asserts that only the president can determine whether a national emergency exists. In contrast, state officials and judges like April Perry argue that protests are not violent riots and that courts should have the power to review such decisions, referencing the 1932 case Sterling v. Constantin. The case is significant because it tests the boundaries of presidential power in deploying the military domestically and may set a precedent for future emergency deployments. The Supreme Court, which has previously sided with Trump in similar emergencies, is now being asked to quickly rule on the matter, with a request for responses from state and local officials by Monday evening.",
