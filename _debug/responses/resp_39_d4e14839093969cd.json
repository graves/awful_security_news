  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has lifted a 38-plane-per-month production cap on Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, allowing the company to increase output to 42 planes per month. This decision follows a 2024 mid-air emergency involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that was missing four critical bolts, which raised safety concerns and led to the initial production cap. The FAA conducted extensive safety reviews of Boeing’s production lines to ensure the increased output can be managed safely. Boeing's CEO Kelly Ortberg and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford were involved in confirming the production increase, and Boeing emphasized that safety and quality remain central to the new production goals. This milestone marks a significant step in restoring confidence in the 737 MAX program and the broader aviation industry.",
