  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris announced a closure following a rapid and brazen heist on October 19, 2025, where thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery via a window using a truck-mounted ladder and tools like an angle grinder and blowtorch, stealing high-value historical jewelry from the French crown jewels. The stolen items include a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise. Experts, including French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and Senate member Natalie Goulet, believe the items have likely been taken abroad and destroyed or sold on the black market for money laundering. The incident is seen as a profound cultural blow to France, exposing significant security flaws such as unsecured windows and public access to equipment. Past heists, including the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 Corot painting theft, are referenced to illustrate a long-standing vulnerability in museum security. Experts warn that the jewelry may be melted down or recut, meaning the items may never be recovered or restored to their original form.",
