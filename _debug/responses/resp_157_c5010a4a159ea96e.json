The incident has deepened political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition and media of inciting violence while pushing a more authoritarian and pro-Russian stance, and criticizing EU policies. The case has sparked national debate over political extremism, government accountability, and democratic erosion, especially in light of recent constitutional changes limiting same-sex rights and asserting national law over EU law.",
