  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A surge in AI-powered voice cloning has enabled sophisticated fraud, as demonstrated by a scam in which fraudsters used AI to mimic the voice of Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, successfully deceiving wealthy businessmen into transferring money. The scam, which occurred in February 2025, targeted prominent figures including Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, with only Massimo Moratti transferring funds. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are nearly indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants more likely to trust them than authentic voices. Global losses from deepfake scams reached over $547 million between January and June 2025, and concerns have grown over AI's use in creating non-consensual sexual content, including child exploitation material. In response, the US and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize such content, highlighting the urgent need for public awareness, regulation, and technological safeguards.",
