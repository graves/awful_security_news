  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) have been shown to modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. Infected ants self-isolate, while healthy ants—especially nurses caring for the queen, eggs, and larvae—increase their distance from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing. When exposed to the fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and wider nest entrances, which reduces disease transmission. These structural changes complement social behaviors, creating a dual defense mechanism. The study, conducted by Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie and published in Science, represents the first documented case of non-human social species actively altering their environment’s spatial structure in response to disease threats. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest that these natural strategies could inspire the design of human public spaces to better prevent disease spread, offering a novel form of 'architectural immunity'.",
