  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a gun and drugs. The government argues that habitual drug use poses a public safety risk, particularly during impaired encounters with law enforcement, and that the law is historically justified. However, a lower court ruled that such a ban must have historical roots, and only applies to those under the influence at the time of arrest. The 5th Circuit upheld that precedent, leading the Trump administration to appeal. Hemani’s legal team challenges the historical basis of the law, noting that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana, creating a significant overlap between legal drug use and gun ownership. The case is part of a broader Supreme Court term examining gun rights, including a separate case on state-imposed gun bans on private property. The Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025.",
