  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using titles such as Duke of York in response to mounting public and political pressure, following revelations of his prolonged contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations from Giuffre, who claims she had sexual encounters with him when she was 17. Despite this, he still technically holds the title granted by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and remains a prince by birth. The controversy intensified after Giuffre's memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' was released, in which she alleges Andrew treated her as if sex with her was a 'birthright' and claims his team tried to hire online trolls to silence her. A 2022 out-of-court settlement was reached, with Andrew acknowledging Giuffre’s suffering without admitting wrongdoing. Politicians such as Stephen Flynn have called for legislative action to strip both Andrew and Peter Mandelson of their titles, citing public outrage and victimization. The government maintains that such actions fall outside constitutional authority, and the monarchy remains insulated from political interference. Questions also persist about the cost of Prince Andrew’s residence at Royal Lodge, which he rents from the Crown Estate, and about his potential involvement in attempts to discredit Giuffre in 2011, which is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police.",
