  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during arrival from Dubai around 3:50 a.m. local time. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact and collided with an airport security patrol car, resulting in the deaths of two staff members in the vehicle. The aircraft sustained severe damage, with the tail section broken off and the front section heavily damaged, though all four crew members were treated and survived. No distress signals were sent by the pilots. The airport suspended operations on the north runway until the aircraft is removed, though other runways remain operational, minimizing disruption to over 1,000 daily flights. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, which provides cargo capacity to major airlines like Emirates. The incident is notable given HKIA’s strong safety record, with the last major crash occurring in 1999 at the former Kai Tak Airport, historically regarded as one of the world’s most difficult airports for landings.",
