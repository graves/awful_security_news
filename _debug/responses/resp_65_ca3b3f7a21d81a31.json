  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition — to fund the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision was made to prevent the program from shutting down within a week or two due to lack of appropriations. While the White House claims executive authority to reallocate funds, experts and advocacy groups question the legal and procedural validity of such a move, citing that Congress has not formally authorized the use of these funds. The National WIC Association stressed the need for long-term stability, not just short-term fixes. WIC, which enjoys bipartisan support, has become a political flashpoint, with Republican leaders blaming Democrats for the shutdown. Despite the intervention, concerns remain over the amount, speed, and duration of funding, especially as the program’s future funding depends on upcoming legislation that could either maintain or reduce support.",
