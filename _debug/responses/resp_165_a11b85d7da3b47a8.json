  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of sophisticated AI voice scams targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, using deepfake technology to impersonate Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam, which occurred shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, exploited the growing realism of AI-generated voices—research shows that 58% of cloned voices are indistinguishable from real human speech, and participants often perceive AI voices as more trustworthy. Only former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti sent money, prompting a legal complaint. The fraud reflects a broader global trend, with over $547 million lost globally to deepfake scams from January to June 2025, and rising concerns over AI-generated child sexual abuse material. Governments like the US and Australia are responding with new laws to criminalize such misuse, highlighting both the dangers and the ethical challenges of advanced AI voice technology.",
