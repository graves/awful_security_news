The deal, which requires strict security measures including nationality eligibility, background checks, and Belize’s authority to approve transfers, is promoted by Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño as a targeted economic opportunity for Central American migrants. However, it has drawn strong criticism from human rights groups and Belize's opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton, who warn of potential harm, financial strain, and violations of national sovereignty. The agreement follows a broader U.S. strategy under President Donald Trump, supported by a Supreme Court decision that allows deportations to third countries without prior risk assessments, and mirrors similar arrangements with Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras.",
