  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays, after a hard-fought seven-game victory over the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, have advanced to the 2025 World Series for the first time since 1993. Their opponent is the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have won two World Series titles and five National League pennants in the past nine years, and are the defending champions. The Dodgers' postseason run was dominant, including a key performance by Shohei Ohtani, who recorded three home runs and a shutout in Game 4 of the NLCS. Despite a shaky regular season, the Dodgers excelled in the postseason, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers. The Blue Jays, who turned around from a last-place finish in 2024, overcame the Yankees in the ALDS and narrowly avoided elimination in the ALCS. The series will begin on Friday, October 24, in Toronto, with the Blue Jays' offensive strength and defensive resilience posing a challenge to the Dodgers' otherwise dominant team, especially given the Dodgers' bullpen weakness.",
