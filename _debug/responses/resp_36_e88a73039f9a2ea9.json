  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was marked by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and significant coaching changes. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit against the New York Giants, with second-year quarterback Bo Nix delivering a career-defining performance that included a final game-winning field goal. Meanwhile, Drake Maye of the New England Patriots broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate in a dominant 31-13 win over the Tennessee Titans, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush over 50 yards in a single game. On the flip side, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets both suffered major losses, with Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields being benched due to poor performances, respectively. The Jets' first-year coach Aaron Glenn admitted the team needed a spark, while the Dolphins’ coaching staff turned to rookie Quinn Ewers. The week underscored the NFL’s volatility, with teams showing both resilience and fragility, and highlighted a broader theme of late-game comebacks being more frequent than ever in NFL history.",
