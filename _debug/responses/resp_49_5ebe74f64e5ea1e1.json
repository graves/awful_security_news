  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro has sparked widespread anxiety among Colombians, who fear economic consequences such as job losses, business failures, and visa restrictions due to Trump’s threats to cut subsidies and raise tariffs. As the United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner—accounting for 30% of its exports—such measures could severely impact key industries like coffee, flowers, and manufactured goods. Petro responded to Trump’s accusations of drug production by calling the remarks rude and ignorant, while also facing a revoked visa for criticizing US actions in the Caribbean and advocating for pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The conflict highlights not only the personal hostility between the leaders but also deeper concerns about drug trafficking, economic vulnerability, and the lack of progress on the drug issue in Colombia, with both citizens and officials expressing that the real problem remains unsolved.",
