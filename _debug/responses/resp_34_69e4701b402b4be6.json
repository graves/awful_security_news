  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been abandoned, with officials stating there are no immediate plans for a meeting. The shift follows a recent phone call where Trump expressed urgency, but subsequent diplomatic efforts — including a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov — revealed divergent positions on ending the war in Ukraine, especially due to Ukraine’s lack of long-range missile capabilities. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date was set, so it cannot be postponed, while a European diplomat notes Lavrov is not involved in key decisions, only loyal to Putin. The Trump administration now sees such calls as sufficient for gauging Russian positions, deeming a high-level meeting unnecessary. Despite the halt in direct Trump-Putin talks, the U.S. remains committed to brokering peace, and Ukraine’s leadership emphasizes that long-range missile support is a critical factor in Russia’s willingness to negotiate. Future discussions between Rubio and Lavrov may occur at an ASEAN summit in Malaysia, signaling continued diplomatic efforts.",
