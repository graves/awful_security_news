  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies, particularly Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), for allegedly violating her court order restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests. The controversy stems from Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led immigration crackdown in Chicagoland that resulted in over 1,000 arrests between September 8 and October 3, 2025. Judge Ellis expressed serious concerns after seeing images and reports indicating tear gas deployment without prior warning, and has mandated that all CBP agents wear body-worn cameras to improve transparency. Officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, denying reports of unauthorized tear gas use. However, the judge remains unconvinced and has ordered the deposition of Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino, the former ICE head in Chicago and a CBP patrol agent, respectively, to obtain full accountability. Ongoing protests at the Broadview ICE facility, with multiple arrests reported, underscore community resistance to enforcement actions, while federal officials continue to downplay or deny allegations of misconduct.",
