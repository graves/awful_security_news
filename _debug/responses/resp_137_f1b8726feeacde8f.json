Andrés Fernando Tufiño, an Ecuadorian national, was released by Ecuadorian authorities after prosecutors found no evidence linking him to drug trafficking in the country. A Colombian citizen, also a survivor, remains hospitalized and will be prosecuted by Colombia. The U.S. claims the vessel carried fentanyl, though there is limited evidence of such drug production in the Andes. The actions have sparked significant diplomatic tensions, particularly between the U.S. and Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of killing a citizen and called out President Trump as a 'drug leader'. In response, Colombia recalled its ambassador, while Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa reaffirmed the country’s commitment to global anti-drug efforts and called for international unity. Trump justified the strikes as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, invoking post-9/11 legal frameworks, which has drawn international criticism.",
