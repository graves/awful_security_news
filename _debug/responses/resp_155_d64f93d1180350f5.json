  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, citing internal disagreements over Gaza policy, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his support for a partial peace deal with Hamas. Hanegbi, who served as NSC head since 2023, publicly admitted personal responsibility for the failures leading to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which Netanyahu’s government has yet to establish. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accused the government of evading accountability. As a result, Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, has been appointed as acting head of the NSC, marking a significant shift in Israel’s security leadership and signaling growing political tensions over the Gaza conflict and post-October 7 response.",
