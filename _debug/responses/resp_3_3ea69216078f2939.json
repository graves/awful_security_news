  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport during arrival from Dubai around 3:50 a.m. local time, breaking in two and crashing into the sea. The aircraft struck an airport security patrol car, killing two occupants. The four crew members were injured but treated and released. Despite no distress signals being sent, the incident caused significant damage to the aircraft, prompting a large emergency response involving over 200 people, fire engines, and boats. The airport temporarily suspended operations on its north runway, though other runways remain operational, minimizing flight disruptions. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, which provides cargo capacity to major airlines like Emirates. This event, though rare at Hong Kong’s busy airport, reflects ongoing safety challenges, especially considering the historical context of past aviation incidents at the region’s former Kai Tak Airport.",
