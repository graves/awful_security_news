  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from 20 of the nation’s largest cities, has issued a public statement urging widespread vaccination in response to growing political misinformation and changes in federal vaccine guidelines. The coalition expresses deep concern over false claims by federal officials—including former President Donald Trump—about vaccine safety and dosage, as well as a recent CDC advisory to remove the MMRV vaccine from the schedule for children under 4. These developments have contributed to declining public trust in the CDC, with a KFF poll showing only half of U.S. adults now trusting the agency. The article highlights a measles outbreak in South Carolina, affecting over 100 unvaccinated students, as a tangible consequence of low vaccination rates. City officials emphasize that public health must be grounded in science, not political ideology, and that regional cooperation is essential to prevent disease spread across state lines. They call for consistent, evidence-based messaging and warn that without coordinated action, public health systems remain vulnerable to outbreaks and misinformation.",
