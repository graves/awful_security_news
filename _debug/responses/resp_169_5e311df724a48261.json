  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on October 20, 2025, began at 07:11 GMT due to a technical error during a DynamoDB API update that caused a DNS failure. This disrupted access to 113 AWS services, including popular platforms such as Snapchat, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, Starbucks, and financial apps like Venmo and Coinbase. The failure also impacted media organizations, gaming services, smart home devices like Ring and Alexa, and AI services such as Perplexity. Despite the widespread disruption, AWS engineers resolved the issue by 10:11 GMT, with some minor delays in message processing. Experts emphasize that such outages are typically due to human error, not cyberattacks, and highlight the critical dependency of modern digital services on cloud infrastructure. The incident underscores the fragility and interconnectedness of today’s internet ecosystem, even as AWS maintains a dominant 30% market share and strong recovery capabilities.",
