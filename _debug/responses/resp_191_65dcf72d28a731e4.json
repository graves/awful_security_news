Despite Prince Andrew’s public pledge to give up titles, critics argue that the Palace’s response has been inadequate, and calls are growing for Parliament to remove him from the line of succession or strip him of titles. The period from the late 1990s to 2019, when Andrew was a working royal, is under renewed review, with questions about what royal officials might have known. The Metropolitan Police are investigating allegations of inappropriate conduct, and the Royal Household has supported the inquiry. The article underscores a broader concern about institutional transparency, accountability, and the need for stronger legal mechanisms to hold royal figures accountable, especially in light of historical connections with Epstein and abuse networks.",
