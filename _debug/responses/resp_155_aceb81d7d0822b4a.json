  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Muqtada al-Sadr, a prominent Iraqi Shia leader, has pursued a long-term strategy to undermine the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF) by boycotting elections and leveraging public mobilization, aiming to form a 'national majority' government on his terms. After withdrawing his bloc from parliament in 2022, he initially engaged in back-channel negotiations with the government, only to withdraw again after the SCF rejected a registration extension. His movement, rebranded as the Patriotic Shia Current, has sought alliances with Sunni and Kurdish parties, including Mohammed al-Halbousi and the KDP, to build a coalition outside SCF control. Despite winning 73 seats in 2021, the government formation effort failed when the Federal Supreme Court raised the quorum threshold, enabling the SCF to form an 'obstructing third'. Al-Sadr has since used street protests and public outreach—particularly during Ashura—to maintain visibility and political momentum. Meanwhile, the SCF has strengthened its dominance, removing key Sadrist officials and facing accusations of judicial politicization. As Iraq faces deepening economic crisis, U.S. sanctions, and Israeli threats, al-Sadr's strategy of strategic withdrawal and public pressure positions him as a potential power broker in the event of political collapse.",
