  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recent Russian drone and air attack on Ukraine’s Chernihiv and Sumy regions, at least four civilians were killed and over 10 injured, including a 10-year-old child. The strikes destroyed power infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity or water, and local officials accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure to inflict suffering during winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia’s tactics as murderous and terrorizing, while U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed delivery of Tomahawk missiles and a planned meeting with Vladimir Putin were canceled due to lack of official scheduling. The Russian government denied any imminent summit, and international leaders, including the European Union, reaffirmed that Ukraine must not be forced to surrender territory in return for peace. This incident underscores the ongoing humanitarian and geopolitical impact of the war, as well as the persistent efforts to seek diplomatic solutions amid military aggression.",
