    "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has recommended that a judge resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, to life with the possibility of parole — a recommendation based on new evidence of abuse by their father and the brothers’ rehabilitation while incarcerated.",
    "The brothers have been serving life without parole since 1996, but under California law, they may now be eligible for youthful parole due to being under 26 at the time of the crime.",

    "Gascón’s decision follows a 2023 habeas corpus petition and a new California law allowing resentencing to consider psychological and physical abuse, rehabilitation, and danger to society.",
    "The decision has been met with public and political support, including from celebrity advocate Kim Kardashian and family members such as Jose Menendez’s niece Anamaria Baralt, who called it 'brave and necessary'.",
    "The case has gained renewed attention due to the Netflix series 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story' and associated documentaries, increasing public awareness and interest in criminal justice reform."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has announced he will recommend a resentencing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in 1989. The decision, made after a 2023 habeas petition citing new evidence of physical and sexual abuse by their father, including a sworn statement from Roy Rosselló and a letter from Erik Menendez, reflects changes in societal and legal views on trauma and self-defense. Gascón argues that both brothers have rehabilitated, have contributed positively to prison life, and are now eligible for youthful parole under California law. The recommendation is supported by public figures like Kim Kardashian and Jose Menendez’s niece, Anamaria Baralt, and has been fueled by renewed media interest from the Netflix series and documentary. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge will ultimately decide whether to resentence the brothers, with a hearing expected in 30 to 45 days.",
