  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, 57, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, when his Cirrus SR22T aircraft entered a tightening spiral after failing to maintain proper radio communication with air traffic control. The NTSB's preliminary report found no mechanical issues, indicating that the incident likely stemmed from a communication error — James never changed from his initial frequency despite being instructed to tune to the common traffic advisory frequency. He had requested a visual approach to runway 7, which was approved, but his failure to communicate his position after that led to a loss of contact. The crash occurred in Franklin, North Carolina, about 270 miles southeast of Nashville, killing all three people on board. James was a highly respected songwriter who collaborated with major artists like Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, notably co-writing 'Out Last Night' and 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' for Carrie Underwood. His death raises concerns about safety protocols in general aviation and the importance of adherence to standard flight communication practices.",
