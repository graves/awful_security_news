  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Coca-Cola has begun rolling out a soda made with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in select U.S. cities and retailers, following President Donald Trump’s demand earlier in 2025 for the company to make the switch. The move responds to advocacy by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has criticized high-fructose corn syrup as unhealthy. While health experts note that sugar-filled soda is not healthy regardless of sweetener, the shift reflects Coca-Cola’s broader strategy to offer healthier alternatives, including the success of sugar-free products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and the relaunch of BodyArmor and bottled water brand Smartwater. This development highlights the intersection of political pressure, public health concerns, and corporate product innovation.",
