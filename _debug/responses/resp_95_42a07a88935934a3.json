  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 16, 2025, the United States conducted a military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, resulting in survivors—marking the first such operation not to instantly kill all on board. This shift from previous strikes, which were fatal, reflects a broader change in strategy, possibly enabled by a classified legal opinion from the Trump administration that allows the president to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and authorize summary killings without due process. The operation is part of a broader effort to combat drug trafficking in the region, with the CIA authorized to operate in Venezuela to disrupt illegal flows. The incident, first reported by Reuters, has prompted questions about executive power, legal boundaries, and the transition from traditional interdiction (led by the Coast Guard) to military action. While the Defense Department remained silent, the White House has been contacted for comment, signaling ongoing public and political scrutiny.",
