  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A significant rise in car loan delinquency among subprime borrowers—those with credit scores below 670—is signaling deep economic distress in the U.S. The rate has doubled since 2021, reaching 6.43%, and surpasses levels seen during past recessions. This surge is driven by record car prices, high interest rates, rising repair and insurance costs, and the resumption of student loan payments after pandemic pauses. Subprime borrowers face severe financial stress, often having missed payments on other debts, and many are forced into default or repossession. In contrast, prime borrowers with better credit scores remain largely unaffected. The situation reflects a 'K-shaped economy' where wealthier individuals thrive while lower-income consumers struggle. Lenders are now using GPS tracking and ignition disabling to recover vehicles, indicating a level of repossession activity similar to the Great Recession. Economists warn that a weakening labor market could worsen this trend, underscoring a growing divide in economic well-being across the U.S. population.",
