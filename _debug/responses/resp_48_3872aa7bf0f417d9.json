    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its extreme cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes from the Culiseta annulata species.",
    "The mosquitoes were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who spotted and collected one during dusk on October 16.",
    "The discovery was confirmed by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson of the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, who identified the species and captured three individuals — two females and one male.",
    "Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing adults to survive freezing winters in sheltered environments.",
    "While the exact origin of the mosquitoes in Iceland is unclear, theories include arrival via ships or containers.",
    "The discovery raises questions about climate change's role in expanding mosquito habitats, though experts remain cautious, noting that the presence of mosquitoes in cold regions may not be solely due to warming.",
    "Iceland has already experienced record-breaking heat due to climate change, increasing the possibility of mosquito establishment in the future.",
    "Experts, including Colin J. Carlson from Yale University, caution that climate change may not be the direct cause, and that more research is needed to understand shifts in mosquito range under warming conditions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long known for its extreme cold and mosquito-free environment, has confirmed its first wild mosquito discovery — a female and male of the Culiseta annulata species — found in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. The finding, initially reported by resident Björn Hjaltason and confirmed by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift. Culiseta annulata is adapted to cold climates and can survive winter in sheltered environments, possibly arriving via ships or containers. While climate change may have increased the likelihood of such species establishing in Iceland, experts remain cautious, noting that similar mosquito ranges exist in Scandinavia and that the link to global warming is not definitively proven. The discovery underscores broader concerns about climate-driven shifts in species distribution and raises questions about future public health risks as temperatures rise globally.",
