  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective weapon used in multiple conflicts including Iraq, Syria, and Libya, is being considered by Ukraine for deep strikes into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested its delivery to counter Russian military infrastructure, including the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov. However, the US has limited stockpiles and prioritizes domestic use, with President Donald Trump stating that Tomahawks are needed for American security. Russia has raised alarm, warning that supplying the missiles would be seen as a hostile act and threaten global stability, citing nuclear capabilities. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch system (Typhon) to deploy Tomahawks, and its own cruise missile program (Flamingo) remains unproven and underdeveloped. While the Tomahawk offers superior firepower and precision compared to Ukrainian drones, Ukraine's immediate military needs remain centered on improved air defenses. Despite these challenges, the potential for Tomahawk strikes could shift the strategic balance in the war, forcing Russia to reconsider its position at the negotiating table.",
