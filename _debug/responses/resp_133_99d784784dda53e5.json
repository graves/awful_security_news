Her rise follows a fragile coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, which lacks a parliamentary majority and raises concerns about political instability. Takaichi emphasizes strong national defense, the Japan-U.S. alliance, and a hawkish foreign policy, including support for Taiwan and visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Despite her historic gender milestone, she has not advanced gender equality or LGBTQ+ rights, drawing criticism from activists and regional partners. Her leadership will be tested by diplomatic tensions with China and South Korea, economic challenges, and the need to pass legislation amid a fragile coalition. International actors, including the U.S. and EU, have acknowledged her historic appointment and expressed interest in continued cooperation.",
