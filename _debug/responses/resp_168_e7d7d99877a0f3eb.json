  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark trial in Los Angeles is set to begin in January 2025, requiring top executives from Meta (Mark Zuckerberg, Adam Mosseri) and Snap (Evan Spiegel) to testify in person, after Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that their personal knowledge of platform design and business decisions is essential to proving negligence. The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts accusing social media companies of designing addictive features—like like alerts—that exploit young users and ignore known mental health risks. Despite arguments that federal law protects them from liability for user content, the judge found that the companies' failure to implement safeguards constitutes negligence. The trial is among the first to hold such platforms legally responsible for harm caused by their app designs, marking a pivotal moment in legal and public scrutiny of social media's impact on youth.",
