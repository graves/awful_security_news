  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen prosecuted for marijuana and cocaine use and firearm possession. The Trump administration argues that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, especially when impaired, and that the law is historically grounded. However, a lower court ruled that such a ban lacks historical precedent, and the 5th Circuit affirmed this, leading to the appeal. The case raises broader questions about the Second Amendment, historical justification for gun restrictions, and the balance between public safety and constitutional rights. Notably, President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned, adding political and public significance. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026.",
