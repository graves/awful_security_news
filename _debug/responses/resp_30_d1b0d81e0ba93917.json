  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians have jointly called on the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a $200 million, privately funded ballroom. The East Wing, which has been a key historical and social feature since 1942, includes spaces used by the first lady and is central to the White House's architectural balance. Preservationists argue that the proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would disrupt the classical design of the building and lacks required public review processes, including input from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. Despite Trump’s assertion that the project is a necessary and visionary expansion, the lack of transparency and public engagement has sparked widespread concern. Previous presidential renovations, such as those under Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, are cited as historical precedents, but the current project is being challenged for its scale and procedural bypassing of established preservation standards.",
