  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the dramatic rise in orange juice prices in the UK — from 76p to £1.79 per litre in just five years — as a case study for broader grocery inflation. This spike is driven by a confluence of factors: citrus greening disease and extreme weather in key producing nations like Brazil and Florida, trade tensions and tariffs (especially US tariffs on Brazilian orange juice), and new packaging regulations. As a result, manufacturers have substituted oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins and mangoes. The situation reflects a global pattern of rising food costs, with similar increases in beef, butter, and milk. Despite efforts by retailers like Aldi to pass on savings, the market’s concentration in a few large producers and supply chain fragility mean prices are likely to remain high. The article raises broader concerns about the UK’s food security and long-term vulnerability due to its heavy reliance on imported, climate-sensitive food supplies.",
