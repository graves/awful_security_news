  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank, banning UNRWA from operating and de-registering major non-governmental organizations (INGOs) under new ideological criteria. These measures, including requiring approval from a committee that includes representatives from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, target organizations deemed to support 'terrorist activities' or incite 'racism,' often based on broad interpretations of antisemitism. Aid groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps have been denied access or de-registered, with many facing a 60-day shutdown. Despite a ceasefire agreement brokered by President Trump that promised increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, and most aid requests are rejected without explanation. Humanitarian officials report that over 90% of Gaza’s homes have been destroyed, and UNRWA has thousands of food and medical supplies stored in Egypt and Jordan, unable to be delivered. The U.S. withdrawal of funding to UNRWA has also weakened its capacity, and international bodies have criticized Israel’s lack of evidence for accusations against UNRWA. This situation threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank, with major aid operations being systematically undermined.",
