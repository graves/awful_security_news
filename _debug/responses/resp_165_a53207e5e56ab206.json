  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-generated voice scams targeting wealthy Italian businessmen began in early 2025, with fraudsters cloning the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request large financial transfers. The scam, which also involved fake calls from a 'General' and requests for personal information, was exposed after Crosetto publicly denied receiving such calls. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are nearly indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often rating them as more trustworthy. The global rise in deepfake fraud—over $547 million lost between January and June 2025—has led to urgent policy responses, including US federal laws criminalizing AI-generated intimate imagery and Australia banning apps used to create deepfakes. While AI voice technology offers positive applications such as restoring speech for the disabled, its misuse for identity theft, fraud, and the creation of illegal content, especially child sexual abuse material, poses serious societal risks.",
