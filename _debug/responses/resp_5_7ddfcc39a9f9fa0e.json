  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris experienced a brazen daylight heist in October 2025, during which thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery and stole high-value jewelry, damaging the crown of Empress Eugénie. The incident, which took just seven minutes, highlights long-standing security weaknesses identified in a 2019–2024 Court of Auditors report that criticized outdated technical systems and poor operational implementation. This robbery is part of a broader pattern of issues at the museum, including overcrowding, water leaks, temperature fluctuations, and inadequate staffing, as warned by Louvre President Laurence des Cars in 2019. The museum's historical vulnerability is further underscored by past thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia and the 1983 disappearance of 16th-century armor. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to give the Mona Lisa a dedicated exhibition space as part of a major renovation expected to last up to ten years.",
