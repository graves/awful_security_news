  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th-anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live-fire demonstration involving artillery firing over the I-5 interstate highway, a route not used since the 1950s. A 155mm shell from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated mid-air, sending fragments that struck and damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. Though no injuries occurred, the incident raised safety concerns, especially given the shell had previously been used successfully in training. The event was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who defended it as a standard, safe practice. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the exercise as 'dangerous' and ordered the highway closure. The incident has prompted a Marine Corps investigation into the specific shell batch and its manufacturing origin, with concerns raised about a 2024 Reuters investigation that found issues such as cracked shells and a temporary shift to a less-accident-prone explosive. The US has significantly increased 155mm shell production since 2022 to meet Ukraine’s demand in its war with Russia, contributing to a broader context of safety and production reliability questions.",
