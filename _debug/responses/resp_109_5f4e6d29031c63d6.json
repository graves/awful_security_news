    "Many engineers report that AI does not significantly boost overall productivity, with some studies showing actual task completion times increased by 19% due to errors or inefficiencies.",
    "The use of AI is often driven by management pressure rather than need, leading to what engineers call 'workslaps' — where AI is used unnecessarily, creating messy, unreviewable code.",
    "A significant portion of software engineers (30% or more) do not trust AI-generated code, citing concerns about long-term job displacement, high energy consumption, and lack of true problem-solving capability.",
    "AI tools are most effective in low-stakes, rapid prototyping tasks, not in complex, high-level system design or innovation.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tech CEOs from major companies like Anthropic, Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are promoting AI's ability to write a significant portion of software code, claiming it will revolutionize development. However, software engineers remain skeptical, citing mixed results in productivity, frequent AI-generated code errors, and unproductive misuse — such as 'workslaps' where AI is used unnecessarily. While AI excels at rapid prototyping and repetitive tasks, experts like Simon Willison and Boris Cherny emphasize that human review and oversight are essential, especially for complex problem-solving. Studies from METR and Denmark show AI delivers only modest, sometimes negative, productivity gains. Additionally, concerns about job displacement for junior engineers, environmental impact, and lack of trust in AI outputs persist. Despite aggressive corporate rhetoric, AI remains a tool that supports, not replaces, human software engineering expertise.",
