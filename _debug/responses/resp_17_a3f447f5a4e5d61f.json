  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a federal government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers are going unpaid, while lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, and certain essential staff continue to receive pay due to constitutional or legislative provisions. The Trump administration has temporarily protected military personnel and 70,000 DHS law enforcement employees, including FBI agents, from pay cuts. Approximately 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, and 670,000 are furloughed, with some agencies like the IRS changing their pay plans mid-shutdown. A proposed bill by Senate GOP leaders to pay certain essential workers has drawn resistance from Democrats, who demand universal coverage. The White House is challenging the 2019 law that guarantees back pay for furloughed employees, raising concerns about equity and financial stability for federal workers. Many federal workers face severe hardship, with risks of losing homes or jobs, and federal contractors have no compensation guarantee. The shutdown underscores a deep divide in who is protected and who is not, highlighting structural flaws in how federal funding and pay are managed during political disputes.",
