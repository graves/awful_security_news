Workers fear that even scheduled sick or vacation leave could be treated as 'absent without leave' or result in disciplinary actions, with furlough notices being stored in personnel records under 'disciplinary and adverse actions' — a practice not seen before. The Trump administration has also threatened mass layoffs and challenged the 2019 law ensuring retroactive pay for furloughed employees, while a federal judge has temporarily blocked recent reductions in force (RIF) notices, citing them as unlawful. Employees report receiving conflicting guidance from supervisors, with some being told they could be terminated for absence. Union leaders and experts argue this is a harmful escalation of mistreatment, piling risk on workers already burdened by job insecurity and health concerns.",
