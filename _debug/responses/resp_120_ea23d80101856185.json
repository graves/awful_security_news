  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a lightning-fast military coup on October 17, 2025, Madagascar’s army colonel Michael Randrianirina seized power by taking control of the High Constitutional Court, where he was sworn in as president. The move followed three weeks of youth-led protests over water and electricity shortages, corruption, and lack of opportunity, which had led to at least 22 deaths. Randrianirina, a former prisoner of an attempted mutiny, claimed the takeover was necessary to save the nation and promised military rule for 18 to 24 months before elections. The ousted President Andry Rajoelina fled into hiding, reportedly on a French military plane. The United Nations and African Union condemned the coup as unconstitutional, with the AU suspending Madagascar. Analysts question whether the military exploited the youth uprising to gain power, and there is growing international concern over the erosion of democratic norms in the country.",
