  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), over their use of force during protests tied to Trump administration's Operation Midway Blitz. The operation, which began on September 8 and concluded on October 3, resulted in over 1,000 arrests and sparked sustained protests at the Broadview ICE facility. Judge Ellis issued a restraining order requiring body-worn cameras, prohibiting the use of tear gas and less-lethal munitions without warning, and asserting that the agencies may be violating these directives. In response, federal officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, denying reports of tear gas deployment without warning and stating that agents are complying with camera mandates. However, the judge expressed significant concern that her order is not being followed, and has ordered the depositions of Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino—key figures in the field—despite Hott’s departure from Chicago. Protests continue at Broadview, with multiple arrests reported, indicating ongoing public resistance to immigration enforcement actions.",
