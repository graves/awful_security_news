    "Iceland, historically free from wild mosquitoes due to its extreme cold, has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, western Iceland.",
    "This marks the first known record of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment, distinct from a previous isolated case involving a single mosquito found on a plane in 1990s-era.",
    "The Culiseta annulata species is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing it to survive freezing winters in sheltered areas.",
    "Possible introduction routes include ships or cargo containers, though the exact mechanism remains unknown.",
    "Climate change is a contributing factor under discussion, as rising temperatures may allow mosquitoes to expand into new regions, but experts remain cautious about directly linking this discovery to global warming.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson suggest that mosquito ranges may shift naturally in extreme northern regions, independent of climate change, and that long-term data are needed to confirm patterns.",
    "As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes—especially disease-carrying ones—are expanding their range, which raises public health and ecological concerns worldwide."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long protected by its extreme cold from wild mosquitoes, has confirmed the first natural occurrence of the mosquito species Culiseta annulata in Kiðafell, western Iceland, after being spotted by resident Björn Hjaltason in October 2025. The species, native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere, is believed to have arrived via ships or containers, and scientists are monitoring whether it can survive the winter and establish in the wild. While climate change is considered a potential enabling factor due to rising temperatures, experts remain cautious, noting that similar mosquito expansions have already occurred in northern Scandinavia, suggesting natural range shifts may be occurring independently of warming. This discovery underscores the broader global trend of mosquitoes expanding into new areas as climate change progresses, raising concerns about public health and ecological balance.",
