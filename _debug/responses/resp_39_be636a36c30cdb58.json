  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, a woman reported missing in Philadelphia after an overnight shift at an assisted living facility, were discovered behind an abandoned school. An anonymous tip prompted investigators to re-examine the site, where they found her remains in a shallow grave, confirmed by DNA testing. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and other offenses. Evidence including cellphone location data and video footage of a stolen black Hyundai Accent—seen at a recreation center the night she went missing—links King to her disappearance. The vehicle later caught fire and was destroyed at a junkyard, raising suspicion. Prosecutors believe others may have been involved and are still investigating. While homicide charges are expected, District Attorney Larry Krasner emphasized legal procedures. King has a prior criminal record involving a similar kidnapping case, which was dropped due to lack of witness appearance. Scott’s parents described her as a source of kindness and light, and their grief underscores the personal impact of the case.",
