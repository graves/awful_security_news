  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies after detecting evidence that agents during Operation Midway Blitz—Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicagoland—violated her order to limit the use of tear gas and less-lethal force and to require body-worn cameras. Despite officials asserting compliance and denying reports of tear gas deployment without warning, the judge expressed serious concern over the lack of transparency, particularly in the absence of testimony from Russell Hott, the former interim ICE head in Chicago. The judge has now ordered depositions of Hott and CBP’s chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to obtain firsthand accounts. Protests at the Broadview ICE facility continue, with over 100 demonstrators and 15 arrests reported, highlighting public resistance to enforcement actions. The administration has faced criticism for allegedly relying on selectively edited media and failing to disclose critical details about crowd control tactics.",
