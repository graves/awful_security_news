  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing better than expected, according to US Vice President JD Vance, who visited Israel to support its implementation. Despite a recent Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli air strikes killing dozens of Palestinians, both sides have shown commitment to the truce. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of 28 deceased Israeli hostages, including Tal Haimi, while Israel insists on full recovery before peace talks. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pushing for negotiations on a long-term peace plan involving an interim Palestinian government, international stabilization force, troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. However, Israel remains unwilling to enter talks until all hostages are accounted for. Humanitarian access remains limited, with only two aid crossings operational, leading to severe shortages in northern Gaza. The ceasefire's stability is vital for both peace and humanitarian delivery, with ongoing international pressure to prevent its collapse.",
