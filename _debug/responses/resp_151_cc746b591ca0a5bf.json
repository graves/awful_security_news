    "President Donald Trump claimed that each boat struck off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 American lives, based on the assumption that the boats were carrying fentanyl.",

    "Drug experts and researchers state that Venezuela plays a minor role in drug trafficking into the U.S., especially in relation to fentanyl, which primarily originates in Mexico.",
    "The CDC reported over 73,000 drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025, meaning that the 125,000 lives claimed to be saved (from five boats × 25,000) would exceed the number of overdose deaths in a full year.",
    "The statement is factually incorrect because drug seizures do not reliably translate to lives saved due to supply chain replacement and individual variability in drug tolerance.",
    "Legal experts have questioned whether the strikes are legal under international maritime law or human rights conventions, contradicting longstanding U.S. military practices."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump claimed that each military strike on Venezuelan boats off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 American lives, asserting that the boats were carrying fentanyl. However, the claim lacks evidence: no drugs were visible in public videos, no data was provided on the type or quantity of drugs, and drug experts say Venezuela plays a minor role in U.S. drug trafficking. The CDC recorded over 73,000 drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025, meaning that the 125,000 lives claimed to be saved would exceed the actual number of deaths in one year. Additionally, experts point out that drug supply chains replace lost drugs and that lethal doses vary by individual. The statement is scientifically and logically flawed, and legal experts question the legality of the strikes under international law. PolitiFact has rated the claim as false.",
