  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a federal funding compact with nine universities, requiring them to adopt ideological policies such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment at 15%, freezing tuition for five years, and defining gender by biological processes. In response, five universities — including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, and MIT — have formally rejected the offer, citing concerns over academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and the risk of undermining merit-based research. The White House claims the compact would strengthen higher education by promoting a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and offering preferential grants and access to White House events. However, universities argue that tying funding to ideological compliance threatens academic integrity and free inquiry. Other institutions, like Vanderbilt and Arizona, are reviewing the proposal, while Dartmouth has stated it will not compromise its governance. California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to withhold state funding from schools that join, adding political pressure. The compact, initially drafted in December 2025 and revised since, aims for initial signatories by November 21, 2025, marking a significant moment in the broader struggle between federal control and academic independence in American higher education.",
