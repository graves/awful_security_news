  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Abu Foul, a 28-year-old Palestinian from northern Gaza, suffered severe torture during detention in Israeli prisons, including a head injury that resulted in complete blindness and denial of medical treatment. His case is part of a broader pattern of systematic abuse documented by organizations like the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and B’Tselem, which report that torture is widespread across Israeli prison facilities, including at Sde Teiman. Over 2,000 Palestinian detainees were released under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, many of whom bear visible physical and psychological scars from abuse. The article also highlights that at least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli prisons since October 2023, with evidence suggesting executions, and that no prison staff have been charged despite hundreds of reports. Key figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Marwan Barghouti are directly involved in the political and punitive environment of detention, with reports of targeted violence and abuse. The situation underscores a deep, institutionalized human rights crisis in Israeli prisons, where detainees are denied legal access, medical care, and basic dignity.",
