    "The Justice Department brought its first federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s campaign against Antifa, accusing two individuals—Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill)—of being part of an 'Antifa Cell' that planned and executed a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas.",
    "Prosecutors define Antifa not as a monolithic organization but as a 'militant enterprise' made up of networks and small groups who espouse insurrection and propose violent attacks on the U.S. government.",
    "The attack on July 4, 2025, involved fireworks and vandalism to draw police out, followed by shootings of a correctional officer and others, with two shooters positioned in trees across the street.",
    "Ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song was charged with attempted murder and is alleged to have purchased and supplied multiple firearms, including a binary trigger gun, and to have suggested bringing a 'wagon' of armor and rifles to overwhelm police.",
    "Ten firearms were recovered from the group, including four purchased by Song; the group allegedly shared plans, maps, and discussed camera locations and police stations.",
    "The indictment states the group's goal was to destroy U.S. government property and commit acts dangerous to human life to influence U.S. policy.",
    "This case marks a significant step in defining Antifa as a domestic terrorist entity, especially since Antifa is typically considered an ideology rather than a formal organization."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department has brought its first federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Antifa, charging Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill) with participating in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas. On July 4, 2025, the group used fireworks and vandalism to draw law enforcement out, after which two individuals opened fire on a correctional officer and others, with one of the shooters fatally wounded. Prosecutors allege the group had planned the attack over days, sharing maps and discussing weapons, and that ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song purchased and supplied multiple firearms, including a binary trigger weapon. The indictment defines Antifa as a 'militant enterprise' espousing insurrection and targeting government institutions. This case marks a significant legal effort to criminalize Antifa as a domestic terrorist group, despite its traditional perception as an ideology rather than a formal organization.",
