  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year giant panda program after sending Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji back to China in October 2025. The program, which began in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China, was a cornerstone of 'panda diplomacy,' used to strengthen diplomatic ties. China officially maintains that the program serves conservation and biodiversity goals, while the U.S. has paid over $16 million in conservation fees. As diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated, and public sentiment in China has grown skeptical—fueled by viral claims of abuse at the Memphis Zoo—China is now looking elsewhere for diplomatic outreach. With Zoo Atlanta set to end its panda loan in 2025 and other European and Australian zoos also returning pandas, the global number of Chinese pandas in zoos is shrinking. By 2025, only Xin Xin in Mexico City will remain in the Americas. While the National Zoo is hopeful about future panda returns, the program’s end signals a shift in China’s foreign policy and the end of an era in U.S.-China cultural diplomacy.",
