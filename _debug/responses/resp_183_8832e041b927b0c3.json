  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, contrasting his success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza with his failure to achieve similar results in Ukraine. It attributes the Gaza breakthrough to Israel's attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar, which gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In contrast, Trump lacks comparable leverage in Ukraine, where his attempts to pressure Vladimir Putin through sanctions and military aid have proven ineffective. The article highlights Trump’s shifting strategies, including plans for a Budapest summit with Putin and threats to supply Ukraine with long-range weapons, which have been met with resistance from both Russia and Ukraine, as well as international allies. It also notes that Putin may be exploiting Trump’s belief in in-person diplomacy, and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has observed a decline in Russian interest in diplomacy when Ukraine’s strategic options are threatened. Ultimately, the piece underscores the difficulty of achieving peace in a protracted conflict where neither side is willing to concede, and acknowledges that Trump’s earlier campaign promise to end the war in hours has been replaced by a more realistic, if still optimistic, assessment of the challenges involved.",
