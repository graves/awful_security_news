  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fatal crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, killed at least 16 people and injured several others when a steel cable snapped during operation. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) indicate that the cable failed to meet certification and operational specifications set by CARRIS, the funicular’s operator. The investigation also revealed serious maintenance failures, including false marking of completed tasks and an accepted maintenance plan that did not reflect actual compliance. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the derailment as sudden and chaotic, likening it to a toy being thrown across the street. While the interim findings are not conclusive, they highlight critical safety lapses in both equipment and maintenance protocols. A final report is expected next year.",
