  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans receiving one-on-one mental health therapy at VA facilities are reporting that their long-term sessions are being abruptly ended, often after only 8 to 12 sessions, despite clinical need for ongoing treatment. This policy shift, intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since January 2025, has led to provider resignations, patient trauma, and a breakdown in trust. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell express fear and frustration, noting that conditions such as PTSD require lifelong care, akin to chronic physical illnesses. Providers argue that session limits should be based on individual patient needs and shared decision-making, not top-down mandates. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the reports and is investigating, while the VA denies that limits exist, asserting that care is patient-centered and collaborative. The controversy highlights a conflict between administrative efficiency and ethical, trauma-informed mental health care.",
