  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. The poisoning was methodically planned over several weeks, beginning with Craig’s romantic relationships and progressing through internet searches for poisons, orders of toxic substances, and multiple purchases of eyedrops. Angela first showed symptoms on March 6, leading to hospital visits on March 9 and March 15, during which blood tests revealed toxic levels of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. Evidence such as searches on a personal email account, credit card purchases, and staff discovery of a cyanide delivery confirmed Craig’s intent. The case highlights the dangers of medical deception, toxic access, and the importance of vigilance in healthcare and workplace environments.",
