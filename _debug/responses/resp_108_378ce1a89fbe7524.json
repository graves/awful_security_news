  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025, following a political vacuum after the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) defeat in July. Takaichi, a protege of Shinzo Abe and an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, secured victory with 237 votes in the lower house, defeating opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda. Her government is formed through a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party, which has shifted Japan’s political direction toward greater nationalism and militarism. Despite being a historic milestone for gender representation in Japanese politics, Takaichi opposes gender equality measures, supports male-only imperial succession, and opposes same-sex marriage. Her government lacks a majority in both houses and will need to build alliances with opposition parties to pass legislation, raising concerns about political instability. The coalition also faces criticism over her visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which has drawn protests from China and South Korea, and over her revisionist stance on Japan’s wartime past. With urgent economic challenges—such as rising prices—on the horizon, Takaichi is under pressure to deliver policy reforms by late December to regain public trust.",
