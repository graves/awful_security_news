  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, indigenous knowledge—such as observing animal behavior, cloud formations, and using pre-agreed signals like gunfire—is being relied upon by local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to warn communities about glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are frequently seen as ineffective and untrusted due to malfunctions, poor maintenance, and lack of community involvement. Residents report that warnings have come from local actors rather than automated systems, demonstrating a gap between technological infrastructure and grassroots trust. The article highlights Pakistan’s status as one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, with rising temperatures and melting glaciers increasing disaster frequency. It concludes that sustainable climate resilience depends not only on technology but also on integrating traditional knowledge and restoring trust in local early warning networks.",
