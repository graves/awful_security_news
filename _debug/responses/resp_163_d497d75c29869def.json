  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, was previously approved in April. Trump’s public threats on Truth Social, calling it a 'Global Green New Scam Tax,' prompted a shift in the vote, with 57 countries supporting the delay and 49 opposing it. Key supporters such as China, the EU, and the UK had previously backed the initiative, while nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it. The decision has drawn criticism from climate leaders and shipping industry representatives, who warn that the delay undermines efforts to reduce shipping’s contribution to climate change. The framework aims to cut emissions by 20% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, with proposed alternatives including ammonia, methanol, and special sails. The incident highlights the growing influence of political resistance on international climate agreements.",
