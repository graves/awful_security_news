  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a congressional oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey on May 9, 2025. The incident involved her attempting to intervene in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was removed and later arrested for trespassing. McIver’s attorneys argue her actions were part of official legislative duties protected under the Speech or Debate Clause and that the prosecution is politically motivated, citing President Donald Trump’s criticism and a lack of similar charges against other Democratic lawmakers. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government officials’ social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that the event involved Antifa activity are prejudicial and ordered their removal. The prosecution will rely on surveillance and body-worn camera footage, with a trial scheduled for November 10, 2025. The case has sparked broader debate about political bias, accountability, and the role of legislative oversight in federal agencies.",
