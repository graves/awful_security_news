    "Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary under President Donald Trump, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing it was a necessary compromise due to evidentiary and jurisdictional challenges that would have made a federal trial 'a crapshoot'.",
    "Acosta maintained that all prosecutors in his office supported the plea deal, citing victim testimony inconsistencies, lack of interstate travel evidence, and jurisdictional ambiguity as key reasons for avoiding trial.",
    "Despite his defense, the deal was widely criticized as a 'sweetheart deal' and allowed Epstein to serve only 13 months in prison for state charges, sparking ongoing public outrage and media scrutiny.",
    "Acosta expressed that he was 'ticked off' by Epstein’s work release program, which allowed him to be outside jail during business hours, and objected in writing to this arrangement.",
    "Acosta denied any personal connection to Donald Trump regarding the Epstein investigation, stating he was not involved in deciding who was interviewed, and had no recollection of Trump being interviewed or having any contact with Epstein-related documents.",
    "Acosta acknowledged that, while he acted in good faith based on available evidence at the time, the outcome was viewed by victims and the public as a failure to fully protect minors and uphold justice.",
    "The congressional investigation into Epstein, including closed-door testimony, reflects broader demands for transparency in high-profile cases involving powerful figures and systemic failures in prosecution."
