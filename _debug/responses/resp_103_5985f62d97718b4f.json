  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warns that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025. With subsidies expiring at year-end and premiums projected to rise by up to $2,000 monthly — reaching over $24,000 annually — millions of working-class Americans face unaffordable health costs. Jeffries opposes a one-year extension proposed by GOP lawmakers like Mike Lawler, arguing that such measures fail to address the broader issue of health care affordability and the precedent of massive tax breaks for billionaires. He criticizes Republican policies, including a proposed bill from Senator Ron Johnson that grants President Trump discretion over federal worker pay, as lawless and politically motivated. The ongoing federal government shutdown amplifies urgency, with Jeffries emphasizing that without bipartisan action, tens of millions could lose health insurance, and hospitals and clinics may close, especially in rural areas. The article underscores a moral and economic crisis in health care policy, where working-class Americans are being left vulnerable while elite tax breaks are expanded.",
