    "Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, was criticized during the debate for not providing concrete plans on how to fund his signature policies—such as freezing rent increases on rent-controlled apartments and making buses free—raising questions about feasibility.",
    "Mamdani faced backlash for not endorsing New York Governor Kathy Hochul, despite her being one of the first major Democrats to support him, highlighting a notable political split within the party.",
    "Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, accused Mamdani of basing his platform on a 'myth' of Albany passing new taxes, and claimed Mamdani’s ideas are 'fantasies,' while also facing scrutiny over his handling of sexual harassment allegations and pandemic response in nursing homes.",
    "The debate included a heated exchange between Mamdani and Cuomo over their respective views on President Donald Trump, with Cuomo suggesting that if Mamdani becomes mayor, Trump would effectively take control of NYC, to which Mamdani responded by calling Cuomo a 'coward' and accusing him of failing to mention Trump in a statement about the DOJ indictment of Attorney General Letitia James.",
    "Mamdani reiterated his opposition to policies that promote racial or religious hierarchies, backtracking from a Fox News appearance where he expressed uncertainty about calling for Hamas to lay down arms, and stating on stage that he believes Hamas should lay down their weapons in accordance with international law.",
    "Sliwa, the Republican nominee, made a strong attempt to position himself as a non-establishment outsider, attacking Cuomo on parole decisions and referencing Mario Cuomo, while also attempting to appeal to moderate Democrats by rejecting the idea of political establishment dominance.",
    "Mamdani apologized for past statements calling police officers 'racist' and 'wicked,' and proposed a Department of Community Safety that would deploy social workers in mental health emergencies instead of relying solely on police.",
    "Mamdani advocated for raising taxes on the wealthiest residents and corporations, a position that faced political resistance from Governor Kathy Hochul, and emphasized that this tax policy is part of a broader commitment to economic fairness.",
    "The debate highlighted a growing political divide on issues including antisemitism, Gaza and Israel, police reform, public education control, and tax policy, all of which will shape the future leadership of New York City."
