  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on October 21, 2025, exposed the global vulnerability of digital infrastructure to failures in US cloud computing providers. With Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure dominating 30–40% of the UK and European cloud markets, the incident highlighted systemic risks arising from over-reliance on a few dominant tech firms. Experts point to 'nested dependency' and economies of scale as key reasons for this reliance, which offer cost and scalability advantages but also create fragility and geopolitical exposure. Regulatory bodies like the CMA have flagged competition issues, recommending strategic market status for AWS and Microsoft to promote fairness. Experts and policymakers now advocate for policy-driven solutions—such as mandating multi-provider cloud usage and data replication—to improve national resilience, diversify the UK’s cloud ecosystem, and reduce dependence on US-based infrastructure.",
