  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a funding compact with nine U.S. universities, offering expanded federal grants and access to White House events in exchange for policy changes such as eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, and adopting biologically defined gender standards. Six universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia — have formally rejected the proposal, citing violations of academic freedom and institutional autonomy. Others, such as Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, are reviewing the offer, while the University of Texas at Austin has expressed openness. The White House claims the compact promotes a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas,' but universities argue that it undermines merit-based competition and free inquiry. This development reflects broader tensions between federal governance and academic independence in American higher education, with state officials like California Gov. Gavin Newsom adding additional pressure by threatening to withhold state funding.",
