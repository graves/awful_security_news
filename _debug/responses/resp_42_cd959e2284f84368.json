A 20-something man was arrested and charged in connection with the attack, and he previously had a deportation order issued in March 2025. The incident follows a similar major riot in Dublin two years prior after a stabbing of three children, showing a pattern of anti-immigrant violence.

Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan condemned the actions, calling them unacceptable and promising a strong response, while Sinn Fein pointed to the man’s deportation status as evidence of a political nexus between immigration policy and protest activity.",
