  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A California judge has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time since their conviction. While the judge acknowledged the horror of the crime and praised the brothers' demonstrated remorse, rehabilitation, and contributions in prison — including Lyle's beautification program and Erik's support groups — he did not recommend release, stating that parole should be considered in the future. The brothers, who have maintained claims of self-defense due to years of childhood abuse, are now seeking parole through the state board and potential clemency from Governor Gavin Newsom. The Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes the resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of recidivism. The parole board is set to hear their case on June 13, and Newsom has 120 days to decide whether to grant or deny parole. The decision marks a significant shift in the legal narrative of the case, opening a path to potential release after 35 years in prison, though it remains subject to further review and executive discretion.",
