  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement on October 21, 2025, allowing the Trump administration to transfer asylum seekers to Belize. The deal is part of a broader effort to limit asylum applications and increase deportations, drawing criticism for potential human rights violations, especially given concerns about conditions in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan, and El Salvador. Belize asserts that it has safeguards including national security vetting, transfer caps, and restrictions on nationality, and claims to uphold international refugee law. However, critics, including Belize opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton, argue that Belize lacks the resources and capacity to properly handle asylum seekers and that the agreement amounts to using Belize as a 'dumping ground'. The agreement still requires Senate approval and faces scrutiny over its compliance with international humanitarian law and the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning people to countries where they face persecution.",
