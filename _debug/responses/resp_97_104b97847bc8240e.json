  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US conducted a seventh strike on a boat suspected of being linked to a Colombian terrorist organization, killing all three occupants and confirming the presence of substantial narcotics. The operation, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reflects the Trump administration’s hardline stance against drug trafficking, including the use of lethal military strikes without due process. This aligns with a broader strategy involving CIA operations in Venezuela and pressure on South American leaders, such as Nicolás Maduro and Gustavo Petro. The move has drawn significant international criticism, particularly from Colombia, where President Petro accused the US of killing an innocent national and canceled US aid. Legal experts highlight that a classified legal opinion now justifies the designation of drug traffickers as enemy combatants and allows for summary executions—a stark shift from traditional criminal justice practices. Senators including Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski have raised ethical and constitutional concerns, calling the actions a violation of due process and democratic norms.",
