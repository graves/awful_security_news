  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on Trump’s threat of imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China’s retaliatory export controls on rare earth minerals. This confrontation follows a history of tit-for-tat tariffs and technology restrictions, including past US actions such as the 25% and 20% tariffs, and China’s WTO complaints over export restraints. China justifies its actions as a response to US targeting of its military and technology sectors, while accusing the US of double standards and discriminatory practices. Experts argue that both nations are using economic tools strategically ahead of a high-stakes meeting in South Korea, with China showing greater strategic preparation and the US appearing inconsistent. The conflict threatens global supply chains, particularly in semiconductors and green technologies, and may deepen uncertainty in international trade and economic diplomacy.",
