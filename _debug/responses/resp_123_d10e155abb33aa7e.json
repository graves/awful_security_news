  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, is gathering for the fourth plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party to finalize the national five-year plan for 2026–2030. This closed-door meeting comes amid heightened trade tensions with the United States, especially under former President Donald Trump’s trade policies, and as China seeks to achieve technological self-sufficiency in areas like artificial intelligence and advanced chip manufacturing. While the economy is projected to grow at 4.8%, challenges from a slowing property sector, overcapacity in industries, and low consumer confidence persist. Experts suggest that bolder policy actions are needed to stimulate domestic consumption and address long-term demographic pressures, including a youth unemployment rate of nearly 19%. The plan, though likely to follow previous formats, is critical to China’s political legitimacy and its goal of doubling economic size by 2035.",
