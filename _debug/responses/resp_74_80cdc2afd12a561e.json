  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by Portugal's GPIAAF into a deadly September 2025 funicular crash in Lisbon found that a steel cable in the Glória funicular failed to meet the operator CARRIS's specifications and was not certified for passenger use. The cable snapped shortly after the cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, causing one car to derail and crash into a building, killing at least 16 people and injuring several others. Eyewitnesses described the event as sudden and chaotic. The investigation also revealed serious maintenance failures, including false completion records and a flawed maintenance plan that was improperly accepted by the operator. While the interim findings are not conclusive, they indicate systemic failures in safety protocols, raising urgent concerns about public transport safety standards in Portugal and globally.",
