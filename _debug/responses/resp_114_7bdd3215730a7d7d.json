The revelations triggered strong opposition from Republican senators, including conservative allies like Ron Johnson and John Thune, who said they would not support the nomination. The Office of Special Counsel, which protects government employees and enforces the Hatch Act, is a key oversight body, making the nomination politically sensitive. The incident marks a rare instance of internal Republican dissent against a Trump nominee, following previous withdrawals of other nominees such as Matt Gaetz and Ed Martin Jr. The White House confirmed Ingrassia is no longer the nominee, while Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer criticized the withdrawal as insufficient and called for Ingrassia’s removal from his current White House role.",
