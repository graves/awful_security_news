  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist on October 20, 2025, thieves broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris using power tools and a vehicle-mounted lift to access the Galerie d'Apollon, stealing eight 19th-century royal jewels including diadems, necklaces, and brooches. The gang, reportedly experienced and acting under criminal orders, entered at 09:30 and escaped on two scooters by 09:38, with one item, Empress Eugénie’s crown, found damaged. A preliminary report notes that one in three rooms in the area had no CCTV, and the local alarm was likely disabled, revealing serious security gaps. The theft has triggered widespread outrage, with political leaders condemning it as an 'attack on history' and a 'wound to the French soul'. Experts believe the stolen items will be broken down and sold in pieces to extract value. This incident follows a recent wave of museum thefts in France, including the 1998 Corot theft and the 2024 Cognacq-Jay and Hieron Museum incidents. Though the Louvre’s wider alarms activated and staff followed protocol, the breach highlights ongoing vulnerabilities despite a planned €700–800 million renovation under President Macron’s New Renaissance project. The museum remains closed, with no reopening date announced.",
