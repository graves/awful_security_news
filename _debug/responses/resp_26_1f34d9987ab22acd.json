  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith have directly challenged claims by Republican lawmakers that investigators in the January 6 Capitol attack probe illegally ‘wired’ GOP members of Congress. The toll records, which reveal call times and numbers but not content, were obtained through 2023 court orders and cover a narrow four-day window (January 4–7, 2021) to determine whether Trump and his surrogates attempted to contact senators to delay the certification of the 2020 election results. Smith’s legal team argues that the collection was lawful, narrowly tailored, and consistent with routine investigative procedures, noting similar toll data were used in other cases, including those involving President Joe Biden and Senator Bob Menendez. Republican senators assert this reflects political weaponization, especially given the timing of indictments involving Trump’s allies, prompting scrutiny during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
