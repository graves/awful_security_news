    "Arizona's attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson's refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Representative Adelita Grijalva.",
    "The lawsuit claims that the Constitution requires elected members to be sworn in upon meeting qualification standards, and that the Speaker does not have the authority to delay swearing-in based on session status.",
    "Mike Johnson argues he is following the precedent set by Nancy Pelosi, who delayed swearing-in of elected members after House recesses, but this has been challenged as a violation of constitutional principles.",
    "The lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s delay is politically motivated, aimed at preventing a petition for Epstein-related records release and to strengthen his position in budget negotiations.",
    "Grijalva has not spoken to Johnson since winning the election, and is seeking a personal meeting to resolve the dispute.",
    "The lawsuit requests a federal judge to order an authorized official to administer the oath to Grijalva if Johnson refuses, asserting that the Constitution does not grant the Speaker such discretionary power.",
    "The legal action is framed as a defense of democratic principles: elected officials must serve in office immediately upon election, not be delayed by political maneuvering."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona's attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires elected representatives to be sworn in immediately upon qualification and that the Speaker lacks constitutional authority to delay the process, especially when no valid reason exists. Johnson claims he is following Nancy Pelosi’s precedent of delaying swearing-in after recess, but the Arizona government asserts this is an arbitrary political tactic to block a petition regarding Jeffrey Epstein records and to gain leverage in budget negotiations. Grijalva, who has not spoken to Johnson since her election, is seeking a direct meeting to resolve the standoff. The legal action seeks a federal judge’s order to allow a qualified official to administer the oath if Johnson continues to refuse.",
