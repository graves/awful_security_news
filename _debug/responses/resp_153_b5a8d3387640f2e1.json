  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American teenager, has been held in Israeli detention since February 2025 following a raid on his family’s home in the West Bank. He has endured harsh conditions including cold cells, minimal and inadequate meals (with no dinner or fruit), and reportedly physical abuse during arrest. Despite being a US citizen, he is being prosecuted in an Israeli military court, where children are systematically tried and treated inhumane conditions. His case has become a symbol of the broader systemic mistreatment of Palestinian minors in Israeli jails, with over 79 detainees reported dead since October 2023 due to lack of medical care and abuse. Rights groups, US lawmakers, and his family are urging the US government, particularly under President Donald Trump, to use diplomatic pressure to secure his release. The situation has gained renewed attention amid the Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchanges, raising urgent global human rights concerns about children's rights and the treatment of detainees in Israeli military custody.",
