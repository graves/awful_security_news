  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the United States, has paused job offers to foreign applicants requiring H-1B visas after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee on these work visas. This policy shift, which follows widespread economic concern over the program’s cost to companies, reflects growing disruption in the U.S. labor market. The H-1B visa program, used extensively by tech firms and e-commerce platforms like Walmart and Amazon, is vital for maintaining access to high-skilled talent. The new fee, intended to curb perceived abuse, is expected to disproportionately impact skilled professionals from India, who have historically dominated H-1B approvals. The move signals a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy with potentially far-reaching effects on business innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness.",
