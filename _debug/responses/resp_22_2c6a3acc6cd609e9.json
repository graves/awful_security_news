  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday. The storm poses a significant threat to the northern Caribbean, particularly Hispaniola, where it could bring over a foot of rain, leading to flash flooding and dangerous mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in place for Jamaica. Puerto Rico is also at risk of receiving heavy rain. While the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the most likely path involves it turning north and strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday, potentially impacting the region through the weekend. An alternate path could take Melissa west toward Central America. Though a direct hit on the mainland U.S. is unlikely, there is a low chance of impacts on Florida or the Bahamas. This development highlights the increasing role of climate change in fueling rapid storm intensification, as warmer Caribbean waters provide more energy for storms like Melissa, echoing earlier cases of rapid intensification seen in hurricanes Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto.",
