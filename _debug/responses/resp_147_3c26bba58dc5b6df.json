The U.S. government is attempting to deport him, citing adverse foreign policy consequences from his advocacy, invoking a provision allowing deportation for such perceived consequences. However, civil liberties advocates, including the ACLU, argue that this use of immigration law to silence political speech violates constitutional free speech protections. Khalil was accused of concealing his work with UNRWA on visa and Green Card applications, though these claims are contested. His case is currently under appeal through the Board of Immigration Appeals and may eventually go to a circuit court on constitutional grounds. The broader context includes a prior ruling finding the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists unlawful, as it violates free speech rights. This case exemplifies a growing political and legal conflict over the limits of immigration enforcement and free expression in the United States.",
