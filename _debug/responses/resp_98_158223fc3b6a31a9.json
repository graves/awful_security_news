  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced significant legal and political scrutiny after deciding to release two survivors of alleged drug-related submarine strikes in the Caribbean, rather than detaining them for prosecution. This move undermines the administration’s claims of an active, imminent threat from 'narco-terrorists' and raises serious questions about due process, transparency, and the legality of military actions without congressional approval. Experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have criticized the administration for effectively claiming war-like powers without justifying them under U.S. law. The decision to release the men — particularly in light of the lack of public evidence about fentanyl trafficking, the absence of a declared war, and the diplomatic pushback from leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro — appears to be a strategic effort to avoid legal accountability. Meanwhile, growing bipartisan concern, including from Republican Senator Todd Young, and potential congressional action suggest increasing pressure on the administration to justify its actions under the rule of law.",
