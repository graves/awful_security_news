  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S.-targeted semi-submersible vessel destroyed in the Caribbean would be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia. The vessel, allegedly carrying fentanyl and other narcotics, was targeted as part of a broader U.S. military campaign against drug trafficking, with Trump claiming it was an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels. The operation has killed at least 29 people, with no verified evidence that the victims were drug smugglers. Critics argue the actions exceed wartime authority and violate international law, especially given the lack of evidence linking the vessels to actual narcotics smuggling. The U.S. has significantly escalated its military presence in the Caribbean, including deploying F-35 jets, destroyers, and a nuclear-powered submarine, and authorized covert CIA operations inside Venezuela. Venezuelan officials, including President Nicolás Maduro and ambassador Samuel Moncada, have condemned the strikes as violations of sovereignty and called on the UN Security Council to declare them illegal.",
