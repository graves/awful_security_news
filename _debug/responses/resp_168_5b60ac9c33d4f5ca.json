He describes the practice as 'wicked' and immoral, arguing that it amounts to theft and threatens the future of creative industries. The issue follows a government consultation launched in December 2024, which received 11,500 responses and prompted the formation of expert working groups on AI and copyright. Pullman emphasizes the value of imagination, portraying it as a form of perception akin to emotional experiences like love, hope, and memory. He criticizes current education policies and religious institutions that suppress curiosity and creative thinking, aligning his personal narrative with broader societal concerns. The upcoming release of The Rose Field, the final book in the Lyra trilogy, reinforces his themes of imagination and resistance. Despite being a writer of imaginative fiction, Pullman insists his work is grounded in reality, not fantasy, and he remains open to the possibility of future stories in his universe.",
