  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Misty Copeland, the first Black woman principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre and a pioneering advocate for diversity in ballet, is retiring after a decades-long career. Her journey—from joining the ABT’s corps at 18 to becoming a principal in 2015—challenged long-standing racial and cultural norms in classical ballet. She broke barriers not only on stage, where her expressive, emotionally charged performances stood out, but off stage, where she used her platform to fight for representation in media, technology, and dance institutions. Her influence helped spark a rise in Black ballerinas across the U.S., including India Bradley, the first Black woman soloist at New York City Ballet. Despite progress, disparities remain in leadership roles, with no Black female principals at major companies. Copeland’s retirement is marked by a star-studded farewell gala featuring tributes from Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen, and she will perform a new piece choreographed by Kyle Abraham. The article underscores her legacy as both a groundbreaking performer and a cultural force who redefined what ballet can be for people of color.",
