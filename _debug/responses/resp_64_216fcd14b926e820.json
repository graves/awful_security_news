  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates exploitative labor conditions in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where workers—mostly women—face long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite being a crucial part of Guatemala’s economy, contributing nearly 10% of GDP, these factories operate under opaque supply chains, with US brands like Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren benefiting without legal accountability. Korean companies dominate investments and control subcontracting, making it difficult for workers to access fair wages or benefits. Workers report being punished for missing quotas, denied pensions, and threatened with violence if they organize. Union activities are met with resistance, including the murder of a union representative and the dismissal of union members. Government oversight is weak, with factory owners blocking inspections and the labor ministry unable to enforce regulations. The article highlights the personal and systemic trauma faced by workers, such as Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, who lost jobs and financial security, and raises concerns about the impact of global trade policies and the gendered nature of supply chain labor. While Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms, real change remains elusive.",
