  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of veterans and VA mental health providers are raising alarms over a policy shift under the Trump administration and led by VA Secretary Doug Collins, which limits the number of long-term one-on-one therapy sessions for veterans. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned when therapy abruptly ends, especially when they are not clinically ready to transition to group therapy or self-care. Providers report being pressured to end sessions, facing disciplinary consequences for resisting, and expressing clinical concern that such limits are inappropriate for chronic conditions like PTSD. While the VA claims there are no fixed limits and that care is individualized, providers and the American Psychological Association say the policy is being enforced in ways that undermine patient trust and recovery. The broader debate centers on whether care should be standardized or individualized, and whether veterans with long-term mental health needs should be treated with the same continuity as those with chronic physical illnesses.",
