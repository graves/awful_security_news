  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is actively investigating the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 migrant arrests. She expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for federal agents on the ground, particularly to monitor use of force. CBP agents are required to wear cameras, but ICE’s Special Response Teams have not been issued them and would require congressional approval to receive them. Testimony from officials revealed training in crowd control and press handling, but also raised concerns over lack of warning before tear gas and pepper balls were deployed—such as during an incident involving Pastor David Black. The federal leadership structure is described as unstable, with frequent personnel changes, and Judge Ellis plans to depose key figures like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino to understand what happened on the ground during the protests. This scrutiny reflects broader public and legal concerns about transparency, accountability, and the appropriate use of force by federal agencies during civil demonstrations.",
