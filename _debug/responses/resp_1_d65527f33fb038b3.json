  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has escalated drone attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, with attacks occurring over 15 days and resulting in blackouts, casualties, and prolonged humanitarian crises. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded by turning to European allies for urgent military and financial support, including proposals to use frozen Russian assets—amounting to $200 billion—to fund critical defense systems such as Patriot air defense batteries. The European Union, led by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is exploring a $163 billion loan to Ukraine, though Russia denies the legitimacy of such asset seizures. Meanwhile, concerns grow over a potential peace summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Putin, which Ukrainian officials see as a threat to genuine negotiations. Analysts note a pattern where shifts in U.S. rhetoric—especially under Donald Trump—trigger Russian escalations, suggesting a strategic interplay between political dynamics and military actions.",
