  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to represent James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to share classified information during 2017, despite Fitzgerald’s claim that the memos were unclassified at the time they were shared. Fitzgerald argues that the memos were authored and originally shared as unclassified documents, and that the later upclassification does not invalidate their initial status. The dispute raises ethical concerns about a lawyer serving as both a witness and defense counsel, a scenario deemed legally problematic by experts. The case is embedded in the broader context of the 2016 Russian election investigation and the tensions between FBI Director Comey and President Trump.",
