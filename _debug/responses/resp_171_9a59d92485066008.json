  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, with President Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its actions as a national security measure in response to U.S. trade restrictions on Chinese entities and sectors. This latest move, occurring weeks before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea, risks reigniting a trade war after a previous truce. Historically, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods have fluctuated from 25% to 145%, with China retaliating with countermeasures, including tariffs and export restrictions. The conflict reflects a broader strategic competition where both nations weaponize economic policy and national security, with China asserting a broader definition of national security and the U.S. relying on tariffs and export controls. Experts suggest that while China appears more strategic and organized, the U.S. still holds greater global influence, and the outcome hinges on market resilience and diplomatic resolve rather than immediate concessions. The article underscores how economic policy has become deeply intertwined with geopolitical strategy in the era of great power competition.",
