    "The blame game in the shutdown is currently tilted toward Democrats, despite Republicans making the policy demand for extended Obamacare subsidies.",
    "Public opinion polls consistently show Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats, especially in recent weeks, with a gap of up to 17 points in favor of blaming Republicans.",
    "The demand for extended Obamacare subsidies is popular — 72% of Americans and 51% of Republicans support it, making it a politically viable leverage point.",
    "Democrats may have a stronger political incentive to hold out, especially as the shutdown's impact on health care costs (premiums doubling) looms over open enrollment on November 1.",
    "If Republicans fear the political fallout from premium hikes, they may be pressured to negotiate — suggesting a shift in the power dynamic from previous shutdowns.",
    "Historically, the party making the policy demand (e.g., GOP in 1995–96 and 2018–19) lost politically and gave in; now, Democrats, despite being in the minority, are holding firm on a popular demand.",
    "This shutdown presents a rare opportunity for Democrats to win politically by maintaining pressure and demonstrating resolve, even in a polarized environment."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The federal government shutdown has reached 21 days, with the potential to exceed the previous record of 35 days. Unlike past shutdowns where the party making the policy demand (Republicans in 1995–96 and 2018–19) lost politically and gave in, the current situation is reversed: Democrats are demanding extended Obamacare subsidies, which are widely supported (72% of Americans), and are now winning the public blame game. Polls show Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats, with a gap of up to 17 points. This dynamic is especially significant because the policy demand is popular and politically viable. As the deadline for open enrollment approaches on November 1, the financial impact of subsidy cuts — including doubled health insurance premiums — may pressure Republicans to negotiate. Democrats may therefore have a rare opportunity to win politically by maintaining pressure, even though they are not making the initial policy demand. The article raises questions about whether Democrats will hold out or concede, depending on how Republicans respond to the potential political consequences of premium hikes and the public’s perception of blame.",
