  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a high-stakes Thursday Night Football matchup dubbed the 'Icy Hot Bowl', 40-year-old Joe Flacco outperformed 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in a dramatic 33-31 win for the Cincinnati Bengals over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite Rodgers surpassing Ben Roethlisberger to move into fifth place on the NFL’s all-time career passing yards list, Flacco’s steady performance—throwing for 342 yards and three touchdowns, including a crucial two-minute drive that ended with a game-winning field goal—proved decisive. The Bengals, who had lost their starting quarterback to injury and relied on Flacco’s experience, remained competitive with strong performances from Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, while Chase Brown had his first 100-yard rushing game. The Steelers, though hampered by a late touchdown from Rodgers, fell to 4-2 and remain atop the AFC North. The game underscored the continued relevance and excellence of veteran players in the NFL, challenging age-based assumptions about athletic performance.",
