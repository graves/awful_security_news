  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central estimates that, despite current climate commitments, the planet will face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of extreme heat—due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the pre-Paris Agreement worst-case scenario of 114 such days, but still poses a severe threat to human health and ecosystems. The findings reveal a stark global imbalance: small, vulnerable island nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face massive increases in heat exposure, while the world’s top carbon polluters—such as the U.S., China, and India—experience only a fraction of those impacts. Experts warn that this disparity not only reflects climate injustice but could also fuel geopolitical tensions, underscoring the urgent need for equitable climate action.",
