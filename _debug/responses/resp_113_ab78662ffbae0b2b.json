  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines how former President Donald Trump has blurred the lines between crime and immigration by deploying the National Guard in multiple cities, including Chicago, Memphis, and Washington, D.C. Despite the National Guard being legally prohibited from making arrests, these deployments are linked to aggressive immigration enforcement operations led by ICE, such as Operation Midway Blitz in Illinois and raids in Los Angeles. The administration’s rhetoric conflates illegal immigration with urban crime, despite data showing no correlation. This has led to public fear, confusion, and protests, which in turn have been used as justification for military intervention. Experts argue that the deployments are legally and ethically problematic, particularly under the Posse Comitatus Act, and that the use of military forces in domestic law enforcement undermines public trust. Cases like Operation Lone Star in Texas show a precedent of state military involvement in border enforcement, raising concerns about continuity and escalation in federal operations.",
