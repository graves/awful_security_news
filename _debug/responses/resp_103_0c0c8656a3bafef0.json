    "The term 'enshittification' describes how internet platforms degrade over time, shifting from user-friendly early stages to exploitative, profit-driven models.",
    "Doctorow outlines three stages of enshittification: (1) user acquisition through attractive pricing and network effects, (2) business customer favoritism at user expense, and (3) profit maximization at the expense of both users and merchants.",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples where data exploitation, predatory pricing, and algorithmic manipulation have led to deteriorating experiences for users and small businesses.",
    "Amazon is accused of cloning products, charging junk fees (up to 51 cents per dollar earned), and distorting search results, with the first result being 29% more expensive than the best match.",
    "Doctorow argues that the lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations allow platforms to treat users as expendable, protected by network effects and high switching costs.",
    "Proposed solutions include antitrust enforcement, abandoning the consumer welfare standard, implementing a 'right-to-exit' policy (e.g., allowing users to take data with them), and promoting interoperability (e.g., allowing cross-platform app and device compatibility)."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow’s new book and theory of 'enshittification' explains how internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade over time — starting with user-friendly, growth-oriented phases and progressing to exploitative, profit-driven models where users and businesses are treated poorly. Doctorow outlines three stages: (1) user acquisition through network effects and attractive deals; (2) favoring business customers at the expense of users; and (3) squeezing profits through predatory pricing, algorithmic manipulation, and high fees. Amazon is accused of charging sellers up to 51 cents per dollar earned, distorting search results, and cloning products, while Facebook is criticized for algorithmic ad targeting and forcing publishers to publish longer content. The root causes are attributed to a lack of competition and weak regulation, particularly the consumer welfare standard. Doctorow proposes solutions including stronger antitrust enforcement, the 'right-to-exit' policy, and increased interoperability between platforms to restore fairness and competition in digital services.",
