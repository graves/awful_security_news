  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is constructing a $250 million, 90,000 sq ft White House ballroom, with construction starting in October 2025. The project is funded through a mix of personal contributions from Trump, anonymous corporate donations, and a confirmed $22 million from YouTube as part of a legal settlement. Donors, including executives from major tech firms like Microsoft, Google, and Palantir, and sports executives such as Woody Johnson and the Glazers, are expected to contribute, with some possibly receiving public recognition. Legal experts, including former ethics lawyer Richard Painter, warn the arrangement could constitute a 'pay-to-play' scheme where access to the White House is exchanged for financial support. While the White House claims no taxpayer cost and that the ballroom will save money in the long term by replacing expensive tent events, critics argue that the funding model risks undermining transparency and ethical standards in political governance.",
