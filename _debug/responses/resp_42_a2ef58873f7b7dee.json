  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during an arrival from Dubai, crashing into the sea and killing two airport staff who were in a patrol vehicle. The aircraft, a Boeing model, broke in two upon impact, with significant damage to the front section and tail. The four crew members on board were treated for injuries, and there was no cargo on board. The flight was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, though it carried an Emirates flight number. No distress signals were received from the pilots. The incident led to a massive emergency response involving over 200 personnel and the suspension of operations on the north runway. The event is notable given the airport’s history of rare but significant aviation accidents, including a 1999 crash at the former Kai Tak Airport, and highlights ongoing safety concerns despite Hong Kong’s status as one of the world’s busiest airports.",
