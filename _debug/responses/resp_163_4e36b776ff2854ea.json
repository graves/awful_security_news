  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically low, with only 750 metric tonnes entering daily—far below the 2,000-tonne target—due to just two open border crossings (Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara). Despite increasing to 26 distribution points from five, the WFP still lacks access to key routes like Salah al-Din Street and the Rafah crossing, which remains closed until Hamas returns more captives' bodies. The US-brokered ceasefire is seen as essential for sustained humanitarian access, and while some aid has reached northern Gaza via southern routes, most populations are rationing food due to fear of renewed conflict. The situation underscores the urgent need for more crossings, greater access, and political commitment to humanitarian aid delivery.",
