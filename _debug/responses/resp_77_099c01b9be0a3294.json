The move follows a previous diplomatic exchange in July and comes after President Donald Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian goods. The U.S. has launched missile attacks on seven vessels, killing at least 30 people, including some alleged to be Colombians, prompting Petro to accuse the U.S. of 'murder' and supporting a plot to remove him from power. The conflict reflects broader issues of drug trafficking, national sovereignty, and economic retaliation between the two nations.",
