These new rules, administered by Israel’s COGAT committee, include vetting by the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, and have led to the denial or rejection of registration requests from groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps.

Over 90% of homes in Gaza have been destroyed, and only two of seven border crossings are open, with many aid requests rejected without explanation. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire promising increased aid, delivery remains severely restricted. The U.S. ended its funding to UNRWA in 2024, and while other countries have partially replaced it, the funding gap persists. Humanitarian officials argue that the new registration process is not designed to facilitate aid but to systematically remove humanitarian organizations from operations in Palestinian territories.",
