  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran, especially since 2012, have significantly harmed the country’s middle class — a historically moderate and reform-oriented group that once drove political stability and social progress. A study using a synthetic control method found that, without sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have grown by 17%, but in reality, it shrank by 28% by 2019, with around 9 million people losing middle-class status. Economic pressures from inflation (42.4%), high unemployment (7.4%–9.2%), and rising costs of basic goods have deepened inequality, leaving many to struggle with daily survival. The elite, including state-linked actors like the IRGC and bonyads, have profited from the economic downturn, while the middle class has lost its economic security and political influence. This shift has transformed protest movements from reform-focused to survival-driven, increasing instability and making them more vulnerable to repression. Experts warn that rebuilding the middle class is a generational challenge, as the damage from sanctions has fundamentally altered Iran’s social and political fabric.",
