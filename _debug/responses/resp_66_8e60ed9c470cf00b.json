  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro has sparked widespread anxiety in Colombia, as Trump threatens to cut US subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian exports—particularly oil, coffee, flowers, and manufactured goods—accusing Petro of promoting drug production. In response, Petro has denounced Trump as 'rude and ignorant,' and the conflict has intensified public fears about economic damage, job losses, and disrupted family ties, especially regarding US visas. Colombia, which relies on the US as its largest trading partner and source of drug control aid ($450 million annually), faces significant economic and social risks. The feud reflects deeper tensions over drug trafficking, foreign policy, and mutual respect between leaders, with ordinary Colombians expressing frustration that the conflict harms their livelihoods and national dignity.",
