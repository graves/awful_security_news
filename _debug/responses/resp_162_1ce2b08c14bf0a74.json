    "President Donald Trump has announced plans to build a new $250 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, marking the first major structural change since 1948.",
    "The project began on Monday, October 21, 2025, despite not receiving formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a government shutdown.",
    "The ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet with a seating capacity of around 650 guests (some reports suggest up to 999), significantly larger than the current East Room, which seats about 200.",
    "Trump claims the project is privately funded by himself and private donors, with no cost to taxpayers, though no specific donors have been disclosed.",
    "The East Wing, originally added in 1902 and used since 1977 for first lady offices and visitor access, will undergo reconstruction without demolition of the main White House building.",
    "The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction (Virginia) and engineering by AECOM (Dallas).",
    "The ballroom is intended to host state dinners and large events for national leaders, addressing a long-standing criticism that the White House lacks a dedicated space for such gatherings.",
    "The project has raised concerns about transparency and oversight, especially given that it bypassed the National Capital Planning Commission’s formal approval process.",
    "The White House has undergone structural changes since 1800, with notable modifications in the 20th century, including the addition of the East Wing in 1902 and its use by the first lady since 1977."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the construction of a $250 million new ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, the first major structural change to the complex since 1948. The project, which began on October 21, 2025, involves reconstructing the two-story East Wing—historically used for first lady offices and visitor access—without demolishing the main structure. Despite not receiving formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission due to a government shutdown, construction proceeds under Trump’s assertion that the project is privately funded and will not cost taxpayers. The new ballroom, estimated to seat up to 999 people, aims to address longstanding complaints about insufficient space for state dinners and high-level diplomatic events. The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM. It marks a significant shift in White House operations and has sparked debate over transparency, oversight, and the precedent of bypassing established federal planning bodies.",
