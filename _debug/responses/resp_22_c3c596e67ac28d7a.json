  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for a meeting. This shift follows a recent phone call between Trump and Putin, during which a meeting within two weeks was proposed, but subsequent diplomatic efforts—including a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov—did not yield progress. Officials argue that Lavrov lacks real influence over Russian policy, and that the Russian position on Ukraine has not evolved sufficiently to justify a high-level summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky links peace efforts to Ukraine’s access to long-range missile capabilities, suggesting this is a key leverage point. Despite the stalled summit, the White House maintains that Trump remains committed to achieving a diplomatic resolution to the war in Ukraine, and alternative diplomatic discussions, such as with ASEAN, may continue.",
