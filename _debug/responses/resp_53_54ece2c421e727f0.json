  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American culture, from fashion and advertising to politics and television. It traces the mythological roots of the cowboy back to the 1880s Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and links its modern popularity to political conservatism, particularly under the Trump administration, where cowboy symbolism represents individualism, patriotism, and resistance to urban or liberal values. While popularized in media through shows like 'Yellowstone' and celebrity fashion campaigns, the article critiques the mythologized portrayal of cowboys as heroic and noble, ignoring the historical realities that include Mexican, Native, and enslaved Black Americans. The article highlights efforts by Black cowboys, such as those in the Bill Pickett Rodeo and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour, to reclaim visibility and recognition. Despite these advances, the dominant cultural narrative continues to reflect a whitewashed, romanticized version of the West, illustrating the ongoing cyclical nature of cultural myth-making in American society.",
