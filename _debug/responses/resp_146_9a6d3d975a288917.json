  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors from a US-military-targeted semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, alleged to be carrying fentanyl and other narcotics, will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia. The vessel, described as specifically designed for drug trafficking, was struck in a military operation Trump framed as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, citing the same legal authority used after 9/11. The operation resulted in two deaths and two survivors, who were airlifted to a US Navy warship and held until at least Friday. The US military has carried out at least six such strikes since September, with Venezuela accused of originating some of the vessels. The actions have sparked international criticism, with Venezuela accusing the US of violating sovereignty and international law, and with its ambassador formally requesting the UN to declare the strikes illegal. Meanwhile, the lack of diplomatic response from Ecuador and Colombia underscores the complexity of repatriation and state sovereignty in this context.",
