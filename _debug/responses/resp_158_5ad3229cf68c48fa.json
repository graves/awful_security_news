  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump claims that no US president has ever ended a war, asserting that only he has achieved such a feat. However, the article refutes this claim by citing historical examples: President Theodore Roosevelt mediated the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, President Jimmy Carter facilitated the Camp David Accords ending the Egypt-Israel conflict in 1978, and President Bill Clinton oversaw the Dayton Accords (ending the Bosnian War) and the Good Friday Agreement (ending the Northern Ireland conflict). Additionally, President George W. Bush oversaw the 2005 Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement. These examples show that multiple US presidents have personally or through appointed diplomats ended major wars, with some receiving Nobel Peace Prizes. The article concludes that Trump’s statement is false, as it ignores a long history of US diplomatic success in ending conflicts. It also notes that Trump’s claims about ending wars are exaggerated and often based on short-term or incremental ceasefires, and that some agreements, like the one between Cambodia and Thailand or the Egypt-Ethiopia dam dispute, have failed or remain unresolved.",
