  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have backed US President Donald Trump's proposal for a ceasefire at the current front line in Ukraine, urging a halt to fighting and negotiations from that line. However, Russia, through Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, rejects this idea, insisting that any peace must address the 'root causes' of the war — including full Russian sovereignty over Donbas and Ukraine's demilitarisation — which Kyiv and its allies view as unacceptable. While Trump has publicly supported a ceasefire at the battle line and stated that the conflict should 'stop at the battle line,' he has denied pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to surrender Donbas. Zelensky maintains that Ukraine will not give up territory, warning it could be used for future attacks. A potential direct Trump-Putin summit in Budapest is being considered, but faces logistical and political hurdles, especially due to international arrest warrants against Putin and the refusal of Poland and Lithuania to allow his plane through their airspace. Bulgaria has offered a possible transit route, highlighting the complex diplomatic and geopolitical tensions shaping the current peace negotiations.",
