  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has faced repeated art thefts throughout history, beginning with the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia, which significantly elevated the painting’s global fame. During WWII, the Nazis threatened to loot the museum, prompting director Jacques Jaujard to evacuate thousands of masterpieces, preserving them from cultural loss. Earlier heists, such as the 1966 theft of jewellery from JFK Airport and the 1990 theft of Renoir’s portrait, highlighted vulnerabilities in international art transport and internal security. The most recent 2025 heist—targeting eight Napoleonic-era jewellery pieces—differs from past incidents because it involves high-intrinsic-value items that can be recut and sold separately, making recovery extremely difficult. Experts like Noah Charney emphasize that such jewellery thefts are distinct due to their financial appeal and lack of cultural value in the thieves’ calculations, reducing the likelihood of intact recovery without a substantial reward.",
