    "President Donald Trump has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers and broader destabilisation efforts against Nicolás Maduro's regime.",
    "Such authorisations, known as presidential findings, do not require congressional approval and can be expanded or modified via executive orders, giving the president broad discretion over the scope and execution of operations.",
    "Historical precedents include Carter’s support for Afghan rebels, Reagan’s aid to Nicaraguan Contras, and post-9/11 operations against al-Qaeda and Syrian rebels, showing a long-standing pattern of U.S. covert intervention abroad.",
    "Covert actions could include targeted killings, sabotage, influence operations, and support for anti-Maduro rebel groups, with methods adapted from the 'find, fix, finish' tactics used in the global war on terror.",
    "The lack of transparency and clear limits on these operations raises concerns about accountability and the potential for escalation or human rights violations.",
    "The U.S. justification for intervention is the flow of drugs from Venezuela to the United States, particularly from designated terrorist organisations like Tren de Aragua and the Cartel of the Suns.",
    "Experts warn that past U.S. covert interventions in Latin America have often resulted in negative outcomes, including regime changes that supported authoritarianism or human rights abuses, raising ethical and strategic concerns."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, including lethal strikes and support for anti-Maduro forces, citing drug trafficking as a key justification. This presidential finding grants the CIA broad, unchecked authority without congressional approval and can be modified via executive orders. Historically, similar authorisations have enabled U.S. interventions in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Syria, and other Latin American countries, often with mixed or negative outcomes, including human rights abuses and regime changes. Experts warn that such operations could escalate, lack transparency, and represent a dangerous precedent given the potential for destabilisation and ethical violations, especially in a country like Venezuela where the government is not cooperating. The full scope and current activity of these operations remain unclear, but the implications for global security, transparency, and U.S. foreign policy are significant.",
