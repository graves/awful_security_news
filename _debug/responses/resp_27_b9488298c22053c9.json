  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, who had been missing for about two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia. Authorities were guided by an anonymous tip that led them to re-examine the site, where DNA testing confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and causing a catastrophe. Evidence includes King's cellphone activity and video footage showing a stolen Hyundai Accent parked near the location of the remains. The car was later found on fire, and investigators suspect it was used to conceal or transport Scott. Prosecutors believe King may have killed Scott, though homicide charges are pending due to legal protocol. Authorities also note possible involvement of others, and the case remains under active investigation. Scott’s family described her as kind and full of light, and her disappearance has deeply affected them.",
