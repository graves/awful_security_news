  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New dietary guidelines, co-published by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility on October 13, 2025, recommend specific, evidence-based foods such as 2 to 3 kiwifruits per day, rye bread, and high-mineral-content water to help relieve chronic constipation. The guidelines, which are based on 75 randomized controlled trials and four systematic reviews, target healthy adults with chronic idiopathic constipation—commonly affecting 1 in 6 to 7 people globally and 9% to 20% of U.S. adults. The study emphasizes targeted dietary interventions over general fiber advice, with kiwifruit being highlighted for its ease of use, low tolerance for adverse effects, and ability to improve stool movement, digestion, and gut health. Alternatives include prunes, flaxseeds, yogurt, and oatmeal. Supplements like psyllium (10g/day) and physical activity such as walking are also recommended. The guidelines do not apply to individuals with constipation due to neurological conditions, pregnancy, or children, and caution is advised due to the lack of focus on underlying medical causes.",
