  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government shutdown has left national parks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and those in West Virginia partially open despite furloughed National Park Service employees. While some local businesses report no immediate impact, others face declining bookings. Tourists continue to visit, leading to concerns about safety, illegal activities such as drone use and base jumping, and environmental degradation like trash buildup. In Washington, D.C., closures of the Smithsonian and National Zoo have shifted tourist traffic to private museums, boosting their visitor numbers. Advocacy groups warn that without adequate staffing, parks face serious safety risks, including reduced emergency response and increased vandalism. The economic impact on local communities—such as in West Virginia and D.C.—is significant, with tourism revenue and small business operations affected. The situation underscores a growing debate over whether parks should remain open or close during shutdowns to protect public safety and preserve park integrity.",
