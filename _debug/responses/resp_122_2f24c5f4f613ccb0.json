  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon’s cloud computing service, AWS, experienced a major outage that began early Monday morning and lasted through the day, affecting a wide range of online services including social media, gaming, financial platforms, streaming services, and education platforms. The outage was traced to problems in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which is essential for converting web addresses into accessible internet addresses. As a result, services such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, Netflix, Disney+, Coinbase, and Signal became unavailable, while Amazon’s own services like Ring, Alexa, and Kindle also failed. The incident caused significant disruption in education, with students and instructors at universities including the University of California, Riverside, Ohio State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte unable to access course materials or submit assignments. Experts noted that the slow and bumpy recovery process is typical after large-scale infrastructure failures, comparing it to a power outage. This event underscores the growing dependency of modern society on a handful of tech companies for internet infrastructure, revealing the systemic risks of centralized cloud computing. While no cyberattack was suspected, the outage highlights the fragility of the internet's backbone and the need for redundancy and resilience in critical services.",
