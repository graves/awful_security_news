  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump called on both Kyiv and Moscow to 'stop where they are' and end the war, advocating a ceasefire at current battle lines. This marks a significant shift from his earlier support for Ukraine to reclaim lost territory, as he now suggests that both sides should accept the current frontlines as permanent. Trump expressed hesitation in supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Kyiv sees as vital for striking deep into Russian territory and pressuring Putin to negotiate. Zelenskyy acknowledged the need for a ceasefire and supported the idea of ending the war, but emphasized that Ukraine still requires Tomahawks due to operational limitations. The article also highlights Trump's plan to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, as a potential path to direct negotiations, despite ongoing Russian bombardment and lack of engagement from Putin. The developments reflect a major pivot in U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine, balancing military aid concerns with a renewed emphasis on diplomatic peace.",
