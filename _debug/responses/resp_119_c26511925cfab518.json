    "A classified network of SpaceX satellites known as Starshield is emitting signals in the 2025–2110 MHz frequency range, which is normally reserved for uplinking data from Earth to satellites, not for receiving signals from space.",
    "The signals appear to be downlink transmissions from space to Earth, contradicting international standards set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).",
    "Amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley in Canada first detected the anomaly while scanning radio frequencies during a routine keyboard reset, suggesting the discovery was accidental.",
    "The signals have been detected from 170 Starshield satellites, indicating a widespread and consistent pattern of transmission.",
    "The downlink use of a protected frequency may be intended to conceal operations or avoid detection, potentially to maintain operational security in a classified system.",
    "The transmission frequency shifts frequently, making it difficult for outsiders to track or analyze the signal, which may further obscure the purpose.",
    "Experts such as Kevin Gifford suggest the signals may be a technical oversight rather than intentional interference, though the potential for radio-frequency interference with other satellites remains a concern.",
    "The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) operates the Starshield satellites for the government, and SpaceX has not publicly addressed the issue.",
    "The Starshield program is a classified version of SpaceX’s Starlink network, designed for Earth observation and secure communications, with over $1.8 billion in U.S. government spending to date.",
    "The use of a low-frequency band (closer to 3G cellular speeds) suggests limited data transmission capacity, which may reflect the operational needs of a classified mission rather than high-bandwidth internet services."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A classified SpaceX satellite network, Starshield, is transmitting downlink signals in the 2025–2110 MHz frequency band, which is internationally designated for uplink transmissions from Earth to satellites. This violation of the International Telecommunication Union's standards could interfere with other satellites and raise concerns about radio frequency interference. The signals were first detected by amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley in Canada during an accidental radio scan and have since been observed from 170 satellites. Experts suggest the transmissions may be designed to conceal operations or take advantage of a quiet spectrum, though it remains unclear whether they have caused significant disruption. The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office operates the Starshield satellites, and SpaceX has not responded to inquiries. The discovery has prompted calls for transparency, as these objects in classified orbits could impact the functionality of other space-based systems.",
