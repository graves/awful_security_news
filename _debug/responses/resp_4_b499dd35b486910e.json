  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance visits Israel to reinforce US support for a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as administration officials fear the deal may collapse after a Hamas-linked attack killed two Israeli soldiers. The US, through officials like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is working to ensure Israel responds proportionally to attacks and maintains commitment to the truce. Despite accusations from both sides of violating the agreement, both Israel and Hamas have reaffirmed their support for the ceasefire. Trump has disputed the attack's origin, claiming it was not orchestrated by Hamas leadership, and threatened to 'eradicate' the group if it continues to act aggressively. The next 30 days are seen as critical for the ceasefire to survive and for negotiations to move into a second phase, with Israel pushing for US-led demilitarization of Hamas before reconstruction talks begin.",
