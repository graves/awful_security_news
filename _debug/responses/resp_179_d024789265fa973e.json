    "President Donald Trump has announced the demolition of parts of the White House East Wing to build a new $250 million ballroom, which he claims will be 'near' but not touching the existing structure.",
    "The new ballroom is described as a private project funded by 'many generous Patriots,' though no specific individuals or organizations have been named.",
    "The White House East Wing, built in 1902 and last altered in 1942, is being physically altered with demolition of the covered entryway and windows, visible from the south side.",
    "Construction began on Monday, October 21, 2025, with Clark Construction hired to execute the work and McCrery Architects responsible for the design.",
    "The project has sparked criticism from the National Park Service, the Society of Architectural Historians, and the American Institute of Architects, who argue that it bypasses standard review processes and risks altering a historically significant structure.",
    "Critics, including Robert K. Sutton, former chief historian of the National Park Service, express concern that the project lacks due process, transparency, and historical sensitivity.",
    "Trump has previously emphasized that the new ballroom will respect the existing building and will not interfere with it, though the demolition of structural elements contradicts this claim.",
    "The ballroom is expected to host up to 900 people, with features including gold chandeliers and seating for hundreds, reflecting grand state event standards.",
    "The White House, though administered by the National Park Service, allows broad presidential authority for renovations, though experts warn that such power should be exercised with historical accountability.",
    "This project echoes past renovations by past presidents—such as Truman’s full reconstruction, Nixon’s conversion of the pool into a press room, and Obama’s tennis court adaptation—showing that the White House is a dynamic site of political and historical transformation."

The project, privately funded by unnamed 'generous Patriots,' has been criticized by the National Park Service, the Society of Architectural Historians, and the American Institute of Architects for bypassing standard review processes and altering a historic landmark without due diligence. The East Wing, built in 1902 and last modified in 1942, is being gutted, with construction beginning in September 2025 and led by Clark Construction and McCrery Architects. Critics, including former NPS historian Robert K.

The project raises broader concerns about the balance between presidential initiative and institutional safeguards in preserving the White House as a symbol of American governance.",
