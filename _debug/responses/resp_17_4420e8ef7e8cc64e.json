  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's plans for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no plans for such a meeting in the immediate future. This reversal follows a prior announcement that a meeting would happen within two weeks, after a phone call between the leaders. Diplomatic efforts involving Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were considered productive, but officials now believe that Lavrov lacks influence over key decisions, making a standalone meeting unnecessary. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date was set, so it cannot be postponed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia's diplomatic interest in peace is tied to Ukraine's access to long-range missile capabilities. Despite the pause, the Trump administration remains committed to brokering peace in Ukraine, and future talks may occur at a multilateral ASEAN event. The shift reflects broader uncertainty about diplomatic progress and underscores the importance of military capabilities in shaping negotiation outcomes.",
