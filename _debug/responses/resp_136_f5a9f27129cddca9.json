  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is beginning a five-year prison sentence at Paris' La Santé prison after being convicted of criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 election campaign. This marks the first time in living memory that a former French president has been imprisoned. Despite maintaining his innocence and protesting the decision, Sarkozy will serve time without awaiting an appeal, due to the judge’s determination that the offense severely disrupted public order. He will be held in a 9-square-meter cell, possibly in the VIP section, with limited personal belongings, including family photos and three books. Former inmates like Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological and physical shock of incarceration, emphasizing that even former leaders are subject to the same conditions as other prisoners. The case has sparked public attention, with Sarkozy’s son organizing a rally and his wife sharing social media posts in support. The article highlights both the political significance and the human dimensions of the incarceration.",
