  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has restricted users from generating AI videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after the King estate raised concerns about 'disrespectful depictions' such as fake videos showing King engaging in racist or offensive behavior. The Sora app, launched three weeks earlier, enabled deepfakes of numerous public figures—including Princess Diana, JFK, Kurt Cobain, and Malcolm X—without prior consent, sparking widespread criticism from legal experts, families of deceased celebrities, and Hollywood stakeholders. While OpenAI maintains that free speech supports deepfakes, it now asserts that estates should have ultimate control over how their likenesses are portrayed. The incident reflects broader ethical debates over AI-generated content, intellectual property rights, and the balance between innovation and respect for public figures' legacies, especially in the context of evolving laws like California’s 70-year rights-to-likeness provisions.",
