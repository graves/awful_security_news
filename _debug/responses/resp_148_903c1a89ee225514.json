    "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a formal warning against using AI chatbots to determine political voting decisions, citing their 'highly distorted and polarised' outputs.",
    "Testing of four major AI chatbots—ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—revealed that these models frequently recommended fringe parties like the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left-Labour Party, while downplaying centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy.",
    "The AI models were found to be biased and unreliable, with more than half of the cases recommending hard-right or left-wing parties, and some party groupings being almost never suggested.",
    "The warning emphasizes that AI systems lack transparency and verifiability, which undermines democratic integrity by potentially distorting voter choice.",
    "The Dutch Data Protection Authority urges both voters and chatbot providers to refrain from using AI as a voting advisory tool due to risks to free and fair elections.",
    "The upcoming election follows political instability caused by the Party for Freedom’s refusal to support coalition governments after rejecting a 10-point immigration plan, increasing public scrutiny over political polarization and AI influence."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using artificial intelligence chatbots to decide how to vote, after testing four major models—ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—and finding that they consistently recommend extreme political parties such as the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left-Labour Party, while largely ignoring centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. The watchdog argues that AI systems offer unreliable, biased, and non-transparent political advice, which could distort democratic decision-making. This warning comes as the Netherlands prepares for a parliamentary election on October 29, following political instability caused by the PVV’s refusal to support a coalition government over immigration policy. The authority urges both voters and AI providers to avoid using chatbots as voting guides to preserve the integrity of free and fair elections.",
