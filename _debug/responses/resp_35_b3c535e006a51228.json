  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government remains shut down as of October 2025, marking a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This is the first such full shutdown in recent years and contrasts with the 35-day partial shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019, which was the longest in nearly 50 years and cost an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The 2018 shutdown affected about 800,000 workers, with 300,000 furloughed and others exempt from pay. The current shutdown is attributed to a deeply divided Congress, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson leading a narrow House majority and the party lacking the 60 votes to overcome Senate filibusters. The article highlights the growing political polarization and institutional challenges that prevent timely resolution of funding disputes, which has significant economic and societal implications beyond Washington.",
