  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major influence in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Mikie Sherrill are directly leveraging Trump’s name and policies in their campaigns — Ciattarelli by invoking his support, and Sherrill by criticizing his actions, such as canceling the $16 billion Gateway tunnel. The races reflect broader political dynamics, including voter fatigue, shifts in swing areas like Passaic County, and the potential for 'voters’ remorse' as Democrats seek to rebuild support. The outcomes may provide critical insights into how Trump’s presence — even unofficially — affects voter behavior and party strength ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
