  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown, tourists continue to visit national parks such as Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and New River Gorge despite closures, lack of entrance fees, and reduced staffing. While some local businesses report stability, others like Mountain Mama in West Virginia see declining bookings. The absence of park rangers has led to safety concerns, including illegal drone flights, base jumping, and trash accumulation, with advocacy groups urging park closures. In Washington, DC, the shutdown has shifted tourist traffic to private museums like Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum, which have seen significant visitor increases. The shutdown has also led to economic losses, with Destination DC estimating a $47.4 million revenue loss in a prior instance. The article underscores the tension between public access and safety, and the critical role of local economies in sustaining national park tourism.",
