  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A class action lawsuit has been filed in US District Court in Oregon, alleging that On, a Swiss athletic shoe company, marketed its CloudTec sneakers—such as the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner models—as 'running on clouds' while failing to address a persistent and embarrassing squeaking sound. Customers, including nurses and other professionals, claim the noise disrupts daily life and that the company engaged in deceptive marketing by not offering refunds, repairs, or design fixes despite being aware of the issue. The plaintiffs argue that the shoes are fundamentally unwearable without DIY modifications, such as applying coconut oil, and that the company’s failure to act constitutes a breach of consumer trust. The lawsuit reflects growing consumer dissatisfaction, amplified by social media posts on TikTok and Reddit, and highlights a contradiction between On’s strong financial performance and public discontent over product quality.",
