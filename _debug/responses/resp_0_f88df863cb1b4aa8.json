  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a powerful political force shaping the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are directly invoking Trump’s policies—such as the cancellation of the $16 billion Gateway tunnel—as central campaign themes, with Ciattarelli praising Trump’s leadership and Sherrill criticizing it as reckless. The race reflects broader political anxieties about economic impacts and voter realignment, particularly in Passaic County, where Trump won a narrow margin in 2024 after Biden’s strong 2020 victory. Democrats are banking on 'voters’ remorse' and policy backlash to regain ground, while Republicans use Trump’s name to energize their base. Virginia’s race, less affected by Trump’s direct involvement, shows a contrast in political engagement. These races are seen as early indicators of public sentiment toward Trump’s second term and could provide critical insights for both parties heading into the 2026 midterms.",
