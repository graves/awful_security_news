  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the ongoing full government shutdown in the United States, emphasizing that it is the first such event in a prolonged period without a spending agreement. It references the previous 2018 shutdown as the longest in nearly 50 years, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in GDP. The article explains that during that period, around 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and others exempted from pay. The current shutdown, caused by Congress failing to pass 12 appropriations bills, is a full shutdown affecting all federal operations. Political obstacles, such as the lack of a Senate majority to end a filibuster and a narrow House majority under Speaker Mike Johnson, have made negotiations difficult. The article underscores the economic and societal consequences of such events, including lost productivity and employee disruption, and highlights the role of partisan division in prolonging funding gaps.",
