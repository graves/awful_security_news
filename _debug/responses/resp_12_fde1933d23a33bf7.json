The dispute centers on whether SpaceX will retain its contract or face competition from other companies, with Musk defending SpaceX’s achievements and supporting Jared Isaacman, a former SpaceX pilot, as a potential NASA administrator. While Duffy clarified he has no interest in becoming NASA’s permanent leader and only suggested a potential structural reorganization of NASA into the Department of Transportation, the controversy highlights tensions between private space companies and federal space policy, especially amid growing competition with China in lunar exploration.",
