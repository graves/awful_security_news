The map targets the district currently represented by Democrat Don Davis, one of the few Black members of Congress from the state. The move follows President Donald Trump’s nationwide push for GOP-led states to redraw district lines to prevent a Democratic takeover of the House. Republican lawmakers argue that the map defends the will of voters and counters decades of Democratic gerrymandering, while Democrats accuse the process of being politically motivated, driven by Trump's demands and undermining democratic integrity. The map now moves to the North Carolina House for final approval, with no veto power from Governor Josh Stein. The action reflects a broader national redistricting conflict, with similar efforts underway in Texas and California.",
