Though she lost a legal battle with World Aquatics in 2024, which ended her professional career, she continues to swim recreationally and emphasizes the importance of authenticity and self-acceptance. Her story highlights the broader societal challenges faced by transgender people, especially in high-profile sports, and underscores the message that 'it’s easier to fight the whole world than to fight yourself.'",
