This marks the second time in 2025 that the Colombian ambassador has been recalled, following a prior U.S. recall of its ambassador in July. The situation has deepened diplomatic tensions, with Petro accusing the U.S. of political interference and human rights violations, while Trump threatens to impose economic sanctions, including higher tariffs, on Colombian exports. The attacks have resulted in at least 30 deaths, with some victims reportedly being Colombian citizens, further fueling accusations that the U.S. is violating Colombian sovereignty.",
