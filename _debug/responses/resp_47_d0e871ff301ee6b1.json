  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America — primarily driven by Generation Z — has led to significant political changes, including the ousting of Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina, who was initially installed by the military in 2009. The movement, facilitated by social media, shares common roots in dissatisfaction with corruption, economic hardship, and lack of jobs. Similar uprisings occurred in Bangladesh (2024), Sri Lanka (2022), and Nepal (2025), while in Africa, movements like GenZ 212 in Morocco and protests in Kenya and Uganda show growing political assertiveness. Although Madagascar’s youth succeeded in toppling Rajoelina, the military now holds power under General Michael Randrianirina, indicating that youth action alone may not be sufficient without institutional support. Experts warn that these movements signal a shift in political power dynamics, with young Africans demanding accountability and reforms. African leaders, especially those in long-standing or military regimes, are increasingly on alert, as youth activism could become more widespread and persistent.",
