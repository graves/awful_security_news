These strikes have caused widespread blackouts and civilian deaths, including two in Novhorod-Siverskyi. Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of deliberately prolonging suffering by circling damaged sites with drones, making repairs unsafe. In response, Ukraine is seeking urgent European aid, including air defense systems and financial support from frozen Russian assets—worth $200 billion—while launching retaliatory strikes on Russian facilities like the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Zelensky is turning to European allies for both military and diplomatic support, expressing concern that a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban could be detrimental. Analysts note that Russian aggression increases when US pressure on Russia decreases, suggesting a strategic pattern tied to shifts in US leadership, especially under Donald Trump.",
