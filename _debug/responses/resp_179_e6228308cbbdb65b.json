  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the health crisis in Gaza constitutes a 'catastrophe' that will persist for generations due to famine, destroyed healthcare infrastructure, and widespread mental health issues. Despite a ceasefire with Hamas that began on 10 October 2025, aid deliveries remain critically insufficient—only 200 to 300 lorries per day instead of the required 600—with supplies often confiscated or restricted by Israeli authorities. Dr. Tedros emphasizes that aid must be delivered without conditions, especially after the release of Israeli hostages and the partial return of remains, and calls for all available crossings—including Kerem Shalom and Kissufim—to be fully opened. The UN estimates $70 billion is needed to rebuild Gaza, with 10% dedicated to health infrastructure. Thousands of Palestinians have died waiting for medical evacuation flights, highlighting the urgent need for increased access and action. The US, as the broker of the ceasefire, is expected to enforce it and ensure unrestricted humanitarian access, while Israel continues to face pressure to allow aid groups previously denied registration to operate.",
