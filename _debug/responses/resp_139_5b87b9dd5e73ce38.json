  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, citing that these models provide distorted, polarized, and biased political advice. Tests revealed that AI systems frequently recommend extreme parties such as the Party for Freedom (PVV) or the Green Left-Labour Party, while mainstream centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the VVD are rarely suggested. The authority emphasizes that AI-generated political advice lacks transparency and verifiability, directly undermining the integrity of democratic elections. This warning comes ahead of the October 29 parliamentary election, which follows political instability caused by the PVV’s withdrawal from coalition talks over immigration policy, and highlights growing concerns about the role of artificial intelligence in shaping public political decisions.",
