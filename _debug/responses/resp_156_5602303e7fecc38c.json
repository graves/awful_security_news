  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser, has been dismissed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid growing political and strategic tensions over Israel’s military strategy in Gaza. Hanegbi, who had opposed a full military takeover of Gaza City and advocated for a partial deal with Hamas, publicly admitted responsibility for the failures that led to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation. Netanyahu appointed Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, as acting head of the NSC, reflecting a shift toward more loyalist leadership. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accused the government of evading accountability and replacing dissenting voices with compliant officials. The incident underscores deep divisions within Israel’s security establishment and highlights ongoing concerns about transparency and responsibility in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack.",
