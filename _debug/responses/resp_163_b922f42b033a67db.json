    "The White House East Wing is undergoing massive demolition to build a new ballroom, marking the first structural change since 1948 and the first under President Donald Trump.",
    "The proposed ballroom is estimated to cost $250 million, though earlier reports cited $200 million; Trump claims it will be funded entirely privately, without taxpayer cost.",
    "The new ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet (8,360 square meters), with a seating capacity of about 650–999 guests, significantly larger than the current East Room (which seats ~200).",
    "The project began despite not being formally approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a government shutdown.",
    "The East Wing, originally added in 1902 and used since 1977 for first lady offices and visitor access, will be reconstructed without demolition of the main White House building.",
    "Construction is being led by McCrery Architects, with Clark Construction handling building work and AECOM providing engineering services.",
    "The project has drawn skepticism due to its scale, lack of formal approval, and claims of private funding, which have not been verified or disclosed.",
    "Trump has emphasized that the new ballroom will not interfere with the original structure and will respect the historic integrity of the White House."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated a major structural renovation of the White House East Wing to build a new ballroom, marking the first such change since 1948. The project, estimated at $250 million and funded privately, began in October 2025 despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The ballroom, set to seat up to 999 guests, will be located within the two-story East Wing—originally constructed in 1902 and previously used for first lady offices and diplomatic events—while preserving the main White House structure. The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM. Trump has emphasized that the project respects the historical integrity of the building and will not impact the main structure or cost taxpayers. However, the lack of regulatory approval and unverified private funding have raised public skepticism. The construction is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s term in January 2029, during which time offices will be temporarily relocated.",
