  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown, Capitol Police officers are working without pay, highlighting the human cost of legislative deadlock. The officers, who are asked to serve as both enforcers and hosts, are especially vulnerable due to financial instability and political disrespect — including the failure to oppose President Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters and the delayed installation of a memorial plaque honoring their bravery. Lawmakers, including Senator Katie Britt and Representative Joe Morelle, are divided on responsibility, with Morelle criticizing the lack of negotiation and perceived insincerity in political gestures. Despite enduring these challenges, officers continue to perform their duties, though one officer warns that morale may not hold up beyond a month. The situation underscores the broader implications of political inaction on public servants who protect democratic institutions.",
