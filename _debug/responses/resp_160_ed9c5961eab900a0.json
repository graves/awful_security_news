  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—passed down through generations—plays a vital role in preventing loss of life from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), despite the government's investment in early warning systems (EWS). Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on natural signs such as thunder, rainfall, and gunfire to detect and alert communities to floods, often outperforming malfunctioning or poorly implemented technological systems. The government’s $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017 has failed to gain trust due to lack of real-time connectivity, poor community engagement, and frequent equipment failures. With Pakistan experiencing rapid warming and a projected increase in glacial melt, these traditional practices remain essential. Experts, including the NDMA and UNDP, highlight systemic issues such as weak institutional capacity and communication gaps that undermine technology-based solutions. The article underscores the urgent need for inclusive, community-centered adaptation strategies that respect and integrate Indigenous knowledge in climate resilience.",
