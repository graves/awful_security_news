  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security sparked a major backlash by posting a social media message calling immigrants to 'remigrate' using a self-deportation app, a move experts warn is deeply problematic due to the term's historical and ideological roots. The concept of 'remigration' originates in Nazi-era antisemitic policies, such as the Madagascar Plan, and has been co-opted by far-right conspiracy theories—especially the 'Great Replacement Theory'—which falsely claims that non-white populations are being replaced by immigrants. This ideology has inspired violent attacks in Norway, Christchurch, El Paso, and Buffalo. In Europe, countries like Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni have implemented aggressive remigration policies, deporting asylum-seekers to Albania and targeting even children born in Italy. These practices have drawn legal scrutiny, including a 2025 ruling by the European Court of Justice requiring that asylum-seekers not be sent to dangerous conditions. Experts like Cynthia Miller-Idriss and Jakob Guhl emphasize that the term 'remigration' is a 'dog whistle' used strategically to promote ethnic homogeneity and could be interpreted as endorsing violent or coercive xenophobia, raising serious concerns about how such language is used in public policy and democratic discourse.",
