  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man, Ian Cleary, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman, Shannon Keeler, at Gettysburg College in 2013. The case, which had been dormant for over a decade, was revived when Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you' in 2019, prompting Keeler to re-engage with law enforcement. After being extradited from France in 2024, Cleary pleaded guilty and expressed remorse, citing a 12-step program for mental health. Judge Kevin Hess considered Cleary’s mental illness and remorse in issuing a sentence below state guidelines. Keeler’s long fight to see justice delivered — including a powerful courtroom statement about systemic failures in prosecuting campus sexual assault — highlighted the trauma survivors endure and the failure of institutions to act in time.",
