  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, a growing number of institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth, and the University of Virginia—have rejected the agreement. The Compact demands policies such as banning transgender students from sports and restrooms, freezing tuition, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized tests for admissions. These universities argue that such policies contradict academic integrity, scientific merit, and the principles of fair and merit-based education. The White House held a virtual meeting with several schools to negotiate, but dissent has only increased, with leaders asserting that federal funding should not be tied to political conformity. This situation reflects broader tensions between federal policy and academic independence in higher education, especially in the context of past cancellations of research grants over DEI and transgender-related issues.",
