  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, amid growing tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza and disagreements over military strategy, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his support for a partial deal with Hamas. Hanegbi, who served as adviser since 2023, publicly admitted responsibility for failures leading to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation to restore public trust. Netanyahu has appointed Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, as acting head of the NSC. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accused the government of evading accountability and replacing officials with compliant allies. This leadership change reflects deeper divisions within Israel’s security and political elite over how to manage the ongoing Gaza conflict and the response to the October 7 attack.",
