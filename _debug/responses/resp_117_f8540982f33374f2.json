  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During an ongoing government shutdown in October 2025, Capitol Police officers have been working without pay, missing their first full paycheck on October 10. The situation highlights the human toll of political gridlock, as officers balance high-risk enforcement duties with public-facing responsibilities like guiding visitors. Former Capitol Police Chief Terry Gainer emphasizes the immense pressure of the job, especially amid rising threats to public officials. Senator Katie Britt expresses sympathy for the officers, blaming Democrats for the shutdown, while Representative Joe Morelle criticizes the lack of negotiation and political disrespect—such as the support for President Trump’s pardons of January 6 rioters and the delayed installation of a memorial plaque honoring Capitol Police bravery. The Capitol Police union, led by Gus Papathanasiou, has called on lawmakers to end the shutdown, and tensions escalated after a brief confrontation between Representative Nanette Barragán and an officer. Despite their professionalism, officers express uncertainty about how long they can endure the conditions, with one stating that their resilience may last only a month. The Trump administration has proposed repurposing funds to pay law enforcement, but Democrats argue such actions may be illegal and fail to address deeper issues of accountability and respect.",
