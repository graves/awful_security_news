  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche calendar references (Juche 89, equivalent to 2000), was recovered from a drone used in an attack on Kherson, Ukraine, in September 2024. The submunition, originally intended for rocket artillery, was repurposed for use on a first-person-view drone using simple materials like wire and duct tape. This discovery, analyzed by the UK-based Conflict Armament Research (CAR), establishes a direct material link between North Korea and the war in Ukraine. It follows a broader pattern of North Korea's increasing military engagement with Russia, including the deployment of approximately 12,000 troops to Russia since 2024, with around 4,000 reported killed or wounded. Meanwhile, Russia has intensified its drone attacks on Ukrainian cities to overwhelm defenses and undermine civilian morale, using mass-produced, low-tech drones. This report underscores the growing international reach of North Korea’s military capabilities and its role in supporting Russia’s war efforts in Europe.",
