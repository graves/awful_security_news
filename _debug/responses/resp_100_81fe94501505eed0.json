    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and describes the devolution of internet platforms from user-friendly, innovative services into exploitative, profit-driven systems that degrade user and business experiences.",
    "Doctorow outlines three stages of enshittification: Stage 1 (user acquisition with attractive offers), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user expense), and Stage 3 (excessive fees, poor search quality, and data exploitation that harms both users and merchants).",
    "Amazon and Facebook are cited as central examples of enshittification, with Doctorow alleging that Amazon clones products, charges junk fees (up to 51 cents per dollar earned), and degrades search quality, while Facebook manipulates feeds and forces publishers to publish longer excerpts of content.",
    "The core reasons Doctorow identifies for this degradation are lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, including the long-standing 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Doctorow proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing users to take e-books with them), increased interoperability between platforms (e.g., allowing Android apps on iPhones or cross-platform messaging), and stronger antitrust enforcement to reverse enshittification."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces the concept of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms from user-friendly, innovative services into exploitative, profit-driven systems — in his new book. He outlines a three-stage process: first, platforms attract users with attractive deals (Stage 1); then, they favor business partners at user expense (Stage 2); and finally, they impose excessive fees, manipulate algorithms, and degrade search quality to extract profits (Stage 3). Facebook and Amazon are cited as key examples, with Doctorow claiming that Facebook manipulates content feeds and Amazon clones products and charges merchants as much as 51 cents per dollar earned. The theory is rooted in a lack of competition and weak regulation, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. Doctorow proposes solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations and increased interoperability between platforms to reverse enshittification, which has gained momentum in political and consumer advocacy circles, even among conservatives.",
