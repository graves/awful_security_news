    "Around 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015, with the practice of early introduction being adopted by more pediatricians and allergists over time.",
    "Early exposure to peanuts and other allergenic foods (e.g., milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts, tree nut butters) may help the immune system build tolerance.",
    "Despite progress, about 8% of children still have food allergies, including over 2% with peanut allergies, indicating that full adoption and impact remain ongoing."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research shows a significant real-world decline in allergy rates in the U.S. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in children under age 3 have dropped by over 27%, rising to more than 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records and found that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies due to early exposure recommendations. The guidelines, first issued in 2015 and updated in 2021, recommend introducing peanuts and other allergens between four and six months of age without prior screening. Despite initial hesitation among medical professionals and parents, adoption has grown, with increasing numbers of pediatricians and allergists following the practice. Experts like Dr. Gideon Lack and advocacy groups such as FARE highlight the scientific and public health significance of early allergen exposure in reducing food allergy incidence.",
