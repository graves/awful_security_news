  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central projects that, even under current emission commitments, the world will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of extreme heat—due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days projected under a pre-Paris warming trajectory of 4°C. Since 2015, the planet has already seen 11 extra superhot days. However, the study reveals a stark global inequity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure—up to 149 extra days annually—despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions. In contrast, the world’s top carbon emitters—the U.S., China, and India—account for 42% of global emissions but face only 23–30 extra superhot days. Experts warn that this growing disparity could deepen global inequality and trigger geopolitical instability.",
