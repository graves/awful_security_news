The thieves, described as professional and well-prepared, used a truck with an elevating platform and a disc-cutter to enter the gallery in under seven minutes. One crown was dropped and later recovered damaged. The incident raises serious concerns about the security of French cultural artifacts, especially given prior thefts of gold and porcelain in 2025. Authorities attribute the motive to financial gain, as crown items can be broken down and sold for profit. A new security plan is being implemented in response to the growing audacity of art theft gangs targeting high-value, sellable items rather than iconic paintings.",
