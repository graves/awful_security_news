This marks the first reported instance of survivors from such an attack. The US government, led by President Donald Trump and Secretary Marco Rubio, justified the strike as targeting a 'drug-carrying submarine' used for massive cocaine smuggling, calling the operation necessary to combat narco-terrorism. In response, Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro accused the US of attempting to turn Venezuela into an 'American colony', while UN-appointed experts have condemned the attacks as 'extrajudicial executions'. Trinidad and Tobago has launched an investigation into the deaths of two of its citizens, believed to have been killed in the attack. The broader context includes a recent surge in US military activity in the Caribbean, with approximately 10,000 US troops stationed and B-52 bombers patrolling the region. The US has also reportedly authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela, signaling a significant escalation in geopolitical tension between the two nations.",
