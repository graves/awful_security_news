Hapoel criticized the police decision, accusing them of overreacting and taking a militarized approach. This incident follows prior security concerns, including a ban on Maccabi fans in England due to their history of violent behavior, which drew criticism from UK leaders like Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who emphasized the need for inclusivity and safety in sports. The UK government has now initiated dialogue with Israeli authorities to understand the Tel Aviv events and address shared concerns about fan safety and cross-border policing.",
