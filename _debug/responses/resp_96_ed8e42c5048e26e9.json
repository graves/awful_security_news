  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amid a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, will run out of funds by early November. Approximately 42 million Americans are at risk of losing access to critical food assistance during this period. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins attributed the funding shortfall to political disagreements, particularly blaming Democrats for prioritizing their agenda over food security. The program's $6 billion contingency fund is insufficient to cover the $8 billion needed for November benefits. While the Trump administration used $300 million in tariff revenue to sustain the WIC program, it lacks the funds to support SNAP. As a result, 17 states have suspended new food stamp applications, and advocacy groups warn that the shutdown endangers vulnerable families, especially as Thanksgiving approaches. The situation reflects a broader political standoff between Republicans and Democrats over federal spending and highlights the urgent need for action to protect basic food security.",
