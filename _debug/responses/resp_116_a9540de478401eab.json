  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to respond to the Trump administration's proposed 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' approaches, a growing number of institutions — including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia — have rejected the agreement. The Compact would require schools to enforce gender-based restroom and sports policies, freeze tuition, limit international enrollment, and mandate standardized admissions tests. Critics argue that such policies compromise academic freedom and scientific merit, and that tying federal funding to political conditions undermines research integrity and educational equity. Despite White House outreach and a virtual meeting with several universities, no institution has agreed to sign the Compact. The broader significance lies in the resistance of elite universities to politically mandated policies, signaling a major challenge to the administration's efforts to influence higher education through funding leverage.",
