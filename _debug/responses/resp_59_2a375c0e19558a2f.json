  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman missing for about two weeks, were discovered behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia, confirmed through DNA testing. The discovery followed an anonymous tip prompting a re-examination of the site. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possibly homicide. Evidence including cellphone location data and video footage of a stolen Hyundai Accent—seen parked near the scene—links King to the case. The vehicle was later found on fire and compacted, limiting forensic analysis. Prosecutors say additional charges are pending and suspect possible involvement of others. The case remains under investigation, with ongoing legal proceedings and public concern due to the tragic nature of Scott’s disappearance and the severity of the charges against King.",
