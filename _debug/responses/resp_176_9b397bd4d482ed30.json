  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has been able to afford living in Royal Lodge due to a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate in which he paid approximately £8 million in upfront lump sum payments for renovations and future rent obligations, effectively eliminating annual rent. The lease, which lasts until 2078, includes strict maintenance requirements and prohibitions on helicopters and gambling. Despite criticism from political figures like Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick over the perceived lack of accountability, the arrangement was deemed financially sound by the National Audit Office, as it prevented taxpayer-funded 'grace and favour' spending. The deal has come under renewed scrutiny due to controversy over Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein and allegations detailed in Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, raising questions about his lifestyle and moral responsibilities, especially as the royal family seeks to distance itself from his presence. The lease also allows for continued occupancy by Prince Andrew’s ex-wife and daughters, with financial returns tapering to zero after 25 years, and will expire in 2078.",
