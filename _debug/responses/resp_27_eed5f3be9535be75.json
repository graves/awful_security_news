  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to the island of Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where heavy rainfall—potentially exceeding one foot—could trigger flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico could experience significant rain, though a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely. The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two scenarios under consideration: a northward turn toward Hispaniola or a westward path toward Central America. The increasing intensity of storms like Melissa is linked to climate change, with warmer ocean waters and recent trends of rapid intensification—seen in storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto—highlighting a growing climate-related risk to the Caribbean and beyond.",
