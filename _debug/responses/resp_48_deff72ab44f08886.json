    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, writer, and public activist, shot at Fico five times from a distance of less than 1 meter during a public appearance in Handlova.",
    "The court ruled that Cintula’s act constituted a terrorist act, not just a murder or attack on a public official, citing the specific targeting of a political leader.",
    "Cintula claimed he aimed to stop Fico’s policies, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and stated his intention was to hurt, not kill.",
    "The verdict reflects deep societal divisions in Slovakia between the populist Fico and the liberal, pro-EU opposition.",
    "Fico, who has been in power since 2006, has accused the opposition of fostering anger and undermining democratic standards, while the opposition claims Fico has eroded media freedom and covered up corruption.",
    "Cintula expressed his intention to appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust' and stating that the court mischaracterized the nature of the attack.",
    "The sentence, while less than the maximum life imprisonment, reflects the court’s determination that the act was politically motivated and terroristic.",
    "Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula despite ongoing health issues from the attack."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public appearance in Handlova. Cintula, who admitted to shooting Fico five times, claimed his motive was to stop Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, which he believed threatened Slovak freedom. The court ruled the act constituted terrorism due to its specific targeting of a political leader, rejecting the defense’s argument that it was merely a violent attack on a public official. The verdict reflects deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of inciting anger and the opposition blaming him for undermining democracy. Despite ongoing health issues, Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula, while Cintula expressed his intention to appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust'. The case has drawn international attention and highlights tensions between political power, civil liberties, and violent protest in modern democracies.",
