  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI director, has launched a legal defense against federal charges of lying and obstructing a congressional proceeding, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawful due to bypassing Senate confirmation after the 120-day interim limit. Comey’s attorneys claim that Trump has publicly attacked him in retaliation for his criticism of the administration, and they point to the dismissal of Trump’s own indictment in Florida — over similar constitutional grounds — as precedent. They also request access to the Justice Department’s prosecutorial decisions to show selective prosecution. The case raises significant constitutional and political questions about executive power, retaliation, and the integrity of the justice system.",
