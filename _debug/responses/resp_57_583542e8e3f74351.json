  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine after a four-week blackout, the longest since the war began. The restoration effort follows the establishment of rare 'ceasefire zones' by the UN, enabling the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to coordinate repairs. The IAEA director Rafael Grossi stressed that off-site power is vital for nuclear safety, and both Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the outage—Ukraine accusing Russia of intentional power cuts to test grid reconnection, while Russia blames Ukrainian shelling. The plant has suffered ten grid outages since the war began, and recent Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including a strike on a substation in Slavutych, have raised concerns about cascading risks to other nuclear facilities. Ukrainian officials maintain that Russian military aggression and occupation are the root causes of radiation threats in Europe, while Russian-controlled plant staff claim that military protection is essential to carry out repairs amid active shelling.",
