  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, France's first former president to go to jail, begins a five-year prison sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 presidential campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Though he was not personally found guilty of receiving funds, he was convicted of criminal association with aides Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, who arranged secret meetings with Gaddafi’s intelligence officials through intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine. Sarkozy has appealed the conviction, maintains his innocence, and claims the imprisonment reflects a political vendetta rather than justice. He is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, with limited contact and restricted movement. The French government, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, has expressed public support and acknowledged the gravity of the situation. A final decision on the appeal will be made by France’s highest administrative court in late November 2025.",
