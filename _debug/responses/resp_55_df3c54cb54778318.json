  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has proposed a funding compact for nine U.S. universities, offering expanded access to federal grants and invitations to White House events in exchange for policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment, and adopting specific gender definitions based on biology. Seven of the nine universities — including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and Dartmouth — have formally rejected the offer, arguing that such conditions threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House claims the compact promotes a more ideologically balanced higher education environment, while critics, including university leaders and scholars, see it as an overreach of federal power that undermines academic independence and innovation. The compact includes mandatory annual anonymous polls to enforce compliance and aims for initial signatories by November 21, 2025. As of October 20, 2025, several universities remain unresponsive or are reviewing the proposal, highlighting a growing national debate over the role of government in academic institutions.",
