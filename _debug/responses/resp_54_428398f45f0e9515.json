  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche calendar references indicating a 2000 production date, was found in a drone used to attack the Kherson port city in Ukraine in September 2025. The submunition, originally designed for rocket artillery, was modified using basic materials like wire and duct tape to be attached to a first-person-view drone. This discovery, reported by the UK-based Conflict Armament Research (CAR), establishes a direct material link between North Korea’s defense industry and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It comes amid reports of Russia’s massive drone production and attacks on Ukrainian cities, as well as North Korea’s increased military involvement, with around 12,000 troops reportedly deployed to Russia since 2024, of which about 4,000 have been killed or wounded. The finding underscores growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia in the conflict, raising international concerns over the proliferation of weapons and the global reach of the war.",
