  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank by requiring major nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) to re-register under new, ideologically driven criteria. These criteria, administered by COGAT and involving approval from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, allow for de-registration based on accusations of supporting 'terrorist groups' or inciting racism—often applied broadly to comments deemed antisemitic. As a result, organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps have been denied entry or registration, with some now forced to cease operations within 60 days. Meanwhile, Israel continues to ban the UNRWA from providing aid, despite evidence of no ties to Hamas, and has only approved a small number of ideologically driven or inexperienced aid groups. With only two of seven border crossings open and hundreds of aid trucks stranded in Egypt and Jordan, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, despite a ceasefire agreement brokered by the Trump administration that pledged increased aid delivery.",
