  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, was caused by a steel cable that failed to meet safety specifications and was not certified for passenger use. The cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, leading to a derailment, fatalities, and injuries. The Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) identified serious failures in the cable, maintenance, and braking systems, including falsified records of completed maintenance tasks. The operator, CARRIS, failed to ensure compliance with its own safety standards. Eyewitnesses described the incident as chaotic and terrifying, with one man named Bruno recalling a loud bang and visible smoke. While the interim findings are preliminary, the report highlights systemic failures in safety protocols and maintenance, prompting public concern about transportation safety in urban areas.",
