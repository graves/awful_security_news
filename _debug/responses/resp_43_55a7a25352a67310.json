  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 fatalities and several injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation on the historic Glória funicular. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) indicate that the cable failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator, CARRIS, and that maintenance tasks were falsified or not properly executed, with records falsely marked as compliant. Eyewitnesses described a chaotic, out-of-control descent, likening the event to a toy being thrown across the street. While the interim report highlights serious systemic failures in cable integrity, maintenance, and braking systems, it is noted as preliminary, with a final report expected next year. This incident raises global concerns about the safety standards and oversight of urban public transport systems.",
