  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, centered on a 100% tariff threat by US President Donald Trump in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its actions as a defense of national security, claiming the US has engaged in discriminatory trade restrictions. The US has a long history of imposing tariffs and export controls on Chinese goods, from 2018 to 2025, including a 100% tariff announced in October 2025. China’s restrictions on rare earths—critical for technology and defense—target US reliance on Chinese supply chains. Experts highlight that both nations are leveraging economic and technological tools, with China appearing more strategic and prepared, while the US has broader economic resilience. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is seen as a potential turning point, but the threat of escalation persists, with both sides maintaining a posture of strength and readiness to use retaliatory measures. The situation underscores a deepening rivalry where trade, technology, and national security are increasingly intertwined.",
