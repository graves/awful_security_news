  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced growing legal and political scrutiny after deciding to release two survivors from a failed military strike in the Caribbean, despite claims that they were 'narco-terrorists' involved in fentanyl trafficking. The release contradicts the administration’s narrative of a war with dangerous individuals and raises serious questions about the legality of its actions, especially without congressional approval or public evidence. Experts, including Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, have criticized the administration’s claim of war-like powers, noting a contradiction between the alleged threat and the decision to release the men. Colombian President Gustavo Petro and the victims’ families have challenged the administration’s claims, adding international skepticism. Lawmakers, including Republican Senator Todd Young, have expressed concern over the lack of transparency and legal basis, while the administration appears to have avoided accountability by choosing not to detain or prosecute the men—potentially to prevent legal challenges through habeas corpus or civilian courts. This has intensified bipartisan pressure on Congress to act, signaling a turning point in the debate over the legality and legitimacy of the strikes.",
