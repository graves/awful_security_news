  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s ambitious peace initiatives in Ukraine and the Middle East are faltering due to persistent intransigence from Russia and Hamas. Despite hopes of a breakthrough with Putin, a scheduled summit was abandoned after failed talks, and Russia resumed attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, confirming its unwillingness to make peace. Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is fragile, with renewed violence and Hamas retaliation threatening to collapse it. Vice President JD Vance’s rushed visit to the region aims to reinforce the ceasefire and pressure Hamas to comply with Trump’s 20-point peace plan, but no tangible progress has been made. The U.S. is attempting to push regional allies—like Qatar and Turkey—to act, though no state has committed to sending forces to Gaza. Experts stress that quick implementation of transitional institutions, such as a Palestinian technocratic administration and an International Stabilization Force, is essential to sustaining peace. Overall, Trump’s efforts are showing limited success, with both conflicts remaining unresolved and deeply entrenched in violence and distrust.",
