  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify both their social behavior and nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase their distance from foragers, showing proactive social distancing. The ants also build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with wider entrances and longer travel routes, which reduces disease transmission. This combination of behavioral and structural changes represents a form of 'architectural immunity' and marks the first known case of a non-human social species actively modifying its physical environment in response to disease. The research, published in the journal Science, suggests that principles observed in ant colonies could inspire new human-designed public spaces and urban planning strategies to reduce disease spread.",
