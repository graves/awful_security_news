  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—is significantly increasing the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% rise in retail coffee prices in August 2025. As the U.S. imports over 99% of its coffee, with Brazil being the largest supplier, these tariffs directly impact roasters like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting, who report higher bean prices and financial strain. Consumers in major cities like Washington, D.C., are seeing prices rise, though they are unlikely to abandon coffee due to its status as an affordable luxury. In response, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon and Rep. Ro Khanna, introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' to exempt coffee from tariffs, aiming to stabilize prices and protect consumers and small businesses facing unpredictable costs due to global supply chain disruptions and tariff volatility.",
