  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by 12 months, despite earlier approval in April 2024, due to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on countries supporting the global carbon tax on shipping, which led to a shift in voting patterns. The NZF would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess CO2 emissions from ships, promoting cleaner alternatives like ammonia and methanol. While countries including China, the EU, and Britain supported the initiative, Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it, and Argentina and Singapore changed their stance to delay implementation. The delay undermines global climate goals, as shipping emissions are a significant driver of climate change, and industry stakeholders warn that lack of clarity will stifle investment in decarbonization. The decision reflects a broader geopolitical tension between climate action and fossil fuel interests.",
