  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew’s ability to live in the sprawling Royal Lodge, a 30-room Grade II-listed mansion on the Windsor estate, stems from a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate in which he made substantial upfront payments totaling around £8 million — including £5 million for repairs and £2.5 million to buy out future rent obligations — effectively eliminating annual rent. Despite the property being under security restrictions that make commercial rental difficult, the arrangement was seen as financially beneficial to the Crown Estate, avoiding taxpayer-funded 'grace and favour' housing. The lease includes ongoing maintenance responsibilities, such as painting and landscaping, and prohibitions on helicopters and gambling. However, the deal has come under intense public and political scrutiny due to Prince Andrew’s controversial connection with Jeffrey Epstein and allegations involving Virginia Giuffre. Critics, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Robert Jenrick, and Lisa Smart, argue he should pay his fair share or return funds, while the National Audit Office confirmed the arrangement provided 'value for money'. The lease ends in 2078, with Prince Andrew’s ability to reclaim funds gradually decreasing over time, and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are entitled to continue using the property if he leaves.",
