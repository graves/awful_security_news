  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The British royal family is facing renewed public scrutiny following the posthumous release of Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' which alleges that Prince Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17, under the influence of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book details three alleged encounters, including one on Epstein’s Caribbean island with multiple underage girls, and claims that Andrew’s staff attempted to hire internet trolls to discredit her. Though Prince Andrew denies all claims and previously reached a 2022 settlement that acknowledged Giuffre’s trauma without admitting guilt, new evidence—including an email from 2011 indicating continued contact with Epstein—has fueled further criticism. The UK government and Buckingham Palace are under pressure to strip Andrew of his titles and remove him from royal duties. The memoir, which became a bestseller on Amazon, underscores ongoing concerns about power, accountability, and the role of royalty in protecting victims of sexual abuse.",
