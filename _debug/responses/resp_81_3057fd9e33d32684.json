  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 20, 2025, a coordinated heist occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole nine historically significant artifacts from the Apollo Gallery in just seven minutes. Among the stolen items are a sapphire diadem and necklace from Napoleon’s second wife Marie-Louise, a reliquary brooch and diadem from Empress Eugénie, and other royal jewelry linked to the Orléans and French royal families. The stolen items were crafted by 19th-century Parisian jewelers and represent centuries of French imperial history and cultural pride. One of the stolen items, Eugénie’s crown, was recovered near the scene but was damaged. Art expert Arthur Brand described the theft as a 'national disaster' for France, warning that the thieves will likely dismantle and sell the jewels, melting the gold and silver. The Louvre, which acquired many of these items in the 2000s, has lost irreplaceable pieces of national heritage. The heist underscores the vulnerability of cultural institutions and the global significance of preserving historical artifacts.",
