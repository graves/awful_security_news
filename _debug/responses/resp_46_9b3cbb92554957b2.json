  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article exposes the exploitation of workers in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where women face long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats to their safety. Despite the sector’s economic importance—accounting for nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP—workers have little protection due to weak labor enforcement, lack of union representation, and suppression of dissent. Korean companies dominate the industry, sourcing garments for major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, without legal responsibility for labor conditions. Workers are often denied pensions, severance, and fair treatment, with union leaders facing violence, including the murder of one, and labor inspectors blocked from entering factories. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has introduced wage increases and reforms, but systemic corruption and power imbalances continue. The article highlights how US nearshoring policies and global supply chain dynamics have enabled this exploitation, while also raising urgent concerns about gender, power, and accountability in global fashion trade.",
