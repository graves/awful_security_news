He fled to Scotland, where he was arrested while receiving treatment for COVID-19 after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos, including one from Brown University. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 and convicted in a second rape case in September 2025. The case highlights the dangers of false death claims by sex offenders and the importance of DNA databases and international cooperation in solving cold cases. Rossi, who used aliases like Arthur Knight, is considered a flight risk and a serial abuser, and the sentencing underscores the need for accountability and public safety.",
