  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza, following a ceasefire that has been strained by the slow return of remaining bodies. Hamas handed over the bodies of Oakkharasri and Israeli citizen Ronen Engel, who was killed in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, for formal identification. The return of 12 out of 28 bodies has raised concerns over the fate of the remaining hostages, with Israel accusing Hamas of withholding bodies and using them as leverage. The ceasefire is under pressure due to delayed aid access, Israeli military strikes, and the closure of the Rafah crossing, which is vital for humanitarian aid. Protests in Israel, U.S. warnings of an imminent Hamas violation, and public demands for full compliance with the agreement highlight the urgency and complexity of achieving a sustainable peace. The war is said to end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed, according to Israeli leadership.",
