  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A recent social media post by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security calling on immigrants to 'remigrate' to their home countries has sparked widespread backlash and raised serious concerns about the historical and ideological connotations of the term. Experts point out that 'remigration' has roots in Nazi antisemitic policies, such as the Madagascar Plan, and is now used by far-right groups as a tool to justify ethnic cleansing under the guise of 'remigration' or 'deportation'. The Great Replacement Theory, a racist conspiracy claiming that non-white populations are being replaced by immigrants, has inspired violent attacks in Europe and the U.S., including in Norway, Christchurch, El Paso, and Buffalo. In Italy, under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, remigration policies have been implemented through the deportation of asylum-seekers to Albania and by targeting families based on national origin—even if they were born in Italy. Legal challenges, including a 2025 ruling by the European Court of Justice, have criticized such practices for violating humanitarian and asylum laws. Experts warn that the use of the term 'remigrate' acts as a 'dog whistle' for extremist ideologies, and that its vague and ambiguous nature allows far-right groups to interpret it in ways that promote racial purity and ethnic homogeneity, thereby legitimizing dangerous and discriminatory policies.",
