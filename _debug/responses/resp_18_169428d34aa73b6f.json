  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America—primarily driven by Generation Z—have resulted in political upheavals, including the removal of Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina in 2025. The protests were organized through social media and stemmed from widespread dissatisfaction with governance, corruption, and economic inequality. While Madagascar’s youth succeeded in removing Rajoelina, the military now holds power under Michael Randrianirina, indicating that political change may not always be democratic. Similar movements have occurred in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Kenya, showing a growing trend of young people asserting political power. The article warns that African leaders should be wary, as the continent’s youth, especially in the face of high unemployment and poor public services, are increasingly organized and vocal. Even long-standing regimes in Uganda and Kenya have faced youth-led challenges, and movements in Morocco (GenZ 212) suggest regional spread. Experts believe that the success in Madagascar could inspire renewed activism in other countries, making youth-led political change a potential regular feature of African politics.",
