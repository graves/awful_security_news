  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture—part of a broader set of trade policies under President Donald Trump—are increasing construction and renovation costs, pushing the already struggling housing market further into financial difficulty. These tariffs, which took effect in late October 2025, have already caused budget overruns for homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera in New Jersey, with some businesses like RH and IKEA facing significant financial losses or price hikes. Economists, including Peter Harrell and Matthew Walsh, warn that cost uncertainty and inflation will be passed on to consumers, with up to 55% of tariff costs borne by households. Even domestic firms like Stillfried Design and Colony are affected due to rising input prices. While homebuilders do not see a complete collapse, the cumulative effect of multiple tariffs—including previous levies on steel and copper—exacerbates affordability issues, especially in affordable housing. Experts caution that the situation may worsen in January, as further tariff increases are expected.",
