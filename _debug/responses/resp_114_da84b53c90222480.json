    "Kenny Loggins has publicly objected to the use of his song 'Danger Zone' in an AI-generated video posted by President Trump, demanding its removal.",
    "The video features a fictional, crown-wearing Trump in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' playing 'Danger Zone' while dropping sludge over protest crowds, resembling a scene from the movie Top Gun.",
    "The video was posted on Truth Social as a response to the widespread 'No Kings' protests across the U.S. on Saturday, October 19, 2025.",
    "Loggins emphasized that the use of his music in a politically charged, divisive context is inappropriate and that music should be used to unite rather than divide.",
    "Although the use of music in political videos is generally legal under copyright law—except in campaign ads—many artists choose to publicly oppose such uses to highlight ethical concerns.",
    "The White House has not responded directly to Loggins' request, and no official action has been taken to remove the video or the music from the platform.",
    "Other artists, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, have previously sued Trump over copyright infringement, though the White Stripes dropped their suit in November 2024 and the Hayes case is still ongoing."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has formally objected to the use of his song 'Danger Zone' in an AI-generated video posted by former President Donald Trump on Truth Social. The video, which depicts a fictional 'KING TRUMP' in a fighter jet playing 'Danger Zone' while dumping sludge over protest crowds, was created as a response to the 'No Kings' protests across the U.S. Loggins claims the use of his performance is unauthorized and inappropriate, especially given its divisive political context. While such uses are generally legal under copyright law, artists often publicly oppose them to express ethical concerns about the misuse of cultural content. The White House has not responded to the request, and other artists, including The White Stripes and Isaac Hayes' estate, have previously filed lawsuits over similar issues, though some have been dropped or remain in court.",
