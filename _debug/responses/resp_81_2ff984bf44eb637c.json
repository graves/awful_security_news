  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the death of inmate Robert Brooks, who was beaten three times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024. The body-camera footage, which showed guards punching, stomping, and lifting Brooks by the neck without sound, played a central role in the trial. Two other guards, Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of murder charges, despite being charged with manslaughter and gang assault. The prosecution argued that all guards acted as a gang with 'depraved indifference to human life.' The case is part of a broader pattern of inmate violence, as similar fatal incidents have occurred at nearby Mid-State Correctional Facility involving Messiah Nantwi. District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, who took over the case due to Attorney General Letitia James's recusal, is prosecuting both cases, highlighting systemic concerns about prison guard conduct and oversight.",
