  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has been formally asked to stop using his royal titles following revelations that he maintained contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after claiming he had severed ties in 2010. Emails from February 2011 show Andrew wrote to Epstein saying they were 'in this together,' contradicting earlier statements. The move, announced by Buckingham Palace, comes amid growing public scrutiny and the release of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which alleges that Andrew treated sex trafficking as a normalized experience. The royal family, especially Prince Charles and Prince William, has sought to insulate the monarchy from ongoing scandals, particularly during a sensitive state visit to the Vatican. While Andrew retains his titles technically, his renunciation of their use marks a significant institutional distancing, with experts noting that such a move reflects public demand for accountability, transparency, and reform within the monarchy.",
