  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The widespread popularity of cowboy imagery in modern American culture — seen in fashion, media, and political discourse — reflects a deep-seated cultural myth that ties the cowboy to American values like patriotism, individualism, and rugged self-reliance. While rooted in early 19th-century Western entertainment and romanticized portrayals from films and shows, the current surge is heavily influenced by political conservatism, especially during the Trump administration, where cowboy symbolism is used to promote individualism and anti-establishment values. Brands from Sweetgreen to Canada Goose have capitalized on the trend, while TV dramas like 'Yellowstone' and '1923' keep Western narratives in the public eye. However, this image is historically inaccurate: real cowboys were primarily Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans, and their contributions have long been erased from mainstream narratives. Recent efforts by artists like Gabriela Hasbun and cultural figures like Beyoncé have begun to correct this imbalance by spotlighting Black rodeo culture. Despite this progress, the dominant media and political portrayal of the cowboy remains a sanitized, whitewashed version, reflecting a cyclical pattern of myth-making and rebranding that continues to shape American identity.",
