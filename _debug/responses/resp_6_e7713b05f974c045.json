    "Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 2025 oversight visit at an ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey.",
    "McIver’s defense claims the charges are politically motivated, citing a partisan backlash against her and the broader 'wokeness' agenda of the Trump administration, and that her actions were part of official legislative duties protected under the Speech or Debate Clause.",
    "Prosecutors allege that McIver physically confronted ICE agents by slamming her forearm into one and using her forearms to strike another during a brief scuffle, which occurred during a congressional oversight inspection.",
    "Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government officials’ social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa was involved are prejudicial and ordered removal from public platforms, citing concerns about jury taint.",
    "DHS press releases and certain social media posts were removed, but one X post still remains suggesting members of Congress 'stormed' the facility gate.",
    "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was forcibly removed from the facility and later arrested for trespassing, a charge that was dropped.",
    "Other Democratic lawmakers present during the incident were not charged, leading to criticism from McIver’s attorneys about selective prosecution and lack of consistency in enforcement.",
    "McIver’s legal team argues that the Trump administration has shown bias by not pardoning individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot, contrasting it with her prosecution.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to challenge a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a May 9, 2025, congressional oversight visit to a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. Prosecutors claim she physically confronted agents by slapping and grabbing them, while her defense argues her actions were part of official legislative duties protected by the Speech or Debate Clause and that the case is politically motivated, part of a broader effort to target Democratic voices critical of the Trump administration. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government officials' social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa was involved are prejudicial and ordered their removal, citing jury contamination risks. Other Democratic lawmakers present during the incident were not charged, raising concerns about selective prosecution. McIver’s attorneys claim the case is retaliatory and contrasts with Trump’s leniency toward January 6 rioters. President Donald Trump has criticized McIver, calling the 'days of woke over,' intensifying the political controversy. Supporters, including Reps. Menendez, Watson Coleman, Omar, Crockett, and Jacobs, rallied behind her, emphasizing accountability and resistance to political persecution.",
