  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six universities, including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and MIT, have rejected a White House funding proposal that would offer preferential access to federal grants in exchange for significant ideological and policy changes. The compact demands the removal of sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, enforcing 'grade integrity,' and requiring annual anonymous polling of faculty and staff to assess compliance. Universities argue that such demands compromise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House cast the initiative as a way to improve higher education through ideological alignment, but critics, including university leaders and advocates for academic independence, view it as an overreach that undermines the sovereignty of academic institutions. While several schools are still reviewing the proposal, the rejections signal a strong resistance across the higher education landscape to federal control over academic governance.",
