    "The 2013 study analyzed circumcision rates and autism rates across nine countries but did not assess acetaminophen use and explicitly stated that correlation does not imply causation and that the findings were exploratory and hypothesis-generating.",
    "The 2015 Danish study found a modestly increased risk of autism in circumcised boys, but the sample size was extremely small (only 57 boys had both circumcision and autism), and it did not examine acetaminophen use.",
    "Neither study provides evidence that circumcision or acetaminophen causes autism. Experts emphasize that decades of research show acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately under medical supervision.",
    "The 2025 WPLab preprint, which Kennedy referenced, has not been peer-reviewed and is considered unreliable; it claims 'overwhelming evidence' that acetaminophen triggers autism, a claim not supported by scientific consensus.",
    "WPLab, a North Carolina-based company, has been linked to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. through personal and professional contacts, and its publications promote a causative link between acetaminophen and autism without rigorous scientific validation.",
    "Mainstream experts and researchers, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, stress that correlation does not equal causation and that confounding variables like cultural, demographic, and religious factors are not accounted for in the studies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made claims in October 2025 linking autism to circumcision and acetaminophen, citing two studies — a 2013 cross-national analysis and a 2015 Danish study — that show only weak correlations. However, experts refute these claims: neither study proves causation, both have significant limitations (such as small sample sizes and lack of acetaminophen data), and the 2025 WPLab preprint cited by Kennedy has not been peer-reviewed and promotes a causative link not supported by science. The studies are described as exploratory, with authors warning against drawing causal conclusions. Decades of research confirm acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately. The article highlights concerns about misinformation, especially given the personal connection between Kennedy and WPLab CEO William Parker, and underscores that correlation does not imply causation.",
