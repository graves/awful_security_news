  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December 2023 after pleading guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges in August 2024. Santos had been serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, and was reportedly held in solitary confinement for extended periods. Trump justified the commutation by citing mistreatment and calling Santos a 'rogue' who does not deserve harsh punishment. Santos himself had previously claimed he was denied a pardon, and now appeals for 'fairness' and a chance to rebuild. The move drew strong support from Republican lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Anna Paulina Luna, who praised the commutation as a correction of injustice. However, it drew criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who argued that Trump should have addressed the ongoing government healthcare crisis instead. The event underscores the intersection of political power, justice, and public perception in high-profile cases of congressional misconduct.",
