  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to build a $250 million ballroom in the White House's East Wing, marking the first major structural change to the complex since 1948. The project, which began in October 2025, involves reconstructing the two-story East Wing—historically used by the first lady and for diplomatic visits—despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a government shutdown. The new ballroom, estimated at 90,000 square feet and capable of seating up to 999 people, will be designed by McCrery Architects and constructed by Clark Construction with engineering support from AECOM. Trump claims the project will not affect the main White House building and will be funded privately, with no cost to taxpayers. The work is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s term in January 2029, during which time offices will be relocated. This initiative reflects both a desire to modernize presidential event spaces and broader political symbolism, as Trump positions himself as the first president to fulfill a long-held dream of a White House ballroom.",
