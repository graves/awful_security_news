  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States President Donald Trump has urged Russia and Ukraine to immediately halt hostilities and freeze the war along current battle lines, particularly in the Donbas region, where Russia holds about 78% of the land. He proposes leaving the territorial divisions as they are, with future negotiations on details. This marks a significant departure from previous U.S. policy under President Joe Biden, which included strong military and financial support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized Putin as being more powerful than Hamas and has emphasized the potential of the Gaza ceasefire as a model for peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy also requested long-range Tomahawk missiles, which Trump has not committed to providing, citing national security concerns. Trump is set to meet with Putin in Hungary, suggesting a direct diplomatic path toward a ceasefire, though the proposal faces resistance from Ukraine’s leadership over territorial integrity.",
