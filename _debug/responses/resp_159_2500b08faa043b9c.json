  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In an oil tanker explosion in Niger state, Nigeria, on 2025-10-22, dozens of villagers died after collecting spilled fuel from a tanker that had crashed due to poor road conditions on the Bida-Agaie road near Essan and Badeggi. The incident, which resulted in at least 29 to 35 deaths and over 40 injuries, reflects a recurring pattern of tragedies in Nigeria, including a 2024 explosion in Jigawa state that killed 153 and a 2025 incident in Suleja that killed 86. Despite repeated awareness campaigns, villagers continue to collect fuel from overturned tankers, a dangerous practice highlighted by state officials. The Nigerian government agencies, including the Federal Road Safety Corps and National Emergency Management Agency, reported conflicting casualty figures, indicating challenges in accurate reporting. The disaster underscores systemic issues such as poor road infrastructure, inadequate public awareness, and the high risk of fuel-related accidents in Nigeria’s oil transport network.",
