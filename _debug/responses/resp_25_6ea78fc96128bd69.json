  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a congressional oversight visit at a facility in Newark, New Jersey in May 2025. Prosecutors claim she physically attacked agents by grabbing and striking them, while McIver’s attorneys argue her actions were part of legitimate legislative oversight protected under the Speech or Debate Clause. The case has drawn political attention, with President Donald Trump criticizing her prosecution as part of a broader anti-'wokeness' agenda. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that the incident involved Antifa activity are prejudicial and ordered DHS to remove such content. Despite the removal of some official statements, a DHS X post still claims members of Congress 'stormed' the facility. Other Democratic lawmakers have publicly supported McIver, and the case is scheduled to go to trial on November 10, 2025. The incident also involved Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was removed from the facility and arrested on trespassing charges, which were later dropped.",
