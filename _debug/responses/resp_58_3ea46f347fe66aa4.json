Diplomatic efforts led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have intensified, with high-level meetings held with Israeli military leaders to strengthen compliance. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has expressed deep condolences to Haimi’s family, emphasizing the emotional toll of the prolonged uncertainty. The article underscores the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the immense humanitarian, political, and diplomatic stakes involved in the return of deceased hostages.",
