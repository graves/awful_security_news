  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks, including multiple blasts near Khartoum international airport on 2025-10-21, have disrupted efforts to reopen the airport just one day before its scheduled reopening after over two years of closure. The attacks, reportedly using 'suicide drones' and blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), mark the third such incident in seven days. While Sudan’s military intercepted some drones, no group has claimed responsibility, and details on casualties or damage remain unclear. The RSF has continued targeting military and civilian infrastructure, including army bases and Omdurman, raising concerns about ongoing instability. Since the army’s recapture of Khartoum in early 2025, over 800,000 people have returned, and reconstruction efforts have begun. However, widespread destruction and blackouts persist. The broader conflict, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million, continues to threaten regional stability, with the RSF surrounding el-Fasher in Darfur and prompting UN warnings of potential ethnic violence.",
