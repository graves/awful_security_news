  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Louvre Museum heist, in which thieves used industrial tools to steal nine Napoleonic jewels from the Apollo Gallery during regular museum hours, signals a significant shift in museum crime. Historically, museum robberies have targeted high-value art for cultural or sentimental reasons, but recent heists — such as the 2019 Green Vault robbery in Dresden and the 2025 Paris attacks — show a growing trend toward stealing raw materials like diamonds and gold for immediate resale. Experts, including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath, describe this as a form of 'cultural terrorism' driven by economic gain, not cultural appreciation. The heist involved sophisticated planning, including the use of angle grinders, a blowtorch, and a stolen crown of Empress Eugénie, and raises serious concerns about museum security in open, public settings. The frequency and similarity of recent thefts — including at the Natural History Museum and Limoges Museum — suggest possible links to organized crime, such as the German Remmo clan. French authorities and Interpol are now investigating, with the stolen items added to international databases. The incident underscores a deep national loss of cultural heritage and calls into question the adequacy of current museum security measures.",
