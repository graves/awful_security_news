  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv suffered a total blackout following a 'massive' assault involving over 100 Iranian-made Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles. The attack, which killed four people and injured ten others—including a 10-year-old girl—in nearby Novhorod-Siverskyi, targeted civilian infrastructure such as power and water systems. Ukrainian officials, including deputy regional military administrator Andriy Podorvan, report a significant increase in such attacks over the past months, with Russia increasingly targeting non-military facilities like petrol stations. This suggests a strategic shift toward psychological warfare aimed at undermining civilian morale. Despite the devastation, residents in Chernihiv remain resilient, with many continuing daily routines and supporting each other. The broader implications include severe economic damage—estimated at over $16 billion—and the strain on Ukraine’s energy resilience, especially as winter approaches. International cooperation, including diplomatic talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US energy leaders, is now vital to restore and modernize Ukraine’s energy systems.",
