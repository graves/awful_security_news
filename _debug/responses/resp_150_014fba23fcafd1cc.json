  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Since the fragile ceasefire brokered by the United States in September 2025, with mediation from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, has been repeatedly violated, Israel has conducted numerous airstrikes and military operations in Gaza, killing nearly 100 Palestinians and wounding over 230. Despite Hamas claiming it had no fighters in Rafah and denying any attacks, Israel alleges Hamas violated the agreement by targeting soldiers in Rafah, leading to further strikes. Hamas asserts it has recovered 12 of the 28 captives' bodies, citing the immense destruction of infrastructure and lack of excavation equipment. Israel has also restricted humanitarian aid by closing the Rafah crossing and limiting aid trucks to 300 — half of the agreed number. The 'invisible yellow line' divides Gaza, creating fear among civilians who cannot determine if their homes lie within Israeli or Palestinian territory. The ceasefire remains under dispute, with the U.S. maintaining it is still in effect, but international bodies and the UN have labeled Israel’s actions as potentially constituting genocide. The situation underscores the fragility of peace efforts and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
