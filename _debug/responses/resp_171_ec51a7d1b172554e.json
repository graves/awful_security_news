  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, involving four masked thieves who broke into the Apollo Gallery using a crane and stole eight royal jewels—including items from Queen Marie-Amélie, Queen Hortense, and Empress Eugenie—has been estimated to be worth $102 million. The theft, which took just seven minutes, has sparked national outrage over longstanding security failures, with the French Court of Auditors noting that only a fraction of the museum was under surveillance since 2019. Director Laurence des Cars had previously raised alarms about deteriorating security, and the incident has intensified pressure on the French government to address museum safety. The heist follows similar crimes at other Paris museums, such as the Natural History Museum and Limoges Museum, indicating a broader national crisis in cultural heritage protection. Authorities have detained a 24-year-old Chinese woman in connection with the Natural History Museum theft, while security staff reductions and rising visitor numbers raise concerns about institutional neglect. The Louvre, one of the world’s most visited museums, continues to face mounting scrutiny over both its financial management and public safety.",
