  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is engaging in aggressive, politically risky foreign policy actions toward Venezuela, including military buildups by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, and authorizing covert CIA operations targeting drug trafficking and possibly regime change. These actions have sparked internal tensions, such as the sudden retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, who oversees U.S. Southern Command. The article highlights that such interventions are politically dangerous, as public opinion in the U.S. is deeply skeptical of foreign military action—especially regime change—despite some support for combating drug trafficking in specific contexts. The broader context suggests that Trump’s actions represent a shift toward militarism in foreign policy, and if pursued, could lead to significant political backlash due to lack of public support.",
