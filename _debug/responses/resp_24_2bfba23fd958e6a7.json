  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that affirmed the president’s authority to deploy the Guard in response to violent resistance against immigration enforcement, as seen in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that the decision is unreviewable or at least entitled to extreme judicial deference, relying on the 1827 precedent of Martin v. Mott, which grants the president sole authority over declaring emergencies. However, Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit have challenged the deployment, asserting that protests are not equivalent to riots and that local law enforcement has adequately managed the situation. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision within days, which could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the country in response to domestic protests.",
