  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s climate-vulnerable regions—particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—Indigenous knowledge systems are proving more effective than government-installed early warning systems in preventing loss of life during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite a $37 million GLOF-II project and real-time monitoring systems, communities lack trust due to frequent failures, poor communication, and lack of community involvement. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain use traditional methods—such as gunfire signals, animal behavior, and weather patterns—to detect and warn of floods, saving lives when technology fails. The article highlights that Pakistan, though a low-emitter nation, faces extreme climate risks, with rising temperatures and glacier melt accelerating disasters. It concludes that while technological systems are critical, they must be integrated with local knowledge and community trust to be effective, suggesting a shift toward hybrid, culturally grounded disaster response models.",
