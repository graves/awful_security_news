  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, following a critical analysis in her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines'. In the book, she argues that Democratic disunity, public expressions of doubt from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney, and a failure to anticipate future conservative agendas like Project 2025 and anti-DEI policies, contributed to the party's defeat in the 2024 election. Jean-Pierre recounts her observations during the June 2024 debate, where she first noticed signs of President Biden’s health, which she believes were exploited by political opponents. She also discusses the systemic bias she faced as a Black woman in a prominent political role and the crucial loyalty of Black women and marginalized communities, which she says were overlooked. Her decision to identify as an independent is not a political defection but a call for accountability, transparency, and political reimagining — urging Americans to reject silence and engage in a more inclusive, honest, and responsive democracy.",
