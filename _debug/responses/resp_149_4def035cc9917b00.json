  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes ahead of Tropical Storm Fengshen, which is expected to pass near the island with strong winds and a moderate risk of coastal flooding from 1.2-meter waves. This evacuation is part of a recurring drill, as Catanduanes is often the first landmass affected by cyclones from the western Pacific. The Philippines, already reeling from a series of earthquakes and typhoons in recent weeks, faces heightened climate-related risks due to global warming, with scientists warning of increasingly powerful storms. The storm comes amid a pattern of disaster events, including Typhoon Ragasa and major earthquakes in Cebu and southern regions, illustrating the country's ongoing struggle with natural hazards and disaster recovery.",
