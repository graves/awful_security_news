  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated due to warnings of coastal flooding and high winds. The storm is expected to pass near the island with gusts up to 80km/h and waves up to 1.2 meters. This evacuation is part of a recurring pattern, as Catanduanes has historically been one of the first areas hit by cyclones in the western Pacific. The Philippines faces an average of 20 storms annually, and scientists link increasing storm intensity to climate change. The current crisis occurs amid a broader context of recent disasters, including deadly earthquakes in Cebu and the southern Philippines, and the previous impact of Typhoon Ragasa, showing the country's persistent vulnerability to extreme weather and seismic events.",
