  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—passed down through generations—is proving more effective than government-installed technological early warning systems in preventing loss of life during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite a $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017, many systems remain non-operational or untrusted due to poor community engagement, lack of maintenance, and failure to deliver real-time alerts. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on traditional signs—such as sudden rainfall, animal behavior, and sound patterns—to detect floods and alert villagers. In one instance, a shepherd fired a gun as a pre-agreed signal, triggering a rapid evacuation that saved over 300 lives. Pakistan, one of the most climate-vulnerable countries despite low emissions, faces increasing GLOF risks due to warming temperatures and reduced snowfall. Experts stress that trust in systems and community participation are essential for resilience, and while technology is necessary, it must be complemented by culturally rooted, locally trusted knowledge systems.",
