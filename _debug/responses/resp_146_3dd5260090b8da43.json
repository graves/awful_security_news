  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was already approved in April by 63 members, but the delay stems from Trump’s intervention, including threats of visa restrictions and port levies. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain remained committed, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted to opposition or postponement. The decision undermines global efforts to reduce shipping emissions, which contribute significantly to climate change, with impacts such as more frequent storms and altered ocean currents. Industry leaders and climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s climate minister and the International Chamber of Shipping, expressed disappointment over the lack of clarity needed for investment in clean technologies like ammonia or methanol fuels.",
