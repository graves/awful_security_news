He is expected to be held in the prison’s VIP wing, historically reserved for high-risk or politically sensitive inmates such as Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. The case is a landmark in political accountability, and Sarkozy’s legal team has requested early release, with a two-month window for the court to decide.",
