  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—has significantly increased the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% year-over-year rise in U.S. retail coffee prices. With Brazil being the largest supplier (30.7% of imports), the 50% tariff has had the most profound impact, especially amid a drought reducing supply. Multiple coffee roasters in the U.S., including Swing’s, Vigilante, and Celtic Cup, report higher bean and beverage costs, which are passed on to consumers. Despite economic pressure, consumers continue to view coffee as an affordable luxury, and small businesses face uncertainty in pricing and long-term viability. In response, a bipartisan group of legislators, including Reps. Don Bacon and Ro Khanna, introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' in September 2025 to exempt coffee from tariffs, aiming to stabilize prices and protect consumers and small roasters.",
