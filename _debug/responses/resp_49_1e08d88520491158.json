  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The ongoing government shutdown has led to the furlough of 9,000 National Park Service employees, disrupting operations at national parks such as Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and those in West Virginia. While some tourists remain undeterred, advocates and local businesses warn of serious safety risks including illegal activities like drone use and base jumping, increased vandalism, and trash buildup. The absence of rangers and staff undermines emergency response, law enforcement, and visitor guidance. In Washington, D.C., closure of the Smithsonian museums has led to a surge in visitors to private museums and historic sites like Mount Vernon. Meanwhile, local businesses—especially in rural areas—report mixed economic impacts, with some experiencing revenue drops. Advocacy groups are urging park closures to protect safety and preserve park integrity. The article underscores a growing concern about the long-term economic and environmental consequences of prolonged federal shutdowns on national parks and surrounding communities.",
