  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government is in an extended shutdown, entering its fourth week and affecting over 2.4 million federal workers, with many facing missed paychecks. Critical federal programs such as Head Start and WIC are at risk of funding cuts. The National Nuclear Security Administration has furloughed 1,400 employees, and the FAA is reporting flight delays. President Donald Trump is hosting a meeting with Republican senators, but has firmly rejected compromise on health care subsidies, which expire on December 31. Democrats argue that the shutdown is worsening economic and social harm, particularly for low-income families, and maintain that the crisis must be resolved before the next ACA enrollment period begins. Economists warn of ongoing economic damage, with weekly losses estimated at 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of GDP. Despite pressure, no agreement has been reached, and political stalemate continues.",
