  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Repair work has begun at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of Europe’s largest, following a four-week outage caused by attacks that severed its external power lines. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), led by Director General Rafael Grossi, has confirmed that the work is being carried out under ceasefire zones established between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The repairs are being conducted in two phases: first, a 1.5km ceasefire zone is set to allow restoration of the Dniprovska 750-kilovolt line under Russian control; second, a separate ceasefire zone will enable repair of the Ferosplavna-1 330-kilovolt backup line in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The plant, currently relying on diesel generators since September 2025, faces a serious risk of meltdown or radiation release if power is not restored. The IAEA emphasizes that off-site power is essential for reactor cooling and nuclear safety. Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately severing the power line, while Russia denies intent to restart the plant. Diplomatic coordination between Kyiv, Moscow, and the IAEA has been critical, including meetings involving Grossi, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev. The situation highlights the intersection of nuclear safety, geopolitical conflict, and international diplomacy.",
