  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be sourcing beef from illegal cattle ranches operating within protected areas of the Brazilian Amazon, particularly in Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: it does not track its indirect cattle suppliers, allowing cattle raised on illegally deforested land to be 'laundered' through transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual animal tracking. This system enables deforestation, land grabs, and human rights abuses, including threats and violence against Indigenous and traditional communities. Despite past promises to improve traceability, JBS has failed to meet commitments made in 2009. The article underscores the urgent need for stronger, mandatory government-led traceability systems, with calls for greater transparency, public access to GTA data, and enforcement of environmental regulations—especially as the world prepares for the COP30 climate summit in Pará.",
