  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. The prizes, established by Alfred Nobel’s will, are awarded by specialized institutions and represent the world’s highest recognition of scientific, literary, and humanitarian achievements. While the science prizes emphasize long-term impact and discovery, the peace prize remains responsive to global conflicts and political narratives. This year, controversy arises from U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the peace prize, with experts noting the committee’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts, not individual self-promotion. Concerns have also been raised about political interference in science, particularly from the Trump administration, which threatens academic freedom. The article highlights both the scientific breakthroughs and the political dimensions of the Nobel Prizes, underscoring their global significance and the balance between scientific merit and public discourse.",
