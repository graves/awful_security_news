  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court seeking authorization to deploy National Guard troops to Illinois, following a lower court denial of the deployment. The administration argues that federal agents face 'ongoing and intolerable risks' to their safety, particularly in the Chicago area, and claims it has the authority to intervene to protect federal facilities and personnel. However, multiple state officials—including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California’s Governor Gavin Newsom—have opposed such actions, arguing that the president overstepped his constitutional authority and failed to consult with state leaders. Legal challenges have emerged in cities including Portland, Memphis, and Los Angeles, where courts have blocked troop deployments or cited violations of state sovereignty. The Supreme Court has now asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the appeal by Monday evening. This development marks a significant moment in the ongoing constitutional debate over executive power, federal intervention in local affairs, and the role of military forces in domestic unrest.",
