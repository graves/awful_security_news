  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A classified defense satellite network called Starshield, built by SpaceX and operated by the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), is transmitting downlink signals in the 2025–2110 MHz frequency band — a range normally reserved for Earth-to-satellite uplink commands. This action violates International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards and could interfere with other satellites' operations. The signals were first detected by amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley, who noticed an unexpected transmission while scanning radio frequencies. Experts like Kevin Gifford suggest the use of these frequencies may be intended to conceal operations or take advantage of a quiet spectrum, though it remains unclear whether the interference is currently disruptive. Since May 2024, the NRO has launched 11 Starshield satellites, with over 170 detected so far. SpaceX and the NRO have not responded to public inquiries, and the global satellite community is now concerned about potential disruptions to critical space-based communications and operations.",
