  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City Democratic primary marks a historic breakthrough for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), representing the largest electoral achievement in the party’s history. The DSA has experienced a surge in membership, reaching 80,000 nationally and 11,000 in New York City, with members increasingly embracing socialist policies such as rent control, universal childcare, and single-payer healthcare. This rise is tied to broader public disillusionment with the Democratic Party establishment, especially after Trump’s election and the failure to address economic inequality and systemic injustice. The DSA’s strong support for Palestinian liberation and its critique of capitalism have become central to its identity, though internal tensions—such as the censure of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—highlight ideological fractures. Despite these challenges, progressive candidates like Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson are adopting DSA-style grassroots mobilization, signaling a broader shift in American political culture where voters demand more radical, action-oriented leadership beyond traditional party lines.",
