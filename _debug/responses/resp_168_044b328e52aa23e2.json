  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI-powered scam targeted Italian businessmen in early 2025, using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request a $1 million euro transfer. The fraud, which occurred just after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, was uncovered when Crosetto realized he had been falsely called by a 'friend' and a 'General' claiming to be from his office. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants mistaking 58% of clones for real voices and rating them as more trustworthy. The global financial losses from deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025, with increasing use in identity theft and the creation of illegal sexual content involving real people. In response, the U.S. and Australia have introduced laws criminalizing the publication of AI-generated intimate images, underscoring the growing societal and legal urgency to regulate this rapidly advancing technology.",
