  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically short, with only 750 metric tonnes of food entering daily — far below the 2,000-tonne target — due to just two operational border crossings: Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite an increase from five to 26 distribution points, access remains severely limited, especially in the north, where the Salah al-Din Street has not been opened. The Rafah crossing with Egypt remains closed, pending Hamas’ return of the remains of deceased captives. The US-brokered ceasefire, supported by President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan, is seen as essential to sustaining humanitarian access, but current conditions indicate a dire lack of aid and ongoing uncertainty about the ceasefire’s future. Palestinians are rationing food and storing supplies due to fears of renewed conflict.",
