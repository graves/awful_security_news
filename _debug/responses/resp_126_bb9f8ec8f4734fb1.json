  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early peanut exposure in infants could reduce the risk of life-threatening allergies, new research shows that implementing early allergen introduction guidelines — first issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017 — has led to a significant decline in peanut allergies in U.S. children. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, found that peanut allergy rates dropped by over 27% and more than 40% after the guidance was introduced. Approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015, including 29% of children who would have otherwise developed allergies. The findings support updated 2021 guidance recommending that infants be introduced to allergenic foods like peanut butter and soy-based yogurt between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior screening. Advocacy from groups like FARE and real-world adoption by healthcare providers suggest that early allergen introduction is becoming a widely accepted and effective public health strategy.",
