  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Myanmar military has raided KK Park, one of the most notorious online scam hubs on the Thai-Myanmar border, claiming to have dismantled a center linked to fraud, human trafficking, and ties to Chinese criminal figures like Wan Kuok Koi (Broken Tooth). The operation, part of a larger effort to regain control of key territory—especially around the trade town of Myawaddy—for a planned December 2025 election, also involved the seizure of 30 Starlink terminals used by scammers. However, experts believe the raid may have targeted Chinese interests, with Beijing allegedly providing lists of individuals to be deported from the complex. Despite this, at least 30 similar scam compounds remain operational, protected by junta-aligned militia groups, indicating that the problem is systemic and deeply entrenched in the region’s conflict and economy.",
