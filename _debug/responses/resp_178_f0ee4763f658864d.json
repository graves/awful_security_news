  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew's ability to afford his 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor is explained by a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate, in which he paid a total of approximately £8 million in upfront payments—covering renovations and the buyout of future rent obligations—effectively eliminating annual rent. Despite the property being a symbol of royal privilege, the arrangement has come under scrutiny due to ongoing allegations of misconduct involving Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, sparking public and political debate over whether royal members should pay their fair share and live privately. The lease requires Prince Andrew to maintain the property and includes clauses on upkeep, no helicopters, and no gambling, while allowing his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie to inherit the lease upon his departure. Financial details, including an initial £5 million for repairs and £2.5 million for rent buyout, were confirmed by the National Audit Office, which found the arrangement to be 'value for money.' However, questions remain about the source of the funds and whether such arrangements represent a fair use of public funds, especially in light of the controversies surrounding Prince Andrew’s personal life and conduct.",
