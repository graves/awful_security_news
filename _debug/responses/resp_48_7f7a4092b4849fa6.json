  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) that would link its use during pregnancy to increased risks of autism or ADHD in children. The proposal stems from public statements by former President Donald Trump, who claimed without evidence that Tylenol use increases autism risk, and advocacy by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Informed Consent Action Network, which filed a citizen petition with the FDA. However, major scientific studies—such as one involving over 2 million children and a meta-analysis of 46 studies—have found no clear causal link between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA maintains that no such evidence exists and has not updated its official position. Meanwhile, regulatory bodies in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada have affirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. The controversy underscores the tension between political messaging and scientific evidence in public health policy.",
