  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America—primarily driven by Gen Z activists born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s—has led to significant political changes. In Madagascar, protests forced the removal of President Andry Rajoelina, who was succeeded by military leader Michael Randrianirina. The movement was amplified by social media and involved a convergence of youth activism and military intervention. Similar movements have occurred in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, where youth protests led to the ousting of long-standing leaders. Experts warn that African leaders should be cautious, as youth frustration over corruption, unemployment, and poor governance is growing. Countries like Kenya and Uganda are experiencing protests, with leaders responding with resistance, arrests, and political threats. While some movements have stalled or been suppressed, Madagascar's success may inspire renewed activism across the continent, suggesting that youth-led political upheaval could become a regular feature of African politics in the future.",
