  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A trade dispute between the United States and China over the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia — a key supplier of automotive chips — threatens to halt global car production and drive up car prices. The conflict began when the U.S. Commerce Department restricted Wingtech Technologies, Nexperia’s parent company, in December 2024, and escalated when China banned Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting components in October 2025. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia in response. Since automotive vehicles rely heavily on chips for functions like fuel delivery and braking, the shortage could lead to widespread plant shutdowns, with supply lasting only weeks and recovery taking months. Automakers, including major U.S. and European firms, warn that without swift international action, the crisis could disrupt global auto supply chains and push prices even higher, especially as tariffs and supply vulnerabilities have already contributed to record car prices.",
