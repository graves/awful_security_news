  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has officially identified the remains of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli military official killed on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack on a kibbutz. He is the 13th deceased Israeli hostage identified since the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal was signed on October 9, 2025. The identification comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to enforce the agreement, which requires Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours. However, Israeli intelligence believes Hamas may not be able to locate or recover all bodies due to extensive war damage in Gaza. One of the bodies previously handed over was not Israeli, indicating possible misidentification. The US has intensified pressure on Hamas, with President Donald Trump threatening to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the ceasefire. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with senior Israeli military leaders to discuss implementation and compliance. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed deep condolences to Haimi’s family, recognizing both the grief and the solace of a long-awaited return. This development reflects the fragile state of the ceasefire and the continued struggle to deliver on its most sensitive and emotionally charged commitments.",
