  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man from Rhode Island with the legal name Nicholas Alahverdian, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. After being identified through a DNA match from a decade-old rape kit, he allegedly faked his death in 2020 and fled the U.S., using multiple aliases including Arthur Knight. He was arrested in Scotland in 2024 after being recognized by hospital staff through his distinctive tattoos, including a Brown University crest. After a protracted extradition process, he was returned to Utah and sentenced in October 2025 to a prison term of five years to life for a first-degree rape felony. The victim described the trauma of the assault and emphasized a plea for safety and accountability. Prosecutors argued he was a dangerous flight risk, while Rossi maintained his innocence and claimed the victims were lying. The case highlights challenges in solving rape cases with backlogs, the use of international law enforcement cooperation, and the dangers of predatory behavior masked by online dating.",
