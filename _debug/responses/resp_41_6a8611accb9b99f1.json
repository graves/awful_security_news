  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers at VA facilities across the U.S. are raising serious concerns about a policy implemented under VA Secretary Doug Collins that abruptly limits the number of long-term one-on-one therapy sessions available to veterans, particularly those with chronic conditions like PTSD. While the VA claims it promotes efficient care and recovery, providers and veterans report that therapy is being ended prematurely without clinical justification, often without patient consent. Some providers face disciplinary action for challenging the policy, leading to staff shortages and burnout. Veterans describe being emotionally abandoned and re-traumatized, especially when they have built trust with their therapists. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged the reports and is investigating, emphasizing that individualized, recovery-oriented care based on shared decision-making is essential for veteran mental health. Critics argue that such limits are not clinically appropriate, especially for conditions requiring lifelong treatment, and that the policy undermines trust and long-term healing.",
