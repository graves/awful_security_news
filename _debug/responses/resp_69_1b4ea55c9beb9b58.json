The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit to defeat the New York Giants, with second-year QB Bo Nix leading a fourth-quarter surge. In a separate game, New England Patriots' quarterback Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise completion record (88.5%) with a 91.3% completion rate, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of passes, throw for over 200 yards, and rush for over 50 yards in one game. Meanwhile, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets suffered devastating losses, prompting immediate benchings: Tua Tagovailoa was replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers in Miami, and Justin Fields was benched at halftime in New York after a poor first half. The Green Bay Packers also secured a narrow win over the Arizona Cardinals, fueled by defensive dominance from Micah Parsons. The season continues to reflect a high level of unpredictability, with 26 lead changes in the final two minutes — the most in NFL history — illustrating the volatility and emotional intensity of the league.",
