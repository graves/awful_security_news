Ukraine is now using its drone technology as a key diplomatic and military asset, engaging NATO allies directly. Russia faces mounting pressure due to battlefield failures, economic issues, and shrinking support, especially from nations like India. The article suggests that while a lasting peace remains out of reach, the dynamics of the war are shifting—favoring Ukraine and indicating that Putin’s position is increasingly precarious, raising the urgent question of what his next move will be.",
