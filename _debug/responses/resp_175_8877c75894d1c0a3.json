  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Metropolitan Police is actively investigating claims that Prince Andrew sought personal information about Virginia Giuffre, a former alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew, through his police protection officer. The allegations include requests for her date of birth and social security number, which critics say violate the ethical standards of close protection services. Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in 2023, claimed she was forced into sexual encounters with Prince Andrew in 2001 at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell. Prince Andrew has denied all allegations, but has since voluntarily relinquished his titles and membership in the Order of the Garter, effectively ending his role as Duke of York. A 2019 BBC Newsnight interview and subsequent emails from February 2011 suggest that Prince Andrew maintained contact with Epstein, raising further questions about his claims of severed ties. The situation is compounded by the upcoming release of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which may reveal new evidence. Critics, including Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and Virginia Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts, argue that the prince’s actions indicate a lack of accountability and that broader institutional action, including removal of his title, is necessary.",
