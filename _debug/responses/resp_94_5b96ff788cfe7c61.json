  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) disrupted thousands of internet services globally, including banking, shopping, and social media platforms, due to a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS) that prevented access to AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services. The outage, which lasted several hours and affected users worldwide, particularly on the US East Coast, underscores the fragility of the internet’s current infrastructure, which relies heavily on a small number of cloud providers. Experts note that while AWS has not experienced such outages frequently, the concentration of critical services in a few cloud regions makes the system vulnerable to cascading failures. Past incidents, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network meltdowns, highlight similar vulnerabilities. Experts argue that the internet’s original decentralized design has been compromised by centralization, and without stronger redundancies or competition among cloud providers, such outages will continue to impact global digital operations.",
