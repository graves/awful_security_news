  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a reported international success with a Gaza ceasefire deal, public support for Donald Trump in the United States has not increased significantly. Polls show that while Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue slightly improved, it remains balanced with strong disapproval. His overall approval rating has dropped to a second-term low, driven more by negative perceptions of his economic policies — particularly inflation, cost of living, and job security — than by the foreign policy achievement. Americans show little interest in international events, with economic concerns taking precedence. This reflects a broader public skepticism toward Trump's leadership, where the adage 'it’s the economy, stupid' holds true, suggesting that domestic economic hardships outweigh foreign policy successes.",
