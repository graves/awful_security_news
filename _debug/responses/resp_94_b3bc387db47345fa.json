  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare 'ceasefire zones' that allow repair crews to operate. The plant has been without off-site power for four weeks—the longest blackout since the war began—forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), led by Director Rafael Grossi, says the restoration is vital for nuclear safety and that both Ukraine and Russia engaged constructively to enable the repairs. Ukraine blames Russia for intentionally cutting power to test reconnection, while Russia attributes the outage to Ukrainian shelling and claims its military is providing security for repairs. This is the tenth time since the war began that the plant has lost grid connection. A recent Russian strike on a substation in Slavutych, which affected the former Chernobyl plant, further highlights the ongoing aggression on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The situation raises global concerns about nuclear safety and the risk of a radiation incident in Europe.",
