  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline approached for nine U.S. colleges to sign the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,' several major institutions, including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, University of Virginia, and Dartmouth College, publicly rejected the agreement. The Compact, which would have required schools to bar transgender students from using restrooms or participating in gender-aligned sports, freeze tuition, limit international student enrollment, and mandate standardized testing for admissions, was criticized as inconsistent with academic merit, research integrity, and freedom of expression. Despite a White House virtual meeting with schools like UVA, Texas, and Vanderbilt, no agreements were reached, and multiple universities reaffirmed their refusal. The controversy underscores growing tensions between federal political directives and institutional autonomy in higher education, particularly around diversity, equity, and inclusion, and reflects a broader pattern of resistance to politically driven academic policies.",
