    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and has become widely recognized, symbolizing the decline in quality of internet platforms over time.",
    "Doctorow outlines a three-stage model of enshittification: Stage 1 (user-focused growth), Stage 2 (business-friendly practices that harm users), and Stage 3 (profit-driven degradation of user and business experiences).",
    "In Stage 3, platforms like Facebook and Amazon are accused of charging excessive fees, manipulating algorithms, and prioritizing ads over user interests, leading to poorer search results and higher prices for consumers.",
    "Amazon is claimed to be cloning products and charging sellers as much as 45–51 cents per dollar earned, with the best search results located 17 places down the page.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, arguing that platforms are protected by network effects and high switching costs.",
    "He proposes policy solutions including stronger antitrust enforcement, a shift from the consumer welfare standard to a more holistic approach, and greater interoperability between platforms to allow user data and content portability.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have disputed Doctorow’s claims, with Amazon stating its services have improved over time and denying the existence of 'junk fees' or product cloning, though they do not deny the existence of optional services."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article, written by Greg Rosalsky and based on Cory Doctorow’s new book, explores the phenomenon of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber over time. Doctorow outlines a three-stage model in which platforms begin by attracting users with good experiences (Stage 1), shift to prioritizing business customers with exploitative practices (Stage 2), and ultimately degrade into profit-driven systems that harm both users and merchants (Stage 3). He attributes this trend to a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight, and proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, the right to exit platforms, and greater interoperability. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, Doctorow cites studies and expert analysis to support his assertions, positioning the article as a timely critique of how dominant tech platforms have turned user-centric services into profit-first, often exploitative ecosystems.",
