  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has introduced new policies for its AI video tool Sora 2 following intense backlash from Hollywood studios, unions, and talent agencies over unauthorized AI-generated content featuring real people and copyrighted characters. Videos depicting Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, and even the CEO of OpenAI have been criticized as disrespectful, exploitative, and dehumanizing. Performers and their families, including Robin Williams’ daughter Zelda, have condemned such content as a violation of human dignity and artistic integrity. Talent agencies like United Talent Agency and Creative Artists Agency, along with the union SAG-AFTRA, have urged OpenAI to implement strict consent mechanisms, leading to support for the federal 'NO FAKES Act' to require permission before using digital replicas. OpenAI has responded by introducing an opt-in policy, blocking public generation of well-known characters, and removing non-compliant content, including videos of Martin Luther King Jr. and SpongeBob SquarePants. These developments reflect a growing ethical and legal debate about AI, consent, and the rights of performers in the age of artificial intelligence.",
