  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization, over 500 cancer survivors from across the U.S., including New York volunteers like Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and John Manna, united in Washington, D.C., during a citizen lobbying day to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and continued insurance subsidies. The event, organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, occurred amid a federal government shutdown and highlighted how personal experience with cancer transcends political affiliations. Volunteers, including both Democrats and Republicans, shared personal stories and focused on a common cause—improving health outcomes for cancer patients—ignoring political differences. While some lawmakers opposed subsidy extensions, bipartisan support was evident for research funding and screening. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where 10,000 tea lights honored lives lost to cancer, reinforcing the message that 'cancer doesn't care' about politics. The event serves as a powerful example of how shared human experiences can foster unity and advocacy in a politically divided nation.",
