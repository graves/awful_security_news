  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the sharp rise in orange juice prices in the UK, from 76p to £1.79 in just five years, as part of a broader trend of food inflation. This surge is driven by a combination of climate-related crop failures, disease (especially citrus greening), over-reliance on a few key exporters (Brazil and Florida), trade tensions (including US tariffs on Brazilian oranges and Canadian counter-tariffs), and new environmental regulations like Extended Producer Responsibility. Producers have responded by substituting oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins and mangoes, altering taste and composition. The story of orange juice prices reflects wider issues in the food supply chain, including market concentration, shifting consumer preferences, and rising global input costs. Experts suggest that while prices may eventually stabilize with better harvests and demand shifts, the current volatility signals a long-term structural change in food affordability, particularly for a country like the UK that imports most of its fruit.",
