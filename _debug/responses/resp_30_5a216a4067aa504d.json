  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The National Trust for Historic Preservation and other preservation groups are urging the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Critics argue that the project would overwhelm the existing structure, disrupt the historic classical design, and proceed without required public review processes. The East Wing, which includes key spaces like the first lady’s offices and a 1942-built visitor foyer, is being demolished without adequate oversight. While past U.S. presidents such as Harry Truman and Gerald Ford undertook major renovations, the current proposal lacks transparency and has prompted calls for a rigorous, public design and review process through established commissions like the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts.",
