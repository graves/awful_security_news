  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is capitalizing on the momentum from a fragile ceasefire agreement in Gaza, where he brokered the release of hostages and a halt to hostilities, to pursue broader diplomatic initiatives. He aims to leverage this credibility by pushing for a peace deal with Russia through a planned meeting with Vladimir Putin in Budapest and a summit with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea. However, the success of these efforts is hampered by the lack of leverage over nuclear powers like Russia and China, whose leaders are not dependent on U.S. support. In Ukraine, Trump appears hesitant to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles to President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing battlefield realities and fears of escalation, despite Ukraine’s requests. Meanwhile, issues like Hamas’s failure to return the bodies of deceased hostages threaten the stability of the Gaza deal, underscoring the fragility of such agreements. The article highlights that while Trump has demonstrated a track record of rapid, results-oriented diplomacy—inspired by George Mitchell’s '700 days of failure and one day of success' mantra—its long-term viability remains uncertain due to geopolitical complexities and inconsistent international cooperation.",
