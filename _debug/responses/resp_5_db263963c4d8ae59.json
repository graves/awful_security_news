  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, 68, was sentenced to death in Indonesia in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 with 3.8 kilograms of cocaine hidden in her suitcase, claiming she was coerced into carrying the drugs by a gang threatening her children. The sentence was upheld by Indonesia’s highest court. A similar case involving a 35-year-old British man, Shahab Shahabadi, who was arrested in Jakarta in 2014 and given a life sentence, led to a repatriation agreement between the UK and Indonesia in 2025. The agreement, signed by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Indonesia’s Senior Minister of Law Yusril Ihza Mahendra, spares both prisoners from execution, citing health concerns for Sandiford, who is seriously ill at 68. This reflects a broader trend under President Prabowo Subianto’s administration, where Indonesia has repatriated several foreign nationals, including a Filipina on death row and five Australians convicted of heroin trafficking. Indonesia, despite having strict drug laws and over 530 death row inmates (nearly 100 of whom are foreign nationals), has not carried out executions since 2016, raising concerns about human rights and the use of the death penalty for drug-related offenses. The repatriation is seen as a response to international pressure and a shift in diplomatic policy toward protecting vulnerable individuals, especially elderly and non-consenting participants in drug trafficking.",
