  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article debunks four common haircare myths, including the idea that cold water increases shine, that split ends can be repaired with products, that cutting hair speeds up growth, and that hair can self-clean. Experts Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker, along with Professor Laura Waters, explain that healthy hair comes from proper scalp care, avoiding extreme practices like cold showers or skipping washes, and using products responsibly—such as dry shampoo only occasionally. The core message is that simple, evidence-based hair care is more effective than expensive or trendy hacks, aligning with the broader public interest in science-backed personal health advice.",
