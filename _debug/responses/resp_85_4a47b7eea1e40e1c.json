  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new school superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a mandate introduced by his predecessor, Ryan Walters, that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and incorporated into school curricula for students in grades 5 through 12. The mandate, which was criticized by civil rights groups and led to a pending lawsuit, was seen as a violation of the separation of church and state. Fields emphasized that classroom decisions on religious instruction should be left to individual school districts and stated that taxpayer funds should not be used for Bible distribution. The state education department is also reviewing other controversial mandates from Walters, including a requirement for teachers from California and New York to pass an ideology exam, in light of growing concerns over religious and political indoctrination in public schools. This shift signals a broader effort to restore educational neutrality and accountability in the wake of contentious policies under the previous administration.",
