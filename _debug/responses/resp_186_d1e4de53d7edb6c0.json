  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the end of US financial aid to Colombia, citing President Gustavo Petro as a 'drug leader' who fails to curb drug production. The decision follows a 2025 US military strike on a Colombian fishing boat that killed fisherman Alejandro Carranza, prompting Petro to accuse the US of violating Colombian sovereignty and committing 'murder'. The US claims the strikes target drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, but lacks transparency about vessels or individuals involved, drawing criticism from UN human rights experts who call the actions 'extrajudicial executions'. This escalation comes amid a broader pattern of US military operations in the Caribbean, including attacks on Venezuelan vessels and threats of attacks on Venezuelan soil, which Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has condemned as efforts to make Venezuela an American colony. The situation reflects deepening tensions between the US and Latin American nations over sovereignty, drug policy, and military intervention.",
