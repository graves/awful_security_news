  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has launched a new, more sophisticated phase of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including a surgical drone strike on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 on October 10, which destroyed a critical transformer. This marks a shift from earlier attacks to a deliberate strategy of crippling power and heating systems ahead of a harsh winter. Russian drones and missiles have been modified to evade Western air defenses, significantly reducing interception rates. Simultaneously, corruption within Ukraine’s defense agencies has undermined protective measures, leading to ineffective, costly, and temporary solutions like sandbags. As a result, energy systems are at risk of collapse, with civilians stockpiling batteries, gas canisters, and alternative heating methods. Experts warn that Ukraine may face a severe winter without sufficient power and heating, endangering millions of lives.",
