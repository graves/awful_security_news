  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump and advanced by US Vice President JD Vance and envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is progressing better than expected, though challenges remain. Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of 28 deceased Israeli hostages, including Tal Haimi, showing partial compliance, but Israel continues to demand full accountability. Violence on Sunday, including a Hamas missile attack that killed two soldiers and led to Israeli airstrikes killing at least 45 Palestinians, raised fears of ceasefire collapse. Israel maintains military operations, citing security threats, while the US and Hamas push for disarmament, an interim Palestinian government, and withdrawal of Israeli troops. Humanitarian aid delivery is severely constrained, with only two crossings functional, and food shortages persist, especially in the north. The situation remains fragile, with both sides accusing each other of violations, and the long-term peace hinges on trust, compliance, and sustained international pressure.",
