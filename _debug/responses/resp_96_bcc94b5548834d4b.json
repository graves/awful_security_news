  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears in the woods near Myoko, Japan, during a routine run in early October 2025. The attack, which resulted in a broken arm and leg injuries requiring multiple surgeries, reflects a growing trend of bear attacks in Japan — with over 100 injuries and seven deaths reported in 2025. Experts attribute the rising incidents to climate change disrupting bears' traditional food sources, prompting them to venture into human areas. In response, the Japanese government has announced tougher measures to control bear populations. Halloran, despite physical and emotional trauma, remains committed to returning to running in nature, supported by local communities, and has adopted new safety measures like carrying bear spray. The incident underscores the increasing danger of wildlife-human encounters in changing environments and the urgent need for public awareness and policy action.",
