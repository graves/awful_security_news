  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Multiple prominent U.S. universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a White House proposal that offers expanded federal funding in exchange for implementing ideological policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, freezing tuition, and enforcing annual compliance polls. The proposal, sent to nine universities including Arizona State, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis, is framed by the administration as promoting a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and improving higher education through ideological alignment. However, university leaders argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition, warning that tying funding to ideology undermines innovation and free inquiry. The White House claims the compact would provide preferential grants and federal partnerships, while institutions emphasize their right to self-governance and independent decision-making. The compact is due for initial signatories by November 21, 2025, and while seven schools have declined, the University of Texas at Austin remains undecided, signaling a growing institutional resistance to federal control over academic policy.",
