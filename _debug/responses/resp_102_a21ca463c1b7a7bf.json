  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals that the reversal of decades-old advice—stopping babies from eating peanuts—has significantly reduced food allergies in the U.S. Over the past decade, since the 2015 LEAP study demonstrated that early peanut exposure reduces allergy risk, revised guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have promoted early allergen introduction. This shift has led to a 43% drop in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergies among young children, preventing at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy and 60,000 cases of food allergy. The findings are supported by data from over 120,000 children across the U.S., though experts caution that implementation has been inconsistent due to parental concerns and data limitations, such as reliance on diagnostic codes and lack of information about actual dietary habits.",
