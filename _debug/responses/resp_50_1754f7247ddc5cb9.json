    "Iceland, long believed to be free of mosquitoes due to its cold climate, has discovered its first confirmed wild mosquitoes of the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The mosquitoes were found in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and captured one at dusk on October 16.",
    "The insects were identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland; he confirmed three specimens (two females, one male).",
    "Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere, from North Africa to northern Siberia, and is adapted to cold climates by surviving in sheltered environments.",
    "This is the first known record of mosquitoes in Iceland's natural environment, unlike a previous isolated case from a plane at Keflavík Airport.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquito may have arrived via ships or cargo containers, but its survival through winter and potential establishment remains uncertain.",
    "Climate change is a likely factor in enabling mosquitoes to survive in Iceland, but experts remain cautious about directly linking the discovery to global warming.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson note that mosquitoes are already found in northern Scandinavia, suggesting that cold-adapted species may have been present long before climate change intensified.",
    "As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes are expanding their range, potentially bringing increased disease risks, making this event a relevant indicator of climate change impacts."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has officially recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes, identified as the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. The finding, initiated by Björn Hjaltason and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift, as mosquitoes have long been absent from Iceland due to its extreme cold. The species, native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere, appears adapted to survive harsh winters. While theories suggest arrival via ships or cargo, the long-term survival and establishment of the species remain uncertain. Experts note that while climate change may facilitate mosquito spread, it is not definitively proven to have caused this discovery, given that similar species are already found in northern Scandinavia. The event underscores the broader trend of climate-driven ecological shifts, where warming temperatures are expanding mosquito ranges and increasing disease risks globally.",
