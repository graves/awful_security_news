    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík.",
    "The discovery marks the first time mosquitoes have been found in Iceland’s natural environment, unlike a previous isolated case from an airplane in 1990s.",
    "The Culiseta annulata species is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates, allowing it to survive harsh winters through sheltered habitats.",
    "Possible introduction routes include ships or cargo containers, though the exact mechanism remains unclear.",
    "Experts are uncertain whether climate change directly caused the discovery, but warming temperatures may increase the likelihood of other mosquito species establishing themselves in Iceland.",
    "While climate change is likely to expand mosquito habitats globally, experts caution that correlation does not equal causation — many such shifts are still poorly understood.",
    "Iceland has already experienced extreme heat waves due to climate change, such as in May 2025, which may have indirectly facilitated the survival of mosquitoes."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long thought to be free of wild mosquitoes due to its extreme cold, has officially recorded its first confirmed natural occurrence of mosquitoes — specifically, three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — found in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík. The discovery, made after Björn Hjaltason observed a suspicious fly and reported it to entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift. While the species is known to survive cold climates through sheltered overwintering, experts remain uncertain about whether climate change directly caused the event. Possible introduction routes include ships or containers. The finding raises broader concerns about how global warming may expand mosquito habitats, even in traditionally inhospitable regions, though scientists caution that causation is not yet proven. This discovery underscores the dynamic nature of ecosystems in the face of climate change.",
