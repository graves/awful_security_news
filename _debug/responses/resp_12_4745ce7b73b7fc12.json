  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration secured a legal victory in Portland, Oregon, after a federal appeals court overturned a lower court order blocking the deployment of the National Guard, asserting that the president lawfully exercised his authority. However, a second restraining order remains in place, preventing immediate troop mobilization. The action sparked significant political and legal backlash from state leaders, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argue the deployments are disproportionate, unconstitutional, and harmful to local communities and military readiness. The situation reflects a broader national debate over executive power, state sovereignty, and the use of federal military force in domestic protests. Legal challenges are now underway in Illinois, Tennessee, and San Francisco, with multiple officials and lawmakers calling for a federal inquiry into the cumulative effects of these deployments, highlighting ongoing tensions between federal and state authority in the U.S.",
