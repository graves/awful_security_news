  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A United Airlines Boeing 737 flight (Flight 1093) from Denver to Los Angeles experienced a cracked cockpit window, likely caused by a weather balloon from WindBorne, a California-based weather technology startup. The incident resulted in minor injuries to the first officer, prompting an emergency landing in Salt Lake City. The airline and WindBorne are cooperating with the NTSB and FAA to investigate. WindBorne has already implemented operational changes to reduce exposure during high-altitude flight phases and is developing new technologies, including autonomous flight data-based avoidance systems and improved hardware, to prevent future incidents.",
