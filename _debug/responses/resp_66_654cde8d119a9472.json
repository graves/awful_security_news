They express deep concern over declining public trust in public health science, citing recent CDC guidance changes—such as the recommendation against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4—and false claims about vaccine safety. A measles outbreak in South Carolina, involving over 100 quarantined unvaccinated students, underscores the real-world dangers of declining vaccination rates. City health officials stress that public health decisions must be science-driven, not politically influenced, and that coordinated, cross-jurisdictional action is essential due to the lack of a unified federal system. Despite challenges, they remain committed to protecting communities, schools, and families through evidence-based vaccination messaging.",
