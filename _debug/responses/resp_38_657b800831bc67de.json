  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A fatal crash on Lisbon’s Glória funicular in September 2025 resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation. Preliminary findings by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal the cable failed to meet safety certifications or CARRIS operational standards. Maintenance records were falsified, with tasks marked as completed without actual execution, and the maintenance plan was falsely labeled as compliant. Eyewitnesses described the collapse as chaotic and sudden, with one man named Bruno recounting the scene as a 'toy being thrown' across the street. The crash has raised urgent concerns about safety protocols, oversight, and transparency in public transport infrastructure in Portugal, with a final report expected next year.",
