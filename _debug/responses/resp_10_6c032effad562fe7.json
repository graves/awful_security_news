  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring prior approval from the Pentagon's Office of Legislative Affairs for nearly all military officials and senior leaders to engage with Congress or state lawmakers, citing the need to coordinate messaging and avoid contradictions. The policy applies to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders, and defense intelligence offices, with an exception for the Inspector General’s office. While the Pentagon frames it as a necessary step to improve internal communication and accuracy, critics—including a Senate aide—argue it reflects a pattern of suppressing transparency and democratic engagement. A review led by Assistant Secretary Dane Hughes will assess the current processes and propose reforms. The policy comes amid broader concerns about information control and a lack of communication between the Pentagon and Congress, with critics noting significant logistical and practical challenges in enforcing such a broad restriction.",
