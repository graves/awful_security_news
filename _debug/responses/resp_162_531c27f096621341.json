  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and falsely claiming to be involved in freeing kidnapped journalist Cecilia Sala. The scam, which involved cloned voices and convincing audio calls, led to one victim, Massimo Moratti, transferring money, which was later frozen by authorities. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often rating them as more trustworthy. Global losses from AI deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025, prompting legal actions in the US and Australia. While AI voice cloning has beneficial applications, such as helping people with speech impairments, its misuse poses serious risks including identity theft, financial fraud, and the creation of fake or sexually explicit content involving real individuals.",
