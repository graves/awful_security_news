  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a tragic explosion in Niger state, Nigeria, dozens of villagers died after collecting spilled fuel from a tanker that had crashed due to poor road conditions. The incident occurred near Essan and Badeggi communities on the Bida-Agaie road in Katcha Local Government Area. At least 30 to 35 people were killed and over 40 injured, with conflicting official figures. The crash, which transported petroleum from Lagos to the north, highlights a persistent and dangerous pattern of people collecting fuel from spilled tankers despite repeated public safety warnings. This is part of a broader trend in Nigeria, with similar disasters occurring in Jigawa state (October 2024, 153 deaths) and Suleja, Niger state (January 2025, 86 deaths), emphasizing systemic road safety and infrastructure failures. The Federal Road Safety Corps and National Emergency Management Agency responded, but reporting inconsistencies suggest challenges in crisis management. Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago condemned the incident, calling it 'worrisome, unfortunate and pathetic,' underscoring the failure of public awareness efforts.",
