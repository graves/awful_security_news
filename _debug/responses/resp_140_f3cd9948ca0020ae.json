  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Human Rights Watch has issued a report alleging that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon through its supply chain. The investigation reveals that cattle raised on illegally deforested land in Pará—such as within protected Indigenous and sustainable development areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa—are being transported via a 'laundering' system that obscures their origins. This occurs through Brazil’s current animal transit permit (GTA) system, which only tracks bulk shipments and lacks individual animal tracing. As a result, JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are free from deforestation-linked sourcing. Despite past commitments to trace suppliers—such as in the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement—JBS has failed to meet those deadlines. The report calls for stronger government action, including mandatory traceability systems and public access to GTA data, to hold corporations accountable and stop the expansion of illegal ranching, especially in a critical context where the UN will hold its COP30 climate summit in Pará.",
