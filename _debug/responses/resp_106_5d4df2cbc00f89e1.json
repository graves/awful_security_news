She reflects on the 2024 presidential debate, where she observed President Biden's health and voiced concerns about optics, while firmly maintaining that he was fit for office. Jean-Pierre attributes the Democratic Party's 2024 defeat to a failure to unify behind Biden, exemplified by public doubts from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney. She also highlights the marginalization of Black women voters within the party, calling for recognition of their critical role. Her decision to become independent is not a political defection, but a call for accountability, transparency, and a reimagining of American politics to address systemic inequities and political disengagement. The article frames her experience as both a personal journey and a broader critique of modern American political culture.",
