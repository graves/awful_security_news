  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former Colorado dentist, James Craig, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by systematically poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic, potassium cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline from Visine eyedrops. Over several weeks, Craig conducted extensive online research, ordered toxic substances, and used his professional access to a dental office to hide and store lethal materials. His plan included replacing her medication with cyanide and using fake medical justifications to justify purchases. Evidence from digital searches, purchase records, and hospital visits revealed a detailed, methodical scheme. Angela, who had previously been hospitalized due to unexplained symptoms, died on March 18, 2023, after a final hospitalization. Office staff, including Caitlin Romero and Dr. Ryan Redfearn, discovered the cyanide delivery and raised concerns, ultimately contributing to the exposure of the crime. The case underscores the dangers of online research into poisons and the critical role of workplace vigilance in preventing such tragedies.",
