  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is in a prolonged shutdown, affecting over 2.4 million workers who are going without pay and causing widespread disruptions in essential services such as Head Start, WIC, and air traffic control. The conflict centers on Republican resistance to Democrats’ demands for extended health care subsidies, with President Donald Trump and key Republican senators refusing to negotiate. The shutdown is projected to cost the economy 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of growth per week, and without action, millions of Americans face rising health care costs after subsidies expire on December 31. As the crisis nears critical deadlines—especially November 1, when ACA enrollment begins—Democrats warn that public access to affordable coverage will be jeopardized. The White House is hosting a lunch with Republican senators, but both sides remain entrenched, with Democrats urging Trump to take a more active role and Republicans maintaining their stance of intransigence.",
