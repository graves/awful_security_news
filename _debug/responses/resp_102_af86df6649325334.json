The project, announced by President Trump in July 2025, is being privately funded by Trump and major American companies, with Carrier Global Corp. donating HVAC systems. The ballroom will accommodate up to 999 people, far exceeding the East Room's capacity of 200. The demolition has sparked legal and historical concerns, especially given the East Wing’s long history and role as a base for the first lady. The White House claims the project respects the original structure and will not touch the main building, though offices will be temporarily relocated. No formal review or approval has been submitted, and the project remains under legal scrutiny due to procedural violations and potential overreach in federal oversight.",
