  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former U.S. Representative George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in December 2023 after pleading guilty to fraud charges related to falsified campaign information, was released from prison on October 18, 2025, following a commutation of his seven-year sentence by President Donald Trump. Santos, who admitted to fabricating parts of his biography, had been serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, and was reportedly subjected to prolonged solitary confinement. Trump cited mistreatment and a lack of fairness in the system as reasons for the commutation, with Santos himself writing an open letter pleading for a chance to rebuild. The move drew support from Republican lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene and others, but faced criticism from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who accused Trump of diverting attention from pressing national issues like the healthcare crisis. The incident underscores broader debates about political accountability, campaign ethics, and the use of executive clemency in the U.S. political system.",
