The project, which will accommodate up to 999 people, is being privately funded with contributions from wealthy companies and individuals, including Carrier Global Corp., which has donated an HVAC system. While the White House claims the construction will not interfere with the main structure and will temporarily relocate offices in the East Wing, the move raises legal and procedural concerns due to the absence of required federal oversight. The project represents the most significant structural change to the White House since the 1948 Truman Balcony addition, and it has been publicly promoted by Trump as a long-term vision to modernize hosting capabilities and replace outdated pavilions on the South Lawn.",
