The agreement, signed in Doha and confirmed by both sides’ leadership, includes a mutual pledge to refrain from hostile actions, supporting militants, or targeting civilians and infrastructure. The Durand Line, a long-standing point of contention, remains a flashpoint, with key border crossings like Chaman and Torkham still closed. While the ceasefire provides relief to stranded refugees and affected businesses, a follow-up meeting in Istanbul on October 25 is scheduled to ensure implementation and address bilateral claims. The agreement marks a significant diplomatic effort to de-escalate tensions amid deep-seated historical and political grievances.",
