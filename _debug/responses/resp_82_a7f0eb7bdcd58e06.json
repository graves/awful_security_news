  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears during a routine run in the woods near Myoko, Japan. The attack left him with a severely injured arm and leg, requiring multiple surgeries, including a hip graft and metal plate insertion. Bear attacks in Japan have surged in 2025, with over 100 injuries and seven deaths, driven by climate change disrupting traditional bear food sources and prompting bears to venture into human-populated areas. The Japanese government has responded with tougher bear control measures, and residents are advised to carry bear deterrents. Halloran, though traumatized, remains determined to recover and return to running, emphasizing community support and the broader environmental crisis linked to climate change.",
