  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the dramatic rise in orange juice prices in the UK, which have increased by 134% since 2020, from 76p to £1.79 per litre. This price surge is driven by a confluence of factors including disease (citrus greening), extreme weather, over-reliance on key suppliers like Brazil and Florida, trade wars and tariffs, and new environmental regulations such as Extended Producer Responsibility. As a result, manufacturers are substituting oranges with cheaper alternatives like mandarins and mangoes. While global demand for orange juice has fallen by 30% due to health concerns and shifting tastes, the underlying structural vulnerabilities in food supply chains remain. These disruptions are part of a broader pattern of rising food prices, including in beef, butter, and coffee, suggesting that food inflation is not an isolated incident but a systemic issue. The UK's heavy dependence on imported food makes it particularly vulnerable to global shocks, raising questions about long-term food security and whether consumers can expect prices to remain high in the future.",
