The new ballroom, which will seat 650 people and feature gold-themed design elements, will replace the traditional office space used by first ladies. Funded by Trump and private donors, the project reflects his personal aesthetic and vision for a more luxurious, event-focused White House, echoing the gilded interiors of his private clubs. The White House argues that such renovations are historically justified, citing the Truman-era reconstruction as precedent. The project has sparked public debate, with critics questioning the preservation of historical integrity, while the administration defends it as necessary modernization. The construction also coincides with Trump’s broader efforts to transform the White House’s architecture and grounds, including redecorating the Oval Office and paving over the Rose Garden.",
