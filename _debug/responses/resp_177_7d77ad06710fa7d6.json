  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has begun demolishing parts of the White House’s East Wing to construct a new $250 million ballroom, which he claims will be located nearby but not touching the existing structure. The project, privately funded by unnamed 'Patriots,' has bypassed the National Park Service’s standard review process, drawing criticism from architectural historians and professionals who argue that such a major change to a 1942-era historic building should undergo rigorous design and approval. While the White House has released architectural drawings and confirmed contractor involvement (Clark Construction and McCrery Architects), concerns remain about the historical integrity, transparency, and long-term implications of altering a site considered the 'People's House.' Past presidents like Truman, Nixon, and Obama have similarly modified White House facilities, but this project stands out due to its scale, lack of oversight, and public controversy.",
