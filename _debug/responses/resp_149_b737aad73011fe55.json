  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false and scientifically unsupported claims in October 2025 that linking autism to infant circumcision, citing two studies — a 2013 cross-national analysis and a 2015 Danish study — that show only weak and non-causal associations. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, emphasize that both studies have significant limitations: small sample sizes, lack of data on acetaminophen use, and failure to account for confounding variables. The 2025 WPLab preprint paper, which Kennedy cited, is not peer-reviewed and claims acetaminophen causes autism, contradicting established scientific consensus. Decades of research confirm acetaminophen is safe when used as directed, and no evidence supports a causal link to autism. The article highlights how misinformation, especially from individuals with close ties to unverified research groups, can mislead public health discourse.",
