  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in 2025, tourists continue to visit national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite despite closures, lack of entrance fees, and absence of rangers. While some businesses, such as tour operators in West Virginia and California, report increased activity, others face revenue losses. Advocacy groups warn about safety risks, including illegal drone use and base jumping, and environmental degradation like trash buildup due to reduced staffing. In West Virginia, state funds and political leadership kept key parks open for economic and cultural reasons. In Washington, D.C., closures of public institutions such as the Smithsonian museums led to a surge in visitors to nearby private museums. However, the overall economic impact on local businesses—especially small ones—is significant, with estimates of lost revenue and growing concerns about long-term sustainability and visitor safety. The article underscores the delicate balance between maintaining access to natural and historical sites and ensuring public safety and environmental stewardship during periods of government inaction.",
