  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During Diwali 2025, millions of Indians celebrated the Festival of Lights with widespread lighting of oil lamps, especially in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, where over 2.6 million lamps were lit on the Saryu River to honor the return of Lord Rama. The event, which retained a Guinness World Record, involved thousands of volunteers, religious rituals, and public festivities. However, the celebrations were accompanied by severe air pollution, with New Delhi’s air quality reaching 347 on the AQI — 14 times the WHO’s safe limit — prompting concerns over environmental and public health. In response, India’s Supreme Court lifted a blanket ban on firecrackers, permitting limited use of 'green firecrackers' that emit 30% fewer pollutants. This reflects a growing tension between preserving cultural traditions and addressing environmental challenges during one of India’s most significant festivals.",
