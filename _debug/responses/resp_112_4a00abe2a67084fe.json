  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government is in a prolonged shutdown as Congress fails to pass a funding bill, with the Senate refusing to support a House-passed stopgap measure. While the Trump administration has taken unilateral steps to mitigate impacts — such as covering military and law enforcement pay, using tariff revenue for a nutrition program, and ensuring pay for 70,000 DHS officers — Democrats argue these actions are illegal and prolong the impasse. The situation is being exacerbated by growing public awareness of rising health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act, particularly as open enrollment begins on November 1. Democrats are leveraging this financial pressure to force negotiations, while Republicans remain resistant, citing the need for a post-government-reopening deal on health care subsidies. The political stalemate reflects deeper divisions over executive power, the role of federal funding, and the impact of policy decisions on public welfare.",
