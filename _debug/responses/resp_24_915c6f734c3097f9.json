  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza by Hamas, following a handover on Saturday. The other body, that of Israeli citizen Ronen Engel, was also identified, with his family expressing grief and a sense of loss. Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies outlined in the ceasefire agreement, but the process remains under strain due to delays, ongoing Israeli military strikes, and allegations of Hamas using the hostages’ remains as leverage. The US State Department warns of an imminent ceasefire violation, and Hamas denies wrongdoing, claiming it has delivered all accessible remains. Israel insists that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is demilitarized. Protests have erupted in Israel, and the Rafah crossing remains closed, further restricting humanitarian access. The article underscores the emotional, political, and humanitarian toll of the hostage crisis and the fragile nature of the ceasefire.",
