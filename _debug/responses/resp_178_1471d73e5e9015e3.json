  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark legal case in Los Angeles County Superior Court has ordered executives from major social media companies — including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel, and Instagram’s Adam Mosseri — to testify in a trial over claims that their platforms are addictive and harmful to young users' mental health. The case, which consolidated hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, alleges that companies designed apps to keep users engaged through features like 'likes' and weak parental controls, despite knowing of potential risks. Judge Carolyn Kuhl rejected Meta’s argument that in-person testimony was unnecessary, citing the unique insight CEOs have into product design and decisions about user safety. The trial, expected in January, marks one of the first major legal actions to hold tech companies accountable for design-related negligence, challenging the precedent of federal platform immunity laws that previously shielded them from liability for user content or mental health harms.",
