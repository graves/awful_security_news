    "Tech CEOs such as Dario Amodei, Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are making bold claims about AI writing a significant portion of code.",

    "Despite AI’s ability to write code, experts like Boris Cherny and Simon Willison stress that every line of code must be reviewed by a human engineer, as AI lacks higher-level problem-solving and critical thinking skills.",
    "AI tools such as Anthropic’s Claude Code and OpenAI’s models use 'agents' that can auto-test and rewrite code, but these agents can go into 'death spirals' and produce unworkable or messy code.",
    "Studies show mixed results: a METR study found experienced engineers took 19% longer with AI tools, while a Danish survey reported a modest 6.5% time saving.",
    "AI is most effective for low-accuracy tasks (e.g., quick prototypes), not complex systems requiring deep reasoning.",
    "Misuse and over-reliance on AI—such as when high-level engineers attempt to do complex projects solo—leads to unworkable, messy code and wasted effort, creating a phenomenon called 'workslop'.",
    "Some companies, like Amazon and Meta, push AI adoption aggressively, even when not necessary, which may pressure engineers to conform and reduce dissent.",
    "Concerns about job displacement of junior software engineers and the environmental cost of training large models are growing among engineers.",
    "Only about half of software engineers trust AI responses, with 30% expressing little to no trust, indicating skepticism about AI's reliability."
