    "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is rising faster than all other breast cancers combined in the U.S., increasing by about 2.8% annually versus 0.8% for other types.",
    "ILC accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses in the U.S., with about 47,500 cases diagnosed each year.",
    "ILC is difficult to detect with routine mammograms because it spreads in thin strands that resemble normal breast tissue, leading to missed diagnoses.",
    "Women aged 60 and older are most commonly diagnosed with ILC, with 70% of new cases occurring in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.",
    "The steepest rise in ILC incidence is among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, with a 4.4% annual increase.",
    "ILC is often hormone receptor-positive, meaning it responds to estrogen or progesterone, and treatment typically includes surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy or targeted drugs.",
    "The rise may be linked to hormonal changes, rising obesity and alcohol use, shifts in childbearing and menopause patterns, and longer post-menopausal life spans.",
    "Improved diagnostic awareness and better classification of lobular cancers may also contribute to the increased detection rates.",
    "Lifestyle factors such as quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying physically active can reduce the risk of ILC and other breast cancers.",
    "Women should be aware of breast changes like thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, or new fullness and seek medical advice promptly."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal *Cancer*, the journal of the American Cancer Society, reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer that is difficult to detect on routine mammograms, has been rising in the United States at a rate more than three times faster than all other breast cancers combined — increasing by about 2.8% annually from 2012 to 2021. ILC accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, with about 47,500 cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. The most significant rise is observed among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, with a 4.4% annual increase. Women aged 60 and older are most commonly affected, with 70% of cases diagnosed at that age or older. The study attributes the rise to hormonal changes, rising rates of obesity and alcohol consumption, shifts in reproductive patterns, and longer post-menopausal lifespans. Experts like Dr. Leana Wen emphasize that ILC spreads in thin strands that mimic normal tissue, making it invisible on standard mammograms, and recommend additional imaging like ultrasound or MRI for high-risk individuals. Treatment includes surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, and in some cases, chemotherapy or targeted drugs. Prevention strategies include maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, avoiding smoking, and staying physically active. The article underscores the need for improved awareness, tailored screening, and public health initiatives to combat this rapidly rising and hard-to-detect form of breast cancer.",
