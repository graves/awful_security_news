  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have introduced a $380 penalty per tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was originally approved in April 2025 by 63 member states. Trump’s public condemnation of the IMO's voting in London, coupled with threats of visa restrictions and port levies, caused a shift in delegate sentiment, resulting in a 57–49 vote to postpone the decision. Key supporters like China, the EU, Brazil, and Britain remained committed, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or shifted their positions. The delay undermines global climate goals, as the shipping sector is a major contributor to emissions, and the International Chamber of Shipping and Vanuatu have voiced strong concerns over the lack of clarity needed for decarbonization investments. This decision reflects broader political resistance to climate action, particularly from fossil fuel-dependent nations, and highlights the tension between environmental imperatives and economic interests.",
