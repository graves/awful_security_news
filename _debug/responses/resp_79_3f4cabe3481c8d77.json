  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal that some believed would bolster Donald Trump’s global standing and possibly earn him a Nobel Peace Prize, public sentiment in the United States shows little enthusiasm. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC indicates that while Trump’s approval on the Gaza issue slightly increased, it remained balanced with disapproval, and his overall approval rating on domestic economic issues has reached a low point, with 62% disapproving of his handling of inflation and cost of living. Public skepticism is further fueled by declining confidence in the economy, with only 32% expecting economic improvement and 31% expecting wage growth. The article concludes that Americans are prioritizing economic concerns over foreign policy achievements, reflecting a broader trend where domestic issues—especially inflation and job security—outweigh international developments, and that past failures of peace agreements reinforce a wait-and-see attitude toward the Gaza deal’s longevity.",
