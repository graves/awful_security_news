  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to the deadly fungus Metarhizium brunneum by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase their distance from foragers, showing proactive social distancing. When exposed to the fungus, ant colonies build nests that are more compartmentalized, less interconnected, with wider entrances and longer travel routes, reducing disease transmission. These structural changes complement social behaviors to create a form of 'architectural immunity'. This study, led by behavioral ecologist Nathalie Stroeymeyt and systems biologist Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, is the first to demonstrate such active spatial modification in non-human social species. The findings contribute to the understanding of social immunity in insects and offer potential inspiration for human-designed public spaces that reduce disease spread by isolating vulnerable areas and minimizing interaction hotspots.",
