  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mexico has suffered a major flooding disaster in recent days, with at least 64 fatalities and 65 people still missing across five states, primarily Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla. The event, triggered by the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, brought unprecedented rainfall—up to 286mm in Cuetzalan del Progreso and 280mm in Cerro Azul—leading to river overflows, landslides, and widespread destruction. Thousands of military personnel have been deployed to provide emergency aid, including food and clean water, while nearly 400 repair workers have restored over 80% of electricity to affected areas. The government has acknowledged a lack of early meteorological warnings that could have predicted the severity of the rains, raising concerns about disaster preparedness and early alert systems.",
