Seven universities — including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Dartmouth College, USC, and MIT — have rejected the offer, citing serious concerns about academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding. These rejections signal a growing resistance among elite universities to what they perceive as an overreach of federal power and a threat to core academic values. The administration argues that the compact would promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and provide competitive advantages through federal grants and events, while universities emphasize that free inquiry and institutional independence are essential for innovation and national competitiveness.",
