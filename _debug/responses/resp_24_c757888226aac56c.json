  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, 68, was sentenced to death in Indonesia in 2013 for smuggling 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, claiming she was coerced by a criminal gang threatening her children. Her death sentence was upheld by Indonesia’s highest court. Another British national, Shahab Shahabadi, has been serving a life sentence since 2014 for methamphetamine trafficking. In October 2025, a bilateral agreement between the UK and Indonesia led to their repatriation, sparing both from execution. The agreement reflects broader international diplomatic efforts to protect foreign nationals facing death sentences in Indonesia, where around 100 foreigners are on death row and drug-related crimes remain prevalent. This case highlights the tension between strict drug laws and human rights considerations, especially in a country known as a major drug trafficking hub despite its harsh penalties. The involvement of UK officials like Yvette Cooper and Indonesian officials like Yusril Ihza Mahendra underscores governmental engagement in human rights diplomacy.",
