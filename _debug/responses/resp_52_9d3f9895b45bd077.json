  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six of nine universities—MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—have rejected a White House proposal to join a funding compact that would provide preferential access to federal grants in exchange for ideological changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. The compact, initially drafted in December 2025 and sent on October 1, 2025, includes a requirement for annual anonymous polls to enforce compliance. Universities argue that such demands threaten academic freedom and institutional autonomy, with leaders emphasizing that merit-based research and governance independence are paramount. While some schools like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, others, including Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, are still reviewing the proposal. The Trump administration frames the compact as a way to improve higher education through ideological alignment, but critics view it as an effort to exert undue control over academic institutions. State leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom have added additional pressure by threatening to withhold state funding to institutions that participate, deepening the national debate over the role of government in academic governance.",
