  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A powerful storm, described as having the fury of a Category 2 hurricane and named Typhoon Halong, devastated remote Alaska villages, particularly Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, destroying up to 90% of homes and leaving over 2,000 people displaced. Governor Mike Dunleavy requested a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to access federal funds for emergency and long-term recovery. Rescue operations relied heavily on military airlifts, with evacuees initially housed in Anchorage facilities such as the Alaska Airlines Center and convention centers. Due to extreme damage and the harsh Arctic climate, many survivors are unlikely to return home for at least 18 months. Personal stories from residents like Alexie Stone and Nellie Unangiq Jimmie highlight the emotional and lifestyle disruptions caused by displacement, while Anchorage leaders pledge support to integrate evacuees into the community. The event underscores the vulnerability of isolated Arctic communities to extreme weather and the need for resilient infrastructure and federal disaster preparedness.",
