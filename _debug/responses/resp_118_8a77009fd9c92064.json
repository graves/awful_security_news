  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A divided panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, ruling that the President lawfully exercised his authority to federalize troops due to violent and disruptive protests at an ICE facility. The court emphasized that the President must consider the totality of events, not just isolated incidents, when making deployment decisions. While the ruling removes one legal barrier, a second restraining order remains in place, so full deployment is not yet certain. The decision is controversial, with state officials and legal experts arguing that the protests were peaceful and that such deployments risk undermining democratic norms and state control over public safety. The case reflects a broader national debate over executive power, the use of military force in domestic settings, and the balance between federal and state authority.",
