  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to end the war, including surrendering parts of the Donbas region in exchange for Russian-held southern territories. European officials reported that Trump raised his voice and grew frustrated, while Zelensky described the exchange as 'pointed' but constructive. Trump ultimately proposed a ceasefire along current battle lines, rejecting the idea of Ukraine regaining all lost territory. This shift marks a departure from Trump’s earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all its land, and reflects his current focus on ending the war quickly, influenced by his success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. The meeting is seen as a significant diplomatic event, highlighting tensions between U.S. and Ukrainian positions on war resolution and territorial integrity.",
