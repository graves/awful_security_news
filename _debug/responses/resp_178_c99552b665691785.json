  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew's ability to live in the grand Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate is due to a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate that required large upfront payments—totaling around £8 million—covering renovations and effectively eliminating future annual rent obligations. The deal, originally seen as financially responsible to taxpayers, now faces public and political scrutiny due to renewed allegations linking Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.

The National Audit Office is reviewing the arrangement to assess whether public funds are being misused, and political figures including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick have called for greater accountability from the royal family.",
