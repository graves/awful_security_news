  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how President Trump has used the federalization of state National Guard forces to advance aggressive immigration enforcement, particularly in Democratic-led cities such as Chicago, Memphis, and Los Angeles. Despite legal prohibitions under the Posse Comitatus Act, which bans federal military from domestic policing, the administration has deployed National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and guard federal agents. These actions are framed by Trump as efforts to combat crime driven by undocumented immigrants, though data show that such a link is unfounded. In reality, the deployments blur the lines between traditional law enforcement and immigration enforcement, creating widespread fear among residents, especially immigrants and U.S. citizens. Communities report confusion over who can arrest whom, as federal agents often wear military-style gear or masks. Legal experts argue that the pattern of deployments—often tied to protests and raids—forms a cycle where aggressive enforcement sparks unrest, which in turn justifies military intervention. Previous operations, such as Operation Lone Star in Texas, show a history of using military tactics against migrants. While the National Guard cannot make arrests, their presence has led to increased anxiety and legal challenges, including court rulings in California and ongoing appeals. The article underscores a growing concern that the administration is using militarized enforcement to legitimize its immigration policies, undermining civil liberties and community trust.",
