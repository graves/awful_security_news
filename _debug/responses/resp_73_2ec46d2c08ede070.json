  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Shohei Ohtani delivered a historic performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three home runs—427, 469, and 446 feet—pitched six innings in a shutout, struck out 10 batters, and became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game and the first to hit a leadoff homer in the playoffs. This performance, achieved after pitching in just 13 days, made him the first player in MLB history to hit three home runs and strike out 10 batters in a single game. Ohtani was named NLCS MVP, and the Dodgers’ strong postseason run—losing only one game—sets them up as a formidable World Series opponent. With no team having repeated as World Series champions since the Yankees’ 1998–2000 run, the Dodgers’ return to the Fall Classic is a major moment in baseball history, widely recognized as the 'Shohei Ohtani Game.'",
