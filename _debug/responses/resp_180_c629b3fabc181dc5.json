  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO and the Western Australian Museum discovered two new species in the deep sea off Western Australia during a 2022 research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park: a tiny, semi-transparent porcelain crab (1.5cm long) feeding with hairs and a glowing West Australian Lantern Shark (up to 40cm) found at depths over 600m. These discoveries highlight Australiaâ€™s status as a global biodiversity hotspot, with over a million species, many still unexplored. Out of the hundreds of specimens collected, 20 new species have been identified, with scientists estimating that around 600 more remain to be described and named due to the lengthy process of classification and verification.",
