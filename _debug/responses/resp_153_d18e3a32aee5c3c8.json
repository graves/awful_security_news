The watchdog warns that such AI advice undermines democratic integrity due to lack of transparency and bias, urging both voters and AI developers to refrain from using these tools for political decision-making. This comes amid political instability in the Netherlands, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, has pushed for a coalition break over immigration policy, setting the stage for a closely contested election on October 29.",
