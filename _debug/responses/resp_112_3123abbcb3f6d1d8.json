  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge has ordered the return of books on race, gender, and LGBTQ+ issues to school libraries at military bases, after students and families alleged that the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) violated their First Amendment rights by removing such materials in response to executive orders from President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. These orders banned instruction on Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and DEI, and prohibited celebrations such as Black History Month, Women's History Month, and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Schools canceled events, removed posters of figures like Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo, and teachers were instructed to eliminate discussions on sensitive topics. The ACLU filed a motion on behalf of students, arguing the removals were politically motivated and not based on educational needs. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled that the actions were improperly partisan, and ordered the immediate restoration of all removed books and curricular materials.",
