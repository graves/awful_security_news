  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study showed that early introduction of peanut products to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that the guidance issued in 2015 and expanded in 2017 has led to a significant decline in allergy rates. The rate of peanut allergies dropped by over 27% and then over 40% after the guidelines were introduced, with about 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies since 2015. The study, led by Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and based on electronic health records, shows that early allergen exposure — including small amounts of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products — is now being adopted and making measurable public health impacts. This shift is supported by the 2015 LEAP trial, which demonstrated a more than 80% reduction in allergy risk. Advocates like FARE emphasize that the 2021 updated guidelines recommend introducing allergens between 4 and 6 months of age without prior testing, and that this change is both scientifically sound and increasingly adopted by families and pediatricians.",
