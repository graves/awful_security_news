  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eugenio Suárez hit a grand slam in the bottom of the eighth inning, giving the Seattle Mariners a 6-2 lead over the Toronto Blue Jays and moving them just one win away from their first-ever World Series appearance. This marks the second grand slam in franchise postseason history and a pivotal moment in a long-standing history of near-misses. The Mariners, who have never made it to the Fall Classic, are now leading the series 3-2, with Game 6 set for Sunday in Toronto. The emotional impact of Suárez’s hit, amplified by the presence of his daughters and the historic crowd noise, underscores the significance of the moment. Cal Raleigh’s game-tying homer in the eighth inning — the first in that inning since 2001 — also played a key role in the momentum shift. The article draws on historical context, including the 1995 ALDS win over the Yankees and the 2001 ALCS, to highlight how this moment could finally break the franchise’s long drought in reaching the World Series.",
