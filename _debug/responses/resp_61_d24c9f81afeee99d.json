Federal officials, including CBP Deputy Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Shawn Byers, testified to explain their actions, with Harvick confirming that all over 200 CBP agents in Chicago wear body cameras. Judge Ellis expressed concern that the order is not being followed, particularly regarding the deployment of tear gas without prior warning. She also requested that Russell Hott, the former ICE field office head in Chicago, and Gregory Bovino, CBP chief patrol agent, be deposed later for full transparency. Protests continue at the Broadview ICE facility, with multiple arrests reported, highlighting ongoing tensions between immigration enforcement and community activism.",
