  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging former FBI Director James Comey’s lead defense attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, claiming he may have a conflict of interest due to allegations that Comey used Fitzgerald to share classified information in 2017. Prosecutors argue that communication between Comey and Fitzgerald, including memos about their interactions with President Trump, contained classified content, even if later upclassified. Fitzgerald counters that the memos were initially unclassified and authored by Comey himself, who was an Original Classification Authority. He cites an inspector general’s report finding no evidence of classified information release. Legal experts emphasize that a person who is a witness in a case cannot serve as a defense counsel, raising ethical and procedural concerns about Fitzgerald’s current role. The dispute centers on whether Fitzgerald’s prior role in the communications chain disqualifies him from representing Comey fairly.",
