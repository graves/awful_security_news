  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. district judge, Phyllis Hamilton, has barred Israeli spyware company NSO Group from targeting WhatsApp users, ruling that its software, Pegasus, causes irreparable harm by enabling unauthorized access to users’ devices through reverse engineering and covert attacks such as zero-click exploits. The court found that NSO’s actions interfere with WhatsApp’s core promise of informational privacy, and although an initial damages award of $168 million was reduced to $4 million due to insufficient evidence of particularly egregious behavior, the injunction is permanent and specific to WhatsApp. The ruling marks a significant precedent in digital privacy law, affirming that companies offering encrypted services must be protected from exploitation by state actors or spyware firms. The decision does not extend to Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, as the court lacks evidence of similar harms. This case highlights the global concern over the misuse of surveillance technology by nation-states and the need for stronger legal accountability.",
