  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. It poses significant threats of flash flooding and mudslides in Haiti and the Dominican Republic due to heavy rainfall, with a hurricane watch in place for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. A low but non-zero chance exists for Melissa to impact the U.S., primarily through rough seas and rip currents along the East Coast, with Florida and the Bahamas as potential secondary areas. The storm's development reflects broader climate trends, such as warming ocean temperatures, which are fueling rapid intensification in storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. While the most likely track takes Melissa toward Hispaniola, a westward path toward Central America is also possible. The article underscores that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is not ending quietly and that climate change is contributing to increasingly powerful storm behavior.",
