  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a college student, Shannon Keeler, at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after being extradited from France. The assault had gone without prosecution for nearly a decade, with Keeler’s efforts to pursue justice being delayed by institutional reluctance and the destruction of critical evidence. Cleary sent a Facebook message in 2019 stating 'So I raped you,' which reignited Keeler’s pursuit of justice. After a three-year search and his arrest in Metz, France, on a vagrancy charge, Cleary pleaded guilty and expressed remorse. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, considered Cleary’s mental health history and remorse, resulting in a sentence below state guidelines. The case highlights systemic failures in campus sexual assault prosecutions and the power of survivor advocacy in achieving accountability.",
