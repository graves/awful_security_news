Despite the project's scale and public visibility, the administration has not obtained approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates major renovations on federal property. The demolition of the historically significant East Wing—long a base for the first lady and key offices—has raised concerns about historical preservation, regulatory compliance, and the displacement of staff. Trump asserts the ballroom fulfills a long-standing presidential need, citing a lack of space in the East Room and opposition to hosting dignitaries on the South Lawn. Carrier Global Corp. has donated HVAC systems, and the project is scheduled for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029. The White House has not disclosed donor information or submitted formal plans for review, adding to public skepticism about transparency and legality.",
