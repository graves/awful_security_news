  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the collapse of Build a Rocket Boy’s first game, MindsEye, a sci-fi adventure launched in June 2025, which was widely criticized for severe bugs, poor performance, and technical flaws. The failure stemmed from a toxic workplace culture led by founder Leslie Benzies, who is accused of micro-managing teams through 'Leslie tickets'—instructions for minor or major fixes that took precedence over other work. Employees report being ignored, burned out during mandatory 'crunch' periods, and silenced when raising concerns. The studio, which had raised over £233 million in investment and grown to 448 employees by 2024, faced severe financial losses, including £202.6 million in cumulative losses. Following the launch, between 250 and 300 staff were laid off, with union claims of a mishandled redundancy process. The company takes responsibility for the launch failure and claims it is committed to future improvements, but former employees remain skeptical about recovery and the sustainability of the studio’s model. The incident raises broader concerns about creative leadership, workplace culture, and the health of the video game industry in the UK.",
