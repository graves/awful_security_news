The move escalated tensions with Democratic governors, who argue the deployments violate state constitutions and set a dangerous precedent for military overreach. In Memphis, Gov. Bill Lee authorized the Guard’s presence amid high violent crime, while a judge in California ruled the deployment in Los Angeles illegal. The Supreme Court, which has previously favored Trump’s executive actions, is now central to resolving the constitutional and legal conflict over federal authority versus state rights, especially in the context of immigration enforcement and emergency military action.",
