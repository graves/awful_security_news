  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College. The case remained unprosecuted for over a decade due to institutional reluctance and lost evidence. In 2019, Cleary sent a Facebook message stating 'So I raped you,' which retraumatized Keeler and reignited her efforts. After a three-year search and Cleary’s extradition from France in 2024, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two to four years in prison by Senior Judge Kevin Hess. The judge cited Cleary’s remorse and mental health history as mitigating factors. Keeler, who had waited 12 years for justice, described the case as a long struggle against a system that failed her. This case reflects broader challenges in prosecuting campus sexual assault, including evidence destruction, prosecutorial inertia, and the emotional toll on survivors.",
