While no threats to safety or security were found, the incidents disrupted operations, caused passenger confusion, and led to emergency measures such as shutting down the systems and using megaphones. Authorities, including the US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Transport Canada, the FAA, and the RCMP, are investigating the attacks, which are part of a growing trend of cyberattacks in the aviation sector. The events highlight vulnerabilities in airport communication systems and the potential for politically motivated hacks to target public infrastructure.",
