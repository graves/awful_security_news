  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article explores the dynamics of India’s gold market ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras, highlighting how soaring gold prices—now exceeding $1,440 per 10g—have led to a shift in consumer behavior. While demand for gold jewellery remains strong due to cultural traditions, buyers are now opting for lighter, more affordable pieces or switching to investment forms like gold bars, coins, and ETFs. Data from the World Gold Council shows that investment demand has risen sharply, from 19% to 35% in a single year, while jewellery's share fell from 80% to 64%. The Reserve Bank of India has also increased its gold reserves, contributing to global demand. Despite high prices, the cultural attachment to gold and its role as a wealth store ensures sustained demand, though lower-income families are increasingly priced out, with some delaying purchases until prices fall.",
