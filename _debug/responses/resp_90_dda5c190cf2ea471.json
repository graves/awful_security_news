    "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted in Maryland on October 16, 2025, on 18 counts: eight for transmitting and ten for retaining classified national defense information.",
    "The indictment alleges that Bolton created and shared digital diary entries containing classified information — including TOP SECRET-level material — via personal email accounts (AOL, Google), which were used to communicate with family members who lacked security clearances.",
    "Prosecutors claim Bolton used personal non-governmental email accounts and stored classified documents on personal devices in his home, in violation of federal law.",
    "The case originated from a 2021 Iran hack of Bolton’s emails, during which he allegedly failed to disclose that he was sharing classified material.",
    "Bolton claims the charges are politically motivated, arguing that the Trump administration’s Justice Department targeted him as part of a broader pattern of weaponizing the DOJ against political opponents.",
    "The investigation was initiated under the Biden administration and has been supported by career prosecutors and investigators, unlike earlier politically charged cases involving figures like Comey and James.",
    "The case is being handled by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014.",
    "Legal experts consider the charges potentially more severe than those in past classified information cases due to the alleged active dissemination of top-secret information to non-clearance individuals."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted in Maryland on October 16, 2025, on 18 counts of transmitting and retaining classified national defense information, including TOP SECRET-level data, through personal email accounts and physical diaries. Prosecutors allege that Bolton shared over a thousand pages of diary-like notes with family members who lacked security clearances, starting after an Iran hack of his emails in 2021. The investigation was launched under the Biden administration and has been supported by career law enforcement officials, distinguishing it from politically driven prosecutions. Bolton claims the case is a politically motivated attack by the Trump-aligned Justice Department, citing that no charges were filed during the Biden years despite prior scrutiny. Legal experts believe the case may be among the most serious in U.S. history involving classified material due to the active dissemination of top-secret information to non-clearance individuals. The case is currently pending before U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed by Barack Obama in 2014, and Bolton is expected to surrender to authorities soon.",
