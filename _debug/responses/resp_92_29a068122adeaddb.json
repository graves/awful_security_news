Trump later publicly urged both Ukraine and Russia to stop the war immediately and accept current battle lines, asserting that continued fighting is too complex. Zelensky described the meeting as productive but declined to comment further, citing US concerns about escalation. Trump previously suggested land swaps for peace but later stated he believes Ukraine could reclaim all occupied territory.
