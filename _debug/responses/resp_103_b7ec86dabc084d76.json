  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid organizations (INGOs) operating in Gaza and the West Bank, including banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from sending aid. The new registration process, overseen by COGAT and requiring approval from a committee including representatives from Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, allows Israel to de-register organizations for reasons such as supporting 'terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism,' which aid groups argue are ideologically vague and politically motivated. Key organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps are either denied registration or in appeal processes, effectively shutting them down. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that pledged increased aid, Israel continues to block crossings, with only two of seven border crossings open and many aid trucks stalled in Egypt and Jordan. UNRWA, which had been the largest provider of aid in Gaza for decades, holds supplies sufficient to feed the population for three months, but is blocked from delivery. The U.S. cut funding to UNRWA last year, deepening financial instability, while the European Union has stepped in to partially cover the gap. Humanitarian officials describe this as a deliberate strategy to limit aid access and silence organizations that criticize Israeli policies, raising serious concerns about the state of humanitarian access in occupied territories.",
