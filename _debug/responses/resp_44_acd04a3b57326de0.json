  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article exposes the severe labor abuses in Guatemalan garment factories, known as maquilas, where women workers face long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite being crucial to Guatemala’s economy—contributing nearly 10% of GDP—the sector operates under opaque supply chains dominated by Korean companies. US brands such as Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren source garments from these factories without direct responsibility for working conditions. Workers, including Rutilia Cano and Corina Olivares, describe being denied pensions, facing union threats and violence, and being unable to exit due to financial hardship. The Guatemalan Ministry of Labor struggles to enforce regulations, with factory owners blocking inspections and union leaders like Anastacio Tzib Caal being murdered. Although President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms such as a 6% wage increase, systemic issues persist. The article underscores a gendered supply chain crisis, where women workers are especially vulnerable, and warns of future instability due to U.S. import tariffs and ongoing lack of accountability in global fashion supply chains.",
