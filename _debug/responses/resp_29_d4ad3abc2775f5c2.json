  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a federal case in Chicago, Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ruiz are accused of ramming a Border Patrol vehicle on October 4, 2025, resulting in Martinez being shot. The defense argues that the vehicle’s condition—especially its physical state and internal data like the EDR—is crucial to proving the agent initiated contact. However, the vehicle was removed from Chicago and transported over 1,000 miles to Maine, raising serious concerns about evidence tampering. The defense claims the government may have altered the vehicle, and a judge has ordered it returned to Chicago under strict conditions, with no alterations allowed. Legal experts caution that while the government may not face punishment unless proven to have acted with bad faith, the case highlights a troubling pattern of movement of evidence and people in federal immigration cases, undermining public trust in transparency and accountability.",
