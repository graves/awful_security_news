This meeting occurs amid rising trade tensions with the United States, especially under President Donald Trump, and amid domestic challenges such as a collapsing property market, youth unemployment, and overcapacity in industries like autos. Key priorities include maintaining economic growth near 5%, boosting consumer spending, and advancing technological self-sufficiency—particularly in artificial intelligence and semiconductors. While the full plan will be officially unveiled at the National People’s Congress in March 2026, economists note that policy shifts may be incremental rather than radical. The leadership’s focus on stability, legitimacy, and national power underscores the importance of this political event both domestically and globally.",
