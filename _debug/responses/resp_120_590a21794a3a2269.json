  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and advisor to both New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s education secretaries, identified a critical inequity in American education: low-income students, despite being talented and hard-working, are systematically excluded from elite universities. This insight, reinforced by data from economist Raj Chetty showing that elite colleges are the least socioeconomically diverse, led her to launch the National Education Equity Lab in 2019. The initiative evolved into the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), which brings college-level courses—like Harvard’s poetry class—into Title I high schools. NEON supports students through teacher training, mentorship, and college navigation, with 80% of students passing courses. Data from Robert Balfanz shows that NEON students are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges and persist longer. With support from the Carnegie Corporation, Gates Foundation, and private donors like Henry McCance, NEON has expanded to 33 states and over 40,000 students. Its long-term goal is to serve 1 million Title I students within a decade, a feat that would surpass the number of low-income students taking Advanced Placement exams annually. Despite its small size—only 32 staff and $7.5 million annual revenue—NEON has proven more effective than large-scale private interventions, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Newark investment or the Gates Foundation’s Small Schools Initiative, due to its lean, data-driven, and scalable model.",
