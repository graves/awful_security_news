  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under the Biden-Harris administration, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she attributes the Democratic Party’s 2024 electoral defeat to internal disunity, including public doubts from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney, and a failure to stand united behind President Biden. She recounts observing Biden’s health during the 2024 debate, noting his hoarseness, yet maintains confidence in his fitness. Jean-Pierre also highlights how Black women voters—despite their loyalty and political awareness—have been marginalized within the party. She attributes her shift to independence not to political defection, but to a need for accountability and a call to reimagine American politics. Her message is one of urgency: silence is complicit, and the public must engage to prevent political harm, especially in response to policies like Project 2025 that target DEI and immigrant communities.",
