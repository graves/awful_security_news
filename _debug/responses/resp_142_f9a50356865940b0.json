    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, now restricting 12 out of the 17 known rare-earth elements, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium.",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw materials and specialized refining equipment used to process rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals from China.",
    "The new controls are justified under national security grounds, citing concerns over foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military applications.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth of such goods in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China between 2020 and 2023.",
