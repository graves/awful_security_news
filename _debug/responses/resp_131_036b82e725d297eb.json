  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz has been elected Bolivia’s first conservative president in over two decades, winning 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election. His victory marks a decisive break from decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism party and signals a new era in Bolivia’s political and economic direction. Paz has pledged to rebuild ties with the United States, including engaging directly with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and to attract foreign investment by restoring trust in institutions. He rejected a proposed IMF bailout, emphasizing that foreign relations and economic reform must come after domestic 'house cleaning,' including targeted fuel subsidies for the poor and efforts to reform a judiciary seen as politically biased. The election also triggered protests from supporters of the losing candidate, Jorge Quiroga, who had advocated for IMF intervention. Paz’s campaign, bolstered by social media-savvy running mate Edman Lara, successfully mobilized rural and working-class voters, but faces pressure from former leftist allies like Evo Morales, who warns against neoliberal policies. The shift represents a major regional transformation in Latin America, with Bolivia moving away from Venezuela’s repressive regime and toward greater alignment with Western democracies and economic markets.",
