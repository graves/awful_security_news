  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a White House funding proposal that offers expanded access to federal research grants in exchange for significant ideological policy changes. These demands include eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment at 15%, enforcing annual anonymous compliance polls, and adopting specific biological definitions of gender. The universities argue that such mandates threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based competition, which are essential to innovation and excellence in higher education. The White House claims the compact promotes a diverse 'marketplace of ideas' and provides a competitive advantage through prioritized funding and access to events. While some institutions like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, others have firmly rejected the proposal, citing threats to their core mission. The compact, which was drafted in December 2024 and initially sent to nine universities, has now expanded to include three additional schools, with a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories.",
