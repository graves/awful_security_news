  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, issued a strict order requiring federal immigration agents in Chicago to wear body-worn cameras and refrain from using tear gas or other force without warning during protests. The order came in response to reports that agents during Operation Midway Blitz—a Trump administration-led crackdown resulting in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois—deployed tear gas and pepper balls without prior notice. Federal officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, but Judge Ellis remained unconvinced, expressing serious concerns about non-compliance and calling for more transparency. She specifically demanded that ICE’s former Chicago head, Russell Hott, be deposed to explain actions taken during the protests. Protests at the Broadview ICE facility continued, with multiple arrests reported, highlighting ongoing public resistance to immigration enforcement. The case underscores tensions between federal immigration policy and civil liberties, with the judiciary asserting oversight to ensure accountability and transparency.",
