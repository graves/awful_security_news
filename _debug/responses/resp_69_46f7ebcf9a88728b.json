  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legitimacy of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed the usual Senate confirmation process. The Department of Justice argues that the appointment is lawful through delegation of authority by the Attorney General, citing precedent and administrative practices. However, legal counsel Abbe Lowell contends that delegating full US attorney powers—such as oversight of investigations and personnel—is unconstitutional and unprecedented. The case raises broader questions about executive power, political obstruction, and compliance with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, has criticized Congress for blocking nominations, and the dispute has sparked similar legal challenges in other states. The controversy also intersects with ongoing legal battles involving former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, indicating wider implications for federal accountability and the balance of power in the executive branch.",
