This financial strain threatens essential activities such as vaccination and surveillance, especially in high-risk areas like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where 36 wild polio cases were reported in 2025. The GPEI is responding by focusing resources on high-risk regions, adopting fractional dosing to stretch vaccine supplies, and collaborating with other health campaigns like measles programmes. Despite the challenges, officials maintain that eradication remains feasible with sustained global commitment, emphasizing the continued importance of vaccination and surveillance to combat both wild and vaccine-derived polio.",
