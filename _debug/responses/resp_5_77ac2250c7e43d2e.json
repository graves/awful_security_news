  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, alleging that Speaker Mike Johnson unlawfully delayed the swearing-in of newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva from Arizona, citing a constitutional obligation to seat duly elected members. Johnson claims he is following precedent established by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asserting he will only administer the oath upon the House’s return from recess. However, the lawsuit argues that the Constitution does not grant the Speaker authority to unilaterally delay swearing-in, especially when no constitutional or practical reason exists for refusal. The suit claims Johnson’s delay is politically motivated—aimed at blocking a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and advancing his position in budget negotiations. Arizona argues that the delay harms democratic representation and the interests of its constituents. The case is now being heard in Washington, D.C. federal court, with a request to allow a qualified third party to administer the oath if Johnson refuses.",
