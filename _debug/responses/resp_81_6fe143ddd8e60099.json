  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, citing the 'realities of the conflict' and urging a ceasefire along current battle lines. The meeting, held on October 19, 2025, saw Trump grow frustrated and raise his voice, contrary to Ukrainian claims that the discussion remained constructive. While Trump later clarified that he did not demand a full surrender of Donbas, he emphasized that the conflict should end at existing frontlines. This marks a significant shift from his previous stance, where he suggested Ukraine could regain all lost territory. The episode follows a recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a territorial swap involving eastern Donbas for Russian-held southern areas. European officials and Ukrainian sources noted the tension, though Zelensky ultimately supported a ceasefire along current lines. Trump’s approach is being shaped by his broader commitment to ending wars quickly, exemplified by his recent success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. The meeting reflects deepening diplomatic rifts and evolving U.S. policy on Ukraine’s war effort.",
