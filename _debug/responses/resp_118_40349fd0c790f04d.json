  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a closely contested gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are vying for the governor's office. Despite New Jersey’s historically blue political leanings in presidential and Senate races, the state has a long history of electing governors from both parties, making this race politically significant. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is supported by national figures including former President Barack Obama, and she has criticized Ciattarelli’s past work in opioid-related materials and his ties to President Donald Trump. Ciattarelli, a longtime state politician and pro-Trump figure, received Trump’s endorsement and has responded by accusing Sherrill of refusing to walk at her naval academy graduation during a cheating scandal. The campaign has become increasingly personal, with both candidates launching accusations and threats of defamation. Voter concerns about rising costs of living—especially energy prices and property taxes—remain central. While polling shows Sherrill leading, the race remains unpredictable, with political experts noting that the outcome could hinge on who best addresses affordability and public trust.",
