  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores President Donald Trump's failed diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, contrasting his successful ceasefire deal in Gaza with his inability to secure a similar resolution in Ukraine. In Gaza, Trump leveraged Israel’s military action against Hamas negotiators in Qatar to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into agreement, benefiting from strong ties to Israeli leaders and Arab allies. In Ukraine, however, Trump lacks comparable leverage, with Russian President Vladimir Putin showing little interest in diplomacy and Ukraine's leadership, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, indicating that concessions would be politically unsustainable. Despite proposing a summit with Putin in Budapest and threatening sanctions and arms shipments, Trump’s face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky have yielded no tangible progress. Zelensky notes that as Ukraine loses access to long-range weapons, Russia becomes less interested in negotiations. Trump’s earlier campaign promise to end the war in hours has been abandoned in favor of a more realistic assessment of the conflict's complexity and intractability, highlighting the limitations of his personal influence in resolving long-term, high-stakes geopolitical conflicts.",
