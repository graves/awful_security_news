  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bolivians have elected Rodrigo Paz of the centre-right Christian Democratic Party (PDC) as president, ending nearly two decades of MAS party rule. With 54.5% of the vote in the run-off election—after 97% of ballots were counted—Paz defeated right-wing candidate Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga, who received 45.4%. Paz, 58, is the son of former left-wing president Jaime Zamora and has served as mayor of Tarija and senator. He has promised a 'capitalism for all' agenda featuring tax cuts, tariff reductions, and decentralization. The election followed the MAS party’s major defeat in August’s preliminary vote, due to term limits barring Evo Morales from running and internal divisions, especially after Arce opted out of re-election. Bolivia faces a deep economic crisis, including 25% annual inflation, fuel and food shortages, and declining energy revenues from $6.1 billion (2013) to $1.6 billion (2024). While Paz has pledged to reduce fuel subsidies, he has not clearly committed to ending them. The new government still faces opposition from Evo Morales, who remains popular among Indigenous populations and criticizes the new leadership as unrepresentative of the people.",
