  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The proposed world’s first global carbon tax on the shipping industry, aimed at reducing climate pollution, collapsed after a four-day negotiation at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) summit in London. The U.S., under President Donald Trump, led a strong campaign against the tax, branding it a 'scam tax' and threatening sanctions on countries supporting it. Despite support from the European Union, Brazil, and small island nations like Vanuatu, the tax was delayed by 12 months. Experts warn that the failure undermines decades of climate diplomacy and increases the risk of worsening emissions, with the shipping industry responsible for around 3% of global warming pollution and projected to rise to 17% by 2050. The collapse also raises concerns about the effectiveness of international climate negotiations, especially ahead of the upcoming COP30 conference in Belém, Brazil.",
