  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a highly coordinated seven-minute heist that occurred just after the Louvre in Paris opened on 19 October 2025, thieves stole eight of nine items from the French Crown Jewels, including a tiara, necklace, and brooches worn by queens and empresses. The attackers, believed to be a team of four, used a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder to force open a window in the Apollo Gallery, where they removed valuable royal artifacts. One item, the crown of Empress Eugénie, was damaged, and a yellow vest used for disguise was found at the scene. No injuries were reported, but the museum was closed for security and evidence preservation. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and Culture Minister Rachida Dati, condemned the attack as a severe blow to national heritage. Investigators are exploring foreign involvement and have opened a formal case for aggravated theft and criminal conspiracy. Experts warn that thieves may melt or recut the jewelry, risking irreversible loss of cultural integrity. This marks the first major robbery at the Louvre in over a century, highlighting the vulnerability of even the world’s most secure cultural institutions.",
