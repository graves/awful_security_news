  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system designed to reduce shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. Trump's public statement on Truth Social, calling the measure a 'Global Green New Scam Tax,' led to a shift in the vote, with 57 members backing a postponement to late 2026. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Brazil had previously backed the framework, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it. The NZF would have imposed a $380 penalty per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, aiming for a 20% reduction in shipping emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050. The delay has been criticized by climate officials and shipping industry leaders as a setback to global climate efforts, undermining progress in decarbonizing maritime transport and raising concerns about the role of political interference in environmental policy.",
