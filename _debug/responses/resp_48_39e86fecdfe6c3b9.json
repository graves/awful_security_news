  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The proposed world’s first global carbon tax on the shipping industry, intended to fund climate action and drive emissions reductions, collapsed after a fierce opposition led by the Trump administration. Despite support from the European Union, Brazil, and small island nations like Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia resisted, citing economic harm and calling the tax a 'scam.' The International Maritime Organization delayed a vote on the tax by 12 months after a motion by Singapore, following intense diplomatic pressure from the U.S., which threatened sanctions on supporting countries. Experts warn that this failure undermines decades of climate negotiations, increases the risk of continued climate pollution from shipping, and weakens global climate diplomacy, raising concerns about the success of future climate talks like COP30 in Belém.",
