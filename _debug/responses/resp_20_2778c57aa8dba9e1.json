  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue to advance in Ukraine, using increased aerial bombardment—including record numbers of guided bombs and drones—targeting Ukrainian military and infrastructure. Key frontlines include Kupiansk and Vovchansk in Kharkiv, and Pokrovsk in Donetsk, where fighting remains intense. Ukrainian forces claim to have halted major offensives and maintain strategic initiative, though Russia has gained approximately 120 square miles in the past four weeks. The conflict has led to heavy Russian casualties, with over 250,000 soldiers reported dead or wounded, prompting concerns over recruitment and possible reliance on reserve forces. Ukraine is responding with long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting one-fifth of refining capacity. Despite massive costs and battlefield setbacks, Russian President Vladimir Putin remains resolute in refusing ceasefire negotiations, and the war remains unresolved after more than 1,300 days.",
