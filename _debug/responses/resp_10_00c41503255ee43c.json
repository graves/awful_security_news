  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration achieved a legal victory in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by overturning a lower court order that blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, asserting that the President lawfully exercised his authority under statutory provisions. However, a second restraining order remains in effect, preventing immediate troop mobilization. The decision, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, drew criticism from Judge Susan P. Graber, who argued it undermines state sovereignty and First Amendment rights. State leaders, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, have challenged the deployment as disproportionate and unconstitutional, and have requested an en banc review of the ruling. The broader context includes similar legal challenges in Illinois and Tennessee, where officials argue the administration lacks legal justification for troop deployment. In San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie and Governor Gavin Newsom have rejected deployment plans, emphasizing that the city is safe and the National Guard does not have arrest authority. A group of senators has also requested an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these deployments, citing risks to military readiness and constitutional overreach.",
