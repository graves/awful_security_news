  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the ongoing detention of at least 95 Palestinian healthcare workers by Israeli authorities, with 80 from Gaza and 15 from the West Bank. Most were abducted from hospitals or ambulances while on duty, and many have faced torture, abuse, and denial of medical care. Dr Hussam Abu Safia, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, is a central figure, having been arrested on December 27, 2024, and held without charge under the controversial Unlawful Combatants Law. Over 1,720 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years, and hospitals have been extensively damaged. As of October 20, 2025, 22 families have not received updates, and five detainees are missing. A protest in London by healthcare workers, co-organized by Healthcare Workers Watch and Amnesty International UK, demands the immediate and unconditional release of all detained medics. The situation is seen as a serious violation of international humanitarian law, with healthcare workers targeted for their professional roles, exacerbating a already devastated health system in Gaza.",
