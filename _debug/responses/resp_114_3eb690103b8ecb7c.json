The root cause was a software update error in AWS's DynamoDB database service, located in Northern Virginia, which triggered a chain reaction of service failures. AWS, which holds about 30% of the global cloud computing market, serves as a critical backbone for internet operations, and this outage highlights the systemic vulnerability of modern businesses to failures in centralized cloud infrastructure. Experts warn that while relying on major cloud providers offers convenience and strong security, it also creates significant risks—when one provider fails, the ripple effects can disrupt financial services, gaming platforms, social media, and even healthcare operations. This incident echoes earlier outages like the 2024 CrowdStrike failure, reinforcing growing concerns about over-concentration in a few technology providers.",
