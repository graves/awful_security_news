  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following a four-week blackout—the longest since the war began—due to the loss of its sole off-site power line. The restoration efforts are being enabled by rare local ceasefire zones established between Ukrainian and Russian forces, with both sides engaging constructively through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA’s Director Rafael Grossi emphasized that off-site power restoration is essential for nuclear safety. Ukraine blames Russia for deliberately cutting power to test grid reconnection, while Russia attributes the outage to Ukrainian shelling. Meanwhile, a recent Russian strike on a substation in Slavutych caused a major blackout at the former Chernobyl site, raising concerns about broader regional radiation risks. The situation underscores how ongoing military aggression directly threatens nuclear safety across Ukraine and Europe.",
