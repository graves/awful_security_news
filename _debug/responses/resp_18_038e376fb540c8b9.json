  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a federal vehicle ramming case in Chicago, Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ruiz are accused of attacking a Border Patrol agent by following and ramming a government vehicle. The defense argues that the condition of the agent’s SUV—especially its event data recorder—is crucial to proving that the agent initiated contact. However, the vehicle was removed from Chicago to Maine, where it was stored at a CBP station, raising serious concerns about potential tampering or alteration. Defense attorneys, including Christopher Parente, insist that the government must return the vehicle to Chicago under judicial order, with no changes allowed. Judge Georgia Alexakis has ordered the return, citing concerns over the integrity of evidence. Legal experts point to the 1984 Supreme Court decision in *California v. Trombetta* to argue that prosecutors must preserve evidence if it may exonerate a defendant. This case is part of a broader pattern of movements of physical evidence and individuals in immigration enforcement cases, raising alarm about transparency, due process, and the integrity of federal investigations. The trial is set to begin in February 2026, and the outcome may hinge on whether the vehicle’s condition remains unchanged and whether the government acted in good faith.",
