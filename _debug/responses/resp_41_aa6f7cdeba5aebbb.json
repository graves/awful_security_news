  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Billy Joe Cagle, from Cartersville, Georgia, was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted authorities that he was armed and intended to 'shoot it up'. Although not armed at the time of arrest, police found an AR-15 assault rifle in his vehicle. Cagle faces multiple charges, including terroristic threats, aggravated assault attempts, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Authorities note that Cagle has a prior marijuana conviction and is described as mentally challenged. The incident occurred just before 9:30 a.m., with Cagle already present at the airport's south terminal, drawn to the crowded TSA check-in area. Thanks to early detection and inter-agency coordination between Cartersville and Atlanta police, the threat was averted. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem commended the successful outcome. The Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the world's busiest, makes this event particularly significant due to its scale and global impact.",
