  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sanae Takaichi has been elected as Japan’s first female prime minister in a parliamentary vote held on October 21, 2025, following the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba and a political vacuum after the LDP's defeat in July. Takaichi, a longtime LDP member and protege of Shinzo Abe, won 237 votes in the lower house, defeating opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda. Her election is historic but controversial due to her conservative views on gender and sexuality—opposing same-sex marriage, male-only imperial succession, and separate surnames—while appointing only two female ministers. Her governing coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party is fragile and lacks a majority, raising concerns about instability and policy effectiveness. Takaichi’s nationalist policies, including her association with the Yasukuni Shrine, have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, though the EU has welcomed her leadership with diplomatic support. Internationally, the event is seen as a milestone in gender representation, yet one that comes with significant social and geopolitical tensions.",
