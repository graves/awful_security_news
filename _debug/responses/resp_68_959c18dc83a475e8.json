    "A Slovak court convicted Juraj Cintula of terrorism for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, writer, and public activist, admitted to shooting Fico five times from a distance of over one meter.",
    "Fico was seriously injured, with wounds to his abdomen, hip, hand, and foot, and has since returned to public duties despite ongoing health issues.",
    "The court ruled that Cintula targeted a political leader specifically, supporting a terrorism charge over lesser charges of murder or attack.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies, which he said damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and described the attack as a 'scream against fear that is paralyzing the society'.",
    "The verdict reflects deep societal divisions between populist Fico and liberal, pro-EU opposition parties.",
    "Fico has accused the opposition of undermining democratic standards, while opposition leaders claim Fico has eroded media freedom and covered up corruption.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism, but the court found that targeting a prime minister was intentional and politically motivated.",
    "Cintula stated he would appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust', and the case remains a symbol of political polarization in Slovakia.",
    "Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula, signaling a personal reconciliation despite the serious nature of the attack."
