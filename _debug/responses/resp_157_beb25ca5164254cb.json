    "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and prominent Palestine solidarity activist, was detained in March 2025 by immigration authorities over his activism at Columbia University, becoming the first high-profile Palestinian rights advocate to face deportation for political expression.",

    "Khalil’s legal team, including ACLU’s Bobby Hodgson, argues that expressing opinions on Palestine or immigration is protected under the First Amendment and that the government cannot use vague immigration laws to suppress dissent.",
    "A lower court granted Khalil’s release in June 2025 via a habeas corpus petition, which is unrelated to the separate deportation case and does not resolve the immigration removal process.",
    "An immigration judge previously sided with the government, ordering Khalil’s removal; this decision is now being appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals and potentially to a circuit court on constitutional grounds.",
    "A separate federal judge last month ruled that the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists violated free speech protections, reinforcing the significance of Khalil’s case in the larger context of political speech and immigration enforcement.",
    "The legal battle underscores a growing national debate over whether the U.S. government can use immigration laws to target individuals for expressing political views, especially those related to Palestine or immigrant rights."

The U.S. government seeks to deport him, arguing his presence has 'adverse foreign policy consequences,' a claim challenged by civil rights groups like the ACLU. A New Jersey district court granted him release through a habeas corpus petition, which is now being contested by government lawyers claiming lack of jurisdiction.
