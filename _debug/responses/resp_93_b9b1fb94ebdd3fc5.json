  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits habitual drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistan citizen indicted in 2023 for drug and gun possession. The Trump administration defends the law, claiming habitual drug users pose a public safety risk, especially during police encounters. However, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a ban lacks historical precedent and should only apply to individuals under active drug influence. The case raises critical questions about the Second Amendment and how historical justifications apply to modern drug laws. The decision may be influenced by the broader political context, including the 2024 conviction and subsequent pardon of Hunter Biden, who was also charged under the same law. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025, potentially setting a precedent on gun rights and drug-related restrictions.",
