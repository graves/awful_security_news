  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal being seen as a major diplomatic victory, American public opinion reveals little enthusiasm. Polling data from late October 2025 shows that while Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly increased, disapproval remains high — with overall approval of his leadership at a historic low. His economic performance, particularly on inflation and the cost of living, is viewed far more negatively than his foreign policy achievements. Public anxiety over economic conditions, such as job security and wage growth, is rising, and foreign policy is ranked low in national priorities. These dynamics suggest that Americans are largely indifferent to the Gaza deal, placing much greater weight on domestic economic issues, which may ultimately define Trump’s political standing.",
