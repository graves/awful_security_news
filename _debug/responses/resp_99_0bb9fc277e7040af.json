This action follows a string of resignations and firings in the office, including that of Maggie Cleary, who opposed the indictment of James Comey, and career prosecutors Michael Ben’Ary and Maya Song. Troy Edwards Jr., a career prosecutor and son-in-law of Comey, also resigned. Halligan has taken an unusually active role in courtroom proceedings, signaling a deepening conflict between political appointees and experienced, career prosecutors. These actions suggest a shift in the Justice Department’s priorities—focusing on politically motivated prosecutions of Trump critics rather than national security or legal integrity. The situation reflects growing concerns about the politicization of the federal justice system.",
