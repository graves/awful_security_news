  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recently held nearly two-and-a-half-hour phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged directly with U.S. President Donald Trump to avert discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could threaten Russian cities. Putin framed the call as 'positive and productive,' highlighting that such weapons would damage U.S.-Russia relations—a point he believes Trump values. The conversation also included praise for Trump’s diplomatic achievements in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza. A second face-to-face summit in Budapest, Hungary, was agreed upon, offering renewed hope for peace talks. However, Russia continues to insist on maximalist war goals, including control over annexed Ukrainian territories and postwar restrictions on Ukraine’s sovereignty. Ukrainian officials suggest that the threat of missile supply prompted Putin’s diplomatic outreach, indicating that personal engagement and the promise of a short-term win may be more effective than actual compromise in influencing U.S. policy.",
