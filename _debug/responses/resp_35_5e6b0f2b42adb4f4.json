  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman reported missing in Philadelphia on October 4, 2025, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school after an anonymous tip prompted investigators to re-examine the site. DNA testing confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and other offenses. Cellphone data and video evidence show that King had contact with Scott and that his vehicle—a stolen black Hyundai Accent—was seen at a recreation center on the night of her disappearance. The car was later found on fire, with investigators suspecting arson. Prosecutors believe King may have been involved in her disappearance, and additional charges are being pursued. While King was previously arrested in a separate kidnapping case, those charges were dropped due to witness non-appearance. Kada Scott’s parents described her as a person of kindness and light, and expressed deep grief over her loss. Authorities say further investigation is underway into possible involvement of other individuals.",
