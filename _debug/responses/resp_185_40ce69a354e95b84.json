  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Subramanyam 'Subu' Vedam, a legal permanent resident of the United States, was wrongfully imprisoned for over 40 years for the murder of his former roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student, despite having no physical evidence linking him to the crime. After new evidence exonerated him and a Pennsylvania district attorney decided not to pursue a new trial, Vedam was finally released from prison. However, before he could reunite with his family, he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which seeks to deport him to India — a country he has not lived in since infancy. His family and legal team argue that the deportation is unjust, given his decades of good behavior, community service, and strong ties to the U.S., and that the 1988 deportation order was based on a drug conviction that remains valid, even after the murder charge was dismissed. The case raises serious questions about how immigration enforcement agencies apply historical convictions, especially when those convictions are based on false or unsubstantiated charges, and highlights the need for reform in systems that fail to recognize wrongful convictions and protect individuals with strong ties to the U.S.",
