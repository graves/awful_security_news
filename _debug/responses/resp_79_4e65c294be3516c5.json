  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks and record-breaking performances. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit after the first three quarters, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so, thanks to a heroic performance by second-year quarterback Bo Nix. Meanwhile, New England Patriots’ Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of his passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush over 50 yards in a single game. On the flip side, poor performances led to mid-game quarterback benchings: Tua Tagovailoa was benched by the Miami Dolphins after three interceptions, and Justin Fields was replaced by Tyrod Taylor by the Jets after a weak first half. The Green Bay Packers also secured a late victory over the Cardinals, with defensive standout Micah Parsons disrupting the final drive. Overall, the week highlighted the unpredictable nature of the NFL, with multiple teams experiencing dramatic shifts in momentum and leadership.",
