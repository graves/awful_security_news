  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists are reevaluating the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While earlier evidence favored pulsars due to the glow's shape matching the galactic bulge, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter — specifically, a squashed, egg-shaped distribution — could also produce this pattern. The results suggest a 50% chance the glow stems from dark matter, though no direct detection has been made. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to confirm or reject the dark matter hypothesis. This work reinforces the long-standing scientific quest to identify dark matter, particularly through WIMPs, which remain a leading candidate despite decades of failed direct detection. The discovery would be a breakthrough in physics, potentially solving one of the century-old mysteries of the universe.",
