  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has officially relinquished his title as Duke of York and all other royal honors, effectively ending his public role in the British royal family. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles III and Prince William, follows years of controversy stemming from allegations of his connection with Jeffrey Epstein, including being named as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet. Renewed scrutiny from a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre and allegations involving a Chinese national, Yang Tengbo, have intensified pressure on the royal family. Though Andrew retains the title 'Prince,' the loss of the dukedom marks a definitive step away from public life and royal events. Experts say this move reflects a growing belief that Andrew has become 'toxic' to the royal brand, though critics argue it is too little, too late to repair the damage to the monarchy’s reputation.",
