  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize, awarded to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough with implications for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. The article highlights the historical roots of the Nobel Prizes, established by Alfred Nobel in 1895, and the institutional bodies responsible for each prize. It also underscores the political controversy surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s public claims about deserving the Peace Prize, which experts dismiss as inconsistent with the Nobel Committee’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts. The article references previous winners and their groundbreaking work, such as the 2024 Medicine Prize for microRNA discovery, the 2024 Physics Prize for AI and neural networks, the 2024 Chemistry Prize for protein prediction via AlphaFold, the 2024 Literature Prize for Han Kang, and the 2024 Peace Prize for Nihon Hidankyo. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of academic integrity and the global significance of the Nobel Prizes in recognizing transformative human achievements, even amid political and societal tensions.",
