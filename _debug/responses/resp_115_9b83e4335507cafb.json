  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify their nest structures in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants exhibit social distancing behaviors—infected workers self-isolate and nurses increase distance from foragers—while also building more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and spaced entrances. These architectural changes reduce disease transmission and work in tandem with social behaviors to protect the colony. The research, conducted by Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie and published in the journal Science, represents the first demonstration of a non-human social species actively altering its environment in response to disease threats. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest these principles could inspire human-designed public spaces that use spatial planning to reduce disease spread, offering a form of 'architectural immunity' inspired by ant societies.",
