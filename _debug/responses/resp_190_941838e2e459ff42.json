  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The implementation of new U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture has added significant cost pressure to the already fragile housing market. Homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera have seen their budgets balloon due to rising material prices, while companies such as RH and IKEA face financial strain and potential price increases. Experts including Peter Harrell, Buddy Hughes, and Elena Patel warn that these tariffs—building on prior measures like steel and copper tariffs—exacerbate inflationary pressures, reduce affordability, and threaten low-margin affordable housing development. Despite not being a standalone catastrophe, the cumulative effect of these tariffs increases construction and renovation costs, creates cost uncertainty, and dampens consumer confidence in home purchases, particularly in the context of high mortgage rates and an already weak market.",
