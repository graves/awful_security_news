  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, claiming the prosecution is a politically motivated vendetta by President Donald Trump. His attorneys argue that Trump’s personal attacks on Comey and his appointment of White House adviser Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney—after the 120-day limit for such appointments expired—violates constitutional procedures and circumvents Senate confirmation requirements. The defense also cites a prior case involving Trump’s own indictment, where a judge dismissed charges due to an unconstitutional appointment, as precedent. Comey’s lawyers assert that the case constitutes an abuse of power and retaliation for protected speech, and request that Judge Michael Nachmanoff dismiss the charges on grounds of vindictiveness and illegitimacy of prosecutorial authority.",
