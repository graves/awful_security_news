  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of its full-scale invasion, Russia launched a devastating assault on Ukraine's Chernihiv region, using over 100 Iranian-designed Shahed drones and six ballistic missiles to destroy power generation facilities. This attack caused a total blackout affecting hundreds of thousands, killed four people, injured ten (including a 10-year-old girl), and disrupted water supplies. The regional military administration confirms a pattern of increasing attacks on civilian infrastructure—such as petrol stations—over the past six months, indicating a shift in Russian strategy from front-line combat to targeting civilian populations. Ukrainian officials believe such strikes are not militarily effective but are designed to demoralize the population. Despite severe damage, public morale remains high, with residents maintaining daily life using backup generators and mutual support. Ukraine’s energy sector faces long-term challenges due to slow production and replacement times, with a single transformer taking over a year to produce. The country is seeking international support, especially from the United States, where recent energy-sector cooperation talks have been successful in advancing resilience efforts. This incident underscores the growing threat to civilian infrastructure and the psychological and economic toll of sustained attacks in Ukraine's northern regions.",
