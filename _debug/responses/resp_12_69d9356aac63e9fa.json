  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s authority to represent James Comey, claiming that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies the allegations, asserting that the memos in question were initially unclassified and that the government later classified them. He also notes that Comey sought legal advice after being fired by the Trump administration in May 2017, citing a prior inspector general report that found no evidence of classified information leaks. The dispute raises significant ethical and legal concerns about conflict of interest, especially since a person cannot be both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case. Experts emphasize the sensitivity of such issues in politically charged legal cases involving classified communications.",
