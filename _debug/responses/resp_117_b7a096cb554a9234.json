  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approached, multiple institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth—rejected the proposal. The Compact, which would have required schools to bar transgender students from using restrooms or playing in gender-affirming sports, freeze tuition, limit international enrollment, and mandate standardized tests, faced strong opposition from academic leaders who argued it contradicts core principles of scientific merit, research integrity, and academic freedom. Despite a White House meeting with several universities, the resistance remained robust, with institutions asserting that political conditions on federal funding threaten the legitimacy and independence of higher education. This backlash reflects broader tensions between federal policy and institutional autonomy, especially in the context of research funding and campus diversity.",
