  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicholas Rossi, 38, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008 and sentenced to between five years and life in prison after being identified through a DNA match from a decade-old rape kit. He faked his death in 2020, claiming he died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and used multiple aliases—including Arthur Knight—to evade capture. Authorities in Rhode Island and Scotland raised concerns about his identity, and he was arrested in Scotland in 2023 after his tattoos were recognized from an Interpol notice. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024, where he faced sentencing after a trial in which his accuser and parents testified. A judge described him as a 'flight risk' and 'serial abuser,' and he maintained his innocence during sentencing. The case underscores the dangers of sexual predators evading justice through deception and the importance of DNA testing and international cooperation in solving long-standing crimes.",
