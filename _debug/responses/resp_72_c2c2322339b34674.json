  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Admiral Alvin Holsey, who led US Southern Command from November 2024 to his retirement on December 12, 2025, is stepping down amid tensions with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the pace and legality of military operations targeting drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The article highlights a series of recent US military actions, including a fifth known strike on a drug-trafficking boat off Venezuela’s coast, killing six people, and the deployment of B-52 bombers in the region. These actions are further supported by President Donald Trump’s public authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela to curb drug and migrant flows. While Pentagon officials deny Holsey raised legal concerns, internal sources suggest he believed operations were too slow and lacked transparency, leading to a formal resignation offer at a Pentagon meeting on October 6, 2025, which was deferred. Holsey, with 37 years of military service, emphasized the enduring contributions of the SOUTHCOM team and the mission's role in defending national interests. His departure marks a leadership transition within a command facing growing scrutiny over the legality and scope of its counter-narcotics operations.",
