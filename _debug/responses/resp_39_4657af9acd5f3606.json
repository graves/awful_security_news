    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has confirmed the presence of its first wild mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — found in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík.",
    "The discovery marks the first known occurrence of mosquitoes in the natural environment of Iceland, unlike a previous isolated finding in a plane at Keflavík Airport.",
    "Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia, and is adapted to cold climates by surviving winter in sheltered areas.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquitoes may have arrived via ships or containers, though their exact origin remains unknown.",
    "While climate change may have contributed to warmer conditions allowing mosquitoes to survive, scientists remain cautious about directly attributing the discovery to climate change, noting that mosquitoes have been found in other northern regions and that the full impact of warming on mosquito ranges is still uncertain.",
    "Experts emphasize the need for further monitoring in spring to determine whether the species can survive winter and establish a permanent population in Iceland."
