  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Orange juice prices in the UK have surged by 134% since 2020, driven by a combination of climate-related crop failures, disease (citrus greening), over-reliance on single suppliers like Brazil and Florida, trade tensions, and new packaging regulations. The price spike is not isolated—beef, butter, chocolate, and milk have also seen significant increases. In response, manufacturers are replacing oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins and mangoes. While Brazil's harvest has slightly improved, global demand has declined due to health concerns and shifting consumer tastes. The UK remains highly dependent on imported food, making it vulnerable to global shocks. Experts suggest that retailers may have delayed passing on costs, leading to a delayed price recovery. Long-term solutions include AI-driven research into citrus greening and structural reforms in supply chains. The article concludes that this may be just the beginning of sustained food price volatility due to climate change and supply chain fragility.",
