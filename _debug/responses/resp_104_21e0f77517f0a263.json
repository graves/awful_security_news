    "Common injury mechanisms include being struck by the ball, paddle, or falling due to the fast-paced and small-court nature of the game.",
    "Standardized eye protection guidelines are recommended to reduce injuries by up to 90%, similar to those implemented in squash.",
    "Players are often unaware of the risks, and lack of awareness is a major reason for non-compliance with eye protection.",
    "Eye protection should meet the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F3164 standard and be made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate for optimal safety.",
    "Current eye protection options range widely in price ($10 to $160), making informed purchasing difficult for average players.",
    "Promoting standardized guidelines, posting them at courts, and encouraging professional athletes to model safe behavior can improve adoption."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pickleball, which has grown to nearly 20 million players in the U.S., is associated with a sharp rise in eye injuries—up 405 cases per year from 2021 to 2024. The study published in JAMA Ophthalmology reveals that 70% of injuries occur in adults aged 50 or older, challenging assumptions about youth risk. Injuries stem from being struck by the ball or paddle or from falls due to the game’s fast pace and compact court. Experts, including lead author Dr. Corey Lacher and researcher Dr. Daniel Henick, emphasize that standardized eye protection guidelines—especially those meeting ASTM F3164 and using shatter-resistant polycarbonate—are needed. A major barrier to adoption is player unawareness of risks, and current market confusion over pricing and quality makes selection difficult. Experts recommend posting guidelines at courts, making equipment more user-friendly, and encouraging professional players to model safe behavior to reduce preventable injuries.",
