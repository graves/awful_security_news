  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) after landing from Dubai at approximately 3:50 a.m. local time. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact and collided with an airport security patrol car, killing two staff members. Despite no distress signals from the pilots, the aircraft was left partially submerged with significant structural damage, and all four crew members were treated and released. The airport suspended operations on its north runway for safety and removal efforts, though other runways remain operational. The flight was under an Emirates flight number, but the aircraft was wet-leased from ACT Airlines, which provides cargo capacity to major carriers. This incident marks a rare but serious event at one of the world’s busiest and safest airports, with historical context from a 1999 crash at the same airport providing a backdrop of aviation risk at HKIA.",
