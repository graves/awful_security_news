  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global appeal to improve early-warning systems for extreme weather, emphasizing that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities. The WMO reports that over 2 million people have died from weather-related disasters in the past 50 years, with 90% of deaths occurring in developing nations. Despite progress—such as an increase in countries using multi-hazard early warning systems from 52 to 108—many regions still have only basic or no capacity, especially in fragile and conflict-affected areas. The article highlights real-world examples, including the 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland that led to the evacuation of the village of Blatten, and severe weather disasters in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and the US, illustrating the global scale and urgency of climate-driven risks. The WMO stresses that early warnings must empower communities to act, and that climate change is intensifying weather events, making proactive preparedness essential for global safety.",
