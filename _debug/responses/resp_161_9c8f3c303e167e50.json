    "The White House’s East Wing is undergoing massive demolition and reconstruction to build a new ballroom, marking the first structural change since 1948 and the first under President Donald Trump.",
    "The new ballroom is estimated to cost $250 million, though earlier reports cited $200 million; Trump claims the cost will be privately funded by himself and private donors, with no taxpayer burden.",
    "The ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet (8,360 m²), capable of seating up to 999 people, significantly expanding the capacity for state dinners and large gatherings compared to the current East Room (which seats ~200).",
    "The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and used since 1977 to house the first lady’s offices and visitor entrance, is being redeveloped while preserving the main White House structure and underground emergency bunker.",
    "Despite not being formally approved by the National Capital Planning Commission (due to a nationwide government shutdown), the project has proceeded, raising questions about oversight and federal policy processes.",
    "The project is being led by Washington-based McCrery Architects, with construction by Virginia-based Clark Construction and engineering by Dallas-based AECOM.",
    "Trump has emphasized that the new ballroom will not interfere with the main White House building, will not tear down existing structures, and will be built adjacent to it, showing respect for historic integrity.",
    "This project reflects a long-standing presidential desire for a dedicated ballroom space, with Trump claiming he is the first president to finally achieve this after more than 150 years of unfulfilled dreams."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated a major renovation of the White House’s East Wing to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, marking the first structural change to the building since 1948. The project, estimated at $250 million and privately funded, began in early October 2025 despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission due to a government shutdown. The new ballroom, capable of hosting up to 999 guests, is intended to fulfill a long-standing presidential dream of having a dedicated space for state dinners and high-profile gatherings, currently held on the lawn. While Trump insists the project will not impact the main White House or tear down existing structures, concerns remain about oversight, historical integrity, and the precedent of bypassing federal planning procedures. The effort, led by McCrery Architects, Clark Construction, and AECOM, will be completed before Trump’s term ends in 2029, with temporary relocation of offices and continued preservation of key historical features like the underground bunker and first lady’s offices.",
