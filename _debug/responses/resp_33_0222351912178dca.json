  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by Portugal's Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable used in the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet the safety specifications set by its operator, CARRIS. The cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, leading to a derailment, with at least 16 fatalities and multiple injuries. Eyewitnesses described the event as chaotic, with one man named Bruno reporting the car appearing out of control and producing a loud bang and brown smoke. Maintenance records were found to be falsified, with tasks marked as complete despite not being performed, and the maintenance plan falsely declared compliant. The interim findings are not conclusive, and a final report is expected next year.",
