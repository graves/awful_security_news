  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A government shutdown in the United States has lasted for three weeks and remains unresolved as of October 21, 2025, with no agreement between Democrats and Republicans. The shutdown has led to widespread furloughs and firings of federal workers, including key personnel at the National Nuclear Security Administration and air traffic control, and threatens the expiry of critical nutrition support for 42 million Americans. Democrats are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies to prevent soaring health insurance costs, framing the shutdown as a political failure to provide affordable care. Republicans, however, refuse to negotiate on subsidies until the government reopens and are attempting to reform the ACA instead, citing waste and fraud. Internal political dynamics are strained, with House Speaker Mike Johnson blocking House operations and refusing to swear in a new Democratic member, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s stopgap funding bill has been repeatedly blocked. Trump’s selective funding of military and FBI personnel fails to resolve broader issues. Despite public protests like 'No Kings' targeting him, both parties remain entrenched in blame and intransigence, with no sign of bipartisan compromise or a political breakthrough to end the impasse.",
