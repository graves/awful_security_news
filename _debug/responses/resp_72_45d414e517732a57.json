  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sean Grayson, a sheriff’s deputy in Illinois, is on trial for the 2024 murder of Sonya Massey, a Black woman who was shot in her home after police responded to a call about a suspected prowler. Body camera footage shows Grayson confronted her over a pan of hot water, interpreted her actions as a threat, and fired three times. Massey had a history of mental health issues and had recently sought treatment; Grayson was unaware of this. The incident sparked national outrage, prompting a change in Illinois law requiring full background transparency for all law enforcement candidates. The trial was moved from Springfield to Peoria due to heightened attention and security concerns. Key questions remain about whether Grayson’s use of force was justified and whether systemic failures in hiring and training contributed to the tragedy.",
