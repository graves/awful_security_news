This political shift led to significant changes in policy direction, with new initiatives launched in economic and security sectors. The new legislative session, which began on April 1, provided a platform for discussing key policy issues. The national budget, announced on March 15, and the national security strategy, released on March 10, set the foundation for these developments. The article highlights the importance of mid-year and end-of-year assessments in evaluating policy effectiveness, with critical timelines extending from January to June and July to December 2023. Key figures such as President Ahmed Farid and Minister of Finance Fatima Ali are central to these developments.","tags":["Politics","Government","Policy","Budget","Security Strategy","Cabinet Formation","Legislative Session","National Security","Economic Policy"],"timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"New Cabinet Formation and Policy Initiatives in 2023: A Political Overview"}
