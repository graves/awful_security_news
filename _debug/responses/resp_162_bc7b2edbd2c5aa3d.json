  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris has been targeted by a new heist in 2025, where robbers stole eight Napoleonic pieces of jewellery in a four-minute break-in using a truck-mounted ladder and angle grinder. This marks a shift from previous high-profile thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist, which was driven by cultural significance, to a more financially motivated theft involving high intrinsic value. Unlike paintings, which are valued for cultural heritage, jewellery can be dismantled, recut, and resold, making recovery extremely difficult. The theft is distinct due to the material value and recyclability of the stolen items, which may have been sold or broken down within hours. Historical context includes the 1940 Nazi looting attempt, which was averted by the relocation of artworks under Jacques Jaujard’s leadership, and earlier thefts such as in 1966 and 1990, which show a pattern of vulnerability across time. Experts like Noah Charney emphasize that recovery is only possible if a high reward is offered for the return of intact jewellery. The incident underscores the evolving threat of modern art theft and the urgent need for improved security and international cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.",
