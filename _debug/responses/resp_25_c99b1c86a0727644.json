  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Arye Zalmanovich, the oldest hostage taken by Hamas during the October 7, 2023 attacks, was returned to Israel on October 22, 2025, along with that of Tamir Adar, a farmer and educator who died defending his community. Both men were from Kibbutz Nir Oz and had strong ties to agriculture and community. Their return is part of Hamas's compliance with the U.S.-proposed ceasefire agreement, which requires the return of all deceased hostages within 72 hours. However, Hamas has not returned all bodies, and some remain missing or buried under rubble. The Israeli government, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed deep sorrow, while U.S. Vice President JD Vance emphasized the difficulty and long-term nature of recovery, stating that it will not happen overnight. This development reflects broader challenges in recovering human remains and the ongoing political and humanitarian implications of the conflict.",
