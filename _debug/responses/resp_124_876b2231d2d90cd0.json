  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy entered La Santé prison in Paris on October 21, 2025, to begin serving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy related to allegedly using his position as interior minister from 2005 to 2007 to finance his 2007 presidential campaign with funds from Libya, under the rule of Moammar Gadhafi. This marks the first time a former French leader has been imprisoned under modern conditions. Sarkozy is being held in solitary confinement, with limited contact and three weekly family visits. His legal team disputes the conviction and the decision to incarcerate him immediately, claiming he is innocent and that the case is politically motivated. The case has triggered widespread public support in France, with many viewing it as a violation of democratic norms. The justice system has faced criticism for potential political interference, especially as the current justice minister and other political figures are linked to the case, prompting warnings from top judicial officials about threats to judicial independence.",
