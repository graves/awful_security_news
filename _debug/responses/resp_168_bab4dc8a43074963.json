  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "AI-generated voice cloning technology has advanced to such a point that fake voices of public figures like Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto can be indistinguishable from real human voices, leading to a major fraud scam targeting wealthy Italian businessmen. The scam, which occurred in early February 2025, involved fraudulent calls where fraudsters used AI to impersonate Crosetto and requested large financial transfers, with only one individual, Massimo Moratti, actually sending money. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that voice clones were rated as equally realistic as real voices by participants and were often perceived as more trustworthy. The global rise in deepfake scams—exceeding $547 million in losses between January and June 2025—has prompted governments to act, with the US and Australia introducing legal bans on publishing AI-generated intimate images. While AI voice technology offers positive applications like restoring speech for those with voice impairments, its misuse in identity theft, misinformation, and illegal content production poses serious societal risks.",
