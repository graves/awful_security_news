  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to allegations that a 26-year-old asylum seeker, possibly of Romanian origin, sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl at the Citywest Hotel in southwest Dublin, hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters gathered and clashed violently with police, throwing bottles, launching fireworks, and setting a police van on fire. The protests, which echoed earlier violent anti-immigrant riots in 2023 and in Northern Ireland in June 2025, reflect a broader pattern of societal anxiety over immigration and public safety. Key figures including Minister for Justice Jim O’Callaghan and Prime Minister Michael Martin condemned the protests, labeling them as unacceptable and serious. The incidents underscore ongoing tensions in Ireland, where immigration-related crimes are being weaponized to fuel far-right mobilization, despite Ireland not having far-right parliamentary representation.",
