    "The phrase 'common sense' has been a central rhetorical device in American politics since the founding, originating with Thomas Paine in his 1776 pamphlet 'Common Sense'.",
    "President Donald Trump uses the phrase more frequently than any other political figure, especially in contexts where he challenges official reports or criticizes political opponents.",
    "Trump invokes 'common sense' to contrast with 'academic smarts' or 'ideological' positions, positioning himself as a man of ordinary, lived experience rather than elite knowledge.",
    "The phrase resonates strongly with rural voters, older demographics, and those who identify with the 'Make America Great Again' movement, as it evokes a simpler, more traditional past.",
    "While Democrats also use the phrase (e.g., Obama's gun reform, AOC's healthcare proposal), Trump's usage is more demagogic and often used to delegitimize opposition by framing it as irrational or outside mainstream understanding.",
    "Trump uses 'common sense' to justify controversial or norm-shattering policies, such as mass deployment of the National Guard into cities, which were previously unthinkable but are framed as logical, time-honored solutions.",
    "Scholars like Sophia Rosenfeld and Frank Luntz describe the phrase as potentially demagogic, suggesting that 'common sense' implies there is no other side to the debate — only 'nonsense' on the opposing side."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines how President Donald Trump has repeatedly used the phrase 'common sense' as a central political tool, framing his policies and criticisms of opponents as grounded in ordinary, lived experience rather than academic or elite perspectives. Rooted in Thomas Paine’s 1776 pamphlet, the phrase has long held populist appeal, but Trump's usage is described as more frequent and demagogic. He invokes it to justify controversial actions — such as advising against Tylenol for pregnant women and calling for National Guard deployment in cities — and to dismiss opposition as ideologically driven or 'dumb.' Experts like Sophia Rosenfeld and Frank Luntz note that the phrase resonates with rural and older voters and serves as a rhetorical cudgel, suggesting that the 'other side' is irrational or outside the mainstream. While Democrats have also used the phrase to signal broad appeal (e.g., Obama on gun reform, Ocasio-Cortez on healthcare), Trump’s use is uniquely tied to the MAGA movement and its emphasis on simplicity, tradition, and opposition to perceived political elites.",
