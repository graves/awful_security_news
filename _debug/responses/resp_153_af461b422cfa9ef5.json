  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A general strike in Gabes, Tunisia, on October 21, 2025, has brought the city to a standstill as tens of thousands protest against the environmental and health damage caused by the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents, led by the powerful UGTT labor union, blame the plant—operating since 1972—for widespread pollution, including gas poisoning, cancer, and marine ecosystem collapse. Over 200 people have been hospitalized, and activists claim that even local food has been poisoned. Despite a 2017 pledge to shut down the plant, authorities have instead increased production, calling phosphate vital to the national economy. President Kais Saied has framed the crisis as an 'environmental assassination,' while protesters demand immediate shutdown and accountability. In response, Chinese companies have been brought in to mitigate emissions, and the UGTT has declared plans for further mass protests.",
