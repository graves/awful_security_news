  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained in March 2025 after his activism at Columbia University sparked immigration enforcement actions. The government has sought to deport him, alleging that his presence has adverse foreign policy consequences and that he concealed work with UNRWA on immigration forms. A lower court in New Jersey ruled in favor of Khalil, releasing him from detention in a habeas corpus petition, which lawyers are now urging the US appeals court to uphold. The ACLU argues that the government’s use of immigration law to silence political speech is unconstitutional. A separate judge ruled the broader Trump administration crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists unlawful, violating free speech rights. The case remains ongoing, with both the habeas petition and the deportation process under appeal, highlighting a deep conflict between immigration policy and free expression.",
