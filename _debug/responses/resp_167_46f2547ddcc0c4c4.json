  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno state, farmers face extreme danger from Boko Haram and ISWAP militants, who have escalated attacks on agricultural workers, with killings rising sharply since 2024. Despite government efforts to reestablish farming communities through the Agro Rangers program—armed guards deployed to protect farmers—many still fear for their lives due to kidnappings, extortion, and violent assaults. The program is seen as a short-term and insufficient solution due to limited manpower and the militants’ ability to outmaneuver security forces. Farmers report that attacks have intensified in 2025, with over 4 million people facing food insecurity. While officials assert progress in restoring normalcy, critics including the International Crisis Group warn that rapid reintegration puts displaced people at greater risk. Personal testimonies from farmers like Aisha Isa, Mustapha Musa, and Baba Modu underscore the deep human cost of the conflict, which has persisted for over 15 years.",
