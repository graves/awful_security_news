  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has stated he may be seeking $230 million in compensation from the Justice Department for alleged wrongs committed during past investigations into him, including the Russia probe and the classified documents case. He claims these investigations violated his rights and that the DOJ under former President Joe Biden weaponized the justice system. The claims are filed through an administrative process, not a court case, and any settlement would come from taxpayer funds. Trump says he would give the money to charity or use it for White House renovations. Key DOJ officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Stanley Woodward, have previously represented Trump or his allies in these cases, raising ethical concerns. The Justice Department has fired its ethics chief in July 2024, part of a purge linked to investigations of Trump. While Trump denies seeking personal gain, the situation raises serious questions about conflicts of interest, institutional integrity, and the role of federal agencies in political accountability.",
