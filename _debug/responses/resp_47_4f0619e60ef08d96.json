  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald, James Comey’s lead defense attorney, over allegations that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Prosecutors claim that the memos Comey shared with his attorneys were classified at the time and that the disclosure violated ethical rules, potentially disqualifying Fitzgerald from representing Comey. However, Fitzgerald and his team counter that the memos were unclassified at the time of sharing and that a later upclassification does not retroactively change that fact. The dispute raises serious ethical questions about whether Fitzgerald, as a former witness in the case, can fairly serve as a defense lawyer. Legal experts emphasize that a person cannot be both a witness and a defense counsel in the same matter, making this a pivotal issue in the broader context of accountability and ethics in high-level political investigations.",
