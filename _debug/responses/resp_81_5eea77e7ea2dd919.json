  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically reserved for child nutrition — to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during a government shutdown caused by a lack of congressional spending authorization for fiscal year 2026. With WIC projected to run out of funds within a week or two, the White House, through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, proposed redirecting tariff revenue from Section 232 tariffs to keep the program operational. This move was praised by some as a necessary intervention, but criticized by experts and advocacy groups for lacking legal basis and transparency, with concerns about funding amounts, delivery timelines, and long-term viability. The decision has drawn bipartisan attention, especially from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who blamed Democrats for political obstruction. Despite the White House's claim of a 'creative solution,' legal and fiscal experts argue that Congress must authorize such a redirection, and WIC advocates stress that sustained funding is needed to prevent cuts and support growing enrollment amid inflation.",
