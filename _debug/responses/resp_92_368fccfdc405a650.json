  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of being an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro who overstayed his tourist visa, which expired in 2015. The arrest occurred during a targeted enforcement operation, and Bojovic is alleged to have lived in the U.S. illegally for over a decade. Despite local officials asserting that due diligence was conducted—including FBI and Illinois State Police background checks—DHS officials criticized the hiring of an individual who violated federal immigration laws, emphasizing that illegal aliens cannot legally possess firearms. The Hanover Park Police Department and Mayor Rodney Craig have stated that the hiring process was thorough and that Bojovic will be reinstated if he is found legally authorized to remain in the U.S. The case has ignited public debate over hiring practices in law enforcement, especially concerning immigration status, and is part of a broader pattern of federal enforcement targeting public sector employees with immigration violations, as seen in a similar case involving an Iowa school superintendent.",
