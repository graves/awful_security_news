    "A 155mm artillery shell fired during a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration over I-5 in California prematurely detonated, resulting in shell fragments damaging a California Highway Patrol cruiser.",
    "The incident occurred despite the Marine Corps claiming it was a safe practice, as shells were fired high over the highway, theoretically minimizing risk.",
    "The shell used came from a batch that had previously been successfully fired without issues the day before, raising concerns about consistency and quality control in production.",
    "California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the exercise as 'dangerous' and ordered the closure of I-5 prior to the firing, highlighting tensions between state safety concerns and military operations.",
    "The US has increased 155mm shell production from 2022 to over 40,000 rounds per month, with production shifts and quality issues noted in prior investigations, including cracked shells in Iowa and a change in explosives from TNT to a more stable compound that was later reverted.",
    "A retired Marine Corps colonel, Mark Cancian, noted that the premature detonation was abnormal and that the shell's fragments, though slow-moving, still posed a safety risk, especially to vehicles on the highway.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-fire demonstration for the US Marine Corps' 250th birthday at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell fired over the I-5 interstate prematurely detonated, sending fragments that damaged a California Highway Patrol vehicle. Though the Marine Corps claims such high-flying exercises are a safe, established practice, the incident is abnormal due to the shell’s premature explosion—despite previous successful firings the day before. The exercise had been criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called it dangerous and closed the highway beforehand. The shell's batch has been frozen and will not be reused until further investigation. The US has significantly increased production of 155mm shells since 2022 to support Ukraine's war effort, with prior investigations indicating manufacturing flaws and shifts in explosive composition that raised safety concerns. Experts, including retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian, emphasize that while high-flying shells are theoretically safe, the accidental detonation remains a serious safety breach.",
