    "The Nobel Prizes are among the most prestigious international awards, established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895 to recognize individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "The 2025 prizes follow a strict schedule: medicine (Oct 6), physics (Oct 7), chemistry (Oct 8), literature (Oct 9), peace (Oct 10), and economics (Oct 13).",
    "The prizes are awarded by distinct institutions: Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry, economics), Nobel Assembly (medicine), Swedish Academy (literature), and Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).",
    "Each laureate receives a gold medal, diploma, and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million).",
    "The nomination process is secretive; experts, past winners, and academics submit nominations by January 31, and decisions are kept confidential for 50 years.",
    "The 2024 winners include Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine), John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics), David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry), Han Kang (literature), Nihon Hidankyo (peace), and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (economics).",
    "The 2025 medicine prize goes to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, with implications for cancer and autoimmune disease treatment.",
    "The 2025 physics prize is expected to honor contributions to machine learning and artificial neural networks, building on prior work by Hopfield and Hinton.",
    "The 2025 chemistry prize is anticipated to recognize advances in protein structure prediction using computational models, building on AlphaFold’s success.",
    "The 2025 literature prize may honor a writer who addresses trauma and identity, similar to Han Kang’s 2024 win.",
    "The 2025 peace prize faces public controversy, with speculation about Donald Trump due to claims he 'ended seven wars,' though experts say eligibility is unlikely due to lack of focus on peace-building or institutional work.",
    "The Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes durable peace, institutional efforts, and academic freedom, with concerns raised about political interference from the Trump administration affecting scientific independence.",
    "The awards are formally presented in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, with global broadcasts and public ceremonies that reinforce the cultural and scientific significance of the prizes."
