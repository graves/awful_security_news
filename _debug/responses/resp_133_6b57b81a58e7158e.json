  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was previously approved in April 2025 but was postponed due to political pressure. Countries including China, the EU, Brazil, and Britain supported the initiative, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or abstained. The move undermines global efforts to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, with critics, including climate officials and the International Chamber of Shipping, warning that the delay hampers investment and decarbonization progress in the maritime sector.",
