  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rising electricity bills across the U.S., exemplified by a Kentucky nurse's $372 bill in August 2025, are being linked to the AI boom. As major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft invest billions in data centers—Meta at $17 billion and Microsoft at $24.2 billion—the demand for computing power has exploded. This surge is driving up national electricity consumption, with data centers projected to use 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Experts from the Department of Energy, Gartner, and Stanford say the power grid is unprepared for this scale of demand, leading to infrastructure strain and higher consumer prices. While some states like Oregon have introduced policies to require data centers to pay for grid strain, current pricing models do not account for AI-related demand, leaving homeowners to bear the financial burden. The article underscores a growing concern: AI-driven technological growth is not just a digital shift—it is a major force reshaping energy consumption and household budgets.",
