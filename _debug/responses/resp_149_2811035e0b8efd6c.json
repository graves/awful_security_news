  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major operation on October 21, 2025, Myanmar’s military arrested over 2,198 people at KK Park, a sprawling scam centre near the Thai border. The facility, spread across 250 buildings, was used for illegal gambling, money laundering, and online romance and investment scams. The raid uncovered 30 Starlink satellites, indicating the use of advanced technology to maintain internet access for criminal operations. Allegedly, top leaders of the Karen National Union were involved in the scam activities, linking armed conflict with organized crime. The operation comes amid rising international pressure from Thailand and China to curb such criminal networks, especially after the case of Chinese actor Wang Xing being trafficked and rescued. The scam centres exploit vulnerable individuals, many of whom are lured by false employment promises and forced into slave-like conditions. The U.S. Treasury has also taken action by sanctioning individuals and companies involved in these operations, highlighting the transnational nature of the issue.",
