  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, causing widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. The attacks, which have targeted the same areas repeatedly over the past month, are part of a strategy to terrorize the population and prolong the humanitarian crisis. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, respond with improved air defenses and retaliatory strikes on Russian facilities such as the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Zelensky is urging European allies to provide urgent military and financial aid, including the use of frozen Russian assets to fund air defense systems like the Patriot battery. Despite European proposals—such as a $163 billion loan—Russia denies the legality of asset seizure. The article also notes a pattern: when U.S. President Donald Trump becomes frustrated with Russia, Russian attacks increase, suggesting a strategic alignment between diplomatic shifts and military escalation. Zelensky remains cautious of a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, warning that it could be dominated by Russian influence and not lead to genuine peace.",
