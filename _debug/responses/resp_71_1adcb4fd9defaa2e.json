  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is escalating politically risky actions toward Venezuela, including deploying U.S. Navy forces and Air Force bombers near its coast and authorizing covert CIA operations, signaling possible regime change or military strikes. These actions are seen as part of a broader trend of militarized foreign policy under Trump, raising concerns about hubris and public backlash. Despite claims of drug-related threats, such assertions have been dismissed by intelligence officials. Public opinion remains skeptical of U.S. military intervention, with majorities of Americans believing the U.S. should stay out of foreign affairs and strongly opposing unilateral military action—suggesting significant domestic resistance if Trump proceeds with a full-scale intervention.",
