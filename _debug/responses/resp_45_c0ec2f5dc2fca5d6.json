  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable on the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet safety specifications and was not certified for passenger use, leading to a deadly crash in September 2025. The cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, resulting in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the event as sudden and catastrophic, with one car derailing and crashing into a building. The investigation revealed serious deficiencies in maintenance practices, including falsified completion records and a maintenance plan marked as compliant despite non-compliance. While the findings are preliminary, they highlight systemic failures in safety oversight by the operator, CARRIS, and underscore the need for stricter compliance with technical and operational standards.",
