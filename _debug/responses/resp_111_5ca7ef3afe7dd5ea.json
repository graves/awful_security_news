  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean would be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for detention and prosecution. The strike, part of at least six actions since early September, targeted a vessel reportedly loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics, resulting in the deaths of at least 29 people, including one more than previously reported. Trump framed the actions as part of an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, invoking legal precedents from the George W. Bush administration's war on terrorism. The repatriation avoids legal ambiguity about the status of the survivors in U.S. jurisdiction and reflects a broader policy shift toward military intervention in drug trafficking operations, particularly targeting well-known transit routes in the Caribbean.",
