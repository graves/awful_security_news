While some businesses report no immediate impact, others, like Mountain Mama in West Virginia, see reduced bookings. Tourists continue visiting parks like Grand Canyon and Yosemite, but without rangers, there are reports of illegal activities such as drone use and base jumping. In Washington, DC, closures of federal institutions like the Smithsonian have redirected tourist traffic to private museums, boosting their attendance. Advocacy groups are urging park closures to protect public safety and preserve park ecosystems, citing risks of trash buildup, emergency response delays, and unregulated behavior. The article underscores the complex trade-offs between accessibility and safety, and the economic dependence of local communities on national park tourism.",
