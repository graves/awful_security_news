  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank, banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from operating and de-registering major nongovernmental aid organizations (INGOs) based on ideological grounds. These measures, enforced through COGAT and requiring approval from a committee that includes Israeli government representatives, have led to the denial or rejection of re-registration for organizations such as the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a ceasefire agreement brokered by President Trump that promised increased aid, only two of seven border crossings remain open, with aid trucks often not classified as humanitarian. Aid groups claim the process is politically motivated, targeting organizations with critical perspectives on Israel, while Israel cites security concerns without providing evidence. UNRWA, which previously provided essential services such as food, shelter, and medical care in Gaza, continues to face blocked deliveries despite having food supplies sufficient to feed the population for three months. The U.S. cut funding to UNRWA in 2024, and while the EU has stepped in to partially cover the gap, humanitarian conditions remain dire.",
