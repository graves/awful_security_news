  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced stricter export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—expanding from seven previously restricted metals to include five new ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium)—and restricted access to refining equipment. The controls, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals and justify the use of products made from rare-earth metals, especially those with high concentrations of heavy rare earths. China justifies these measures on national security grounds, citing evidence of foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes. The move is strategically timed just weeks before a high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting it is a calculated signal to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Given that the US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and that these metals are essential for defence systems like F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI technologies, the restrictions pose significant challenges to US industrial and military capabilities. Analysts from CSIS and the University of Montana interpret the action as a 'signalling manoeuvre' designed to widen the strategic gap between the two nations during a critical diplomatic window, while also underscoring the deep economic interdependence between the US and China, where restrictions could harm both economies due to interconnected supply chains.",
