  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Stephen Bryant, a 44-year-old inmate from South Carolina, has been sentenced to death for the 2004 killings of Willard 'TJ' Tietjen and two other men in Sumter County, where he was allegedly giving them rides and shooting them on rural roads. After stopping at Tietjen’s home, Bryant shot him multiple times, lit candles around his body, and wrote a taunt in blood — 'catch me if u can' — on a wall using a potholder made by Tietjen’s daughter. His defense claims he suffered from childhood sexual abuse and used drugs to cope, suggesting psychological trauma as a motive. The state Supreme Court denied a delay request due to a government shutdown, and Bryant will be executed on November 14, 2025, making him the 50th person executed in South Carolina since 1985 and the seventh inmate executed in under 14 months after the state reopened its death chamber. The execution method — lethal injection, firing squad, or electric chair — will be chosen by Bryant by October 31. Critics have raised concerns about the cruelty of execution methods, citing prolonged suffering in previous cases, including Mikal Mahdi's. The case reflects both the brutality of the crimes and the ongoing ethical debate over capital punishment in the U.S.",
