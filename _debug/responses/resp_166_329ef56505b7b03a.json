  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food deliveries to Gaza have increased following a US-brokered ceasefire but remain critically low at about 750 metric tonnes per day—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes. Only two border crossings—Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara—are currently operational, severely restricting access to aid. The WFP operates 26 distribution points, still far below its goal of 145. Humanitarian access is dependent on political agreements, including Hamas’s pledge to return captives’ bodies, which has been partially fulfilled. The Rafah crossing remains closed, and the WFP has no access to the main Salah al-Din Street in northern Gaza. As a result, many Palestinians are storing food due to fears of future supply disruptions, and current supplies are only sufficient for half a million people for two weeks.",
