Moynihan, who was previously sentenced to 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release, was released under a blanket pardon that also included over 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants. His arrest comes amid rising threats to lawmakers and a surge in threat assessments reported by Capitol Police, highlighting concerns that pardoned individuals with violent criminal histories may reoffend and pose a danger to public officials. The case raises important questions about the implications of executive pardons in cases involving political violence and the ongoing vulnerability of elected officials.",
