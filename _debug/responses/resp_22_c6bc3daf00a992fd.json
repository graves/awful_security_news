  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have rejected claims that FBI investigators wiretapped Republican members of Congress during the January 6 Capitol riot investigation, asserting that toll records collected between January 4 and 7, 2021, were legally obtained, narrowly tailored, and part of standard investigative procedures. The records, which do not include call content but track call duration and numbers, were used to examine whether President Trump or his allies attempted to contact senators to delay certification of the 2020 election results. Critics, including Senate Republicans, have accused the investigation of political weaponization, particularly given the timing and inclusion of records from GOP lawmakers. However, Smith’s legal team points out that such toll data collection has been used in other investigations—such as those involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez—as evidence that the practice is routine and not politically biased. The controversy was raised during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, where both Republican and Democratic leaders questioned the motives behind the indictments of Trump allies.",
