    "Russia has launched a coordinated and intensified campaign using hundreds of modified drones and missiles to attack Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly key power stations and natural gas delivery facilities.",
    "The attack on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 on October 10 involved 465 drones and 32 missiles, destroying critical energy systems and leaving the city without power and water for much of the day.",
    "Russia has modified its drones and missiles to fly at higher altitudes, dive sharply, and change flight paths via software, significantly reducing interception rates (from 37% in August to 6% in September).",
    "Ukraine’s energy infrastructure remains under severe threat due to inadequate protection measures, including corruption in procurement, such as inflated costs for anti-drone systems by up to 30%.",
    "Corruption allegations involving lawmakers, city officials, and National Guard personnel have undermined Ukraine’s ability to properly secure and modernize key energy installations.",
    "The strategic goal of Russia is to cripple Ukraine’s heating and power supply in the approaching winter, leveraging forecasted cold weather to leave civilians defenseless.",
    "Residents of Kyiv are preparing for long-term blackouts by purchasing power banks, battery-powered devices, and alternative energy sources like gas-powered grills and wood stoves.",
    "Despite efforts to import natural gas from Europe, Ukraine’s energy system is now operating at a critically low level, with engineers estimating that repairs will be difficult and slow."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified its campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, launching a coordinated and sophisticated attack on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 on October 10 using 465 drones and 32 missiles. The strike, part of a broader strategy since early 2022, targets power, heating, and natural gas systems to leave civilians defenseless during an expected harsh winter. Russian modifications to drones and missiles—enabling them to evade Western air defenses—have significantly reduced interception rates. Ukraine’s response has been hampered by corruption in procurement, such as inflated costs for anti-drone systems, and inadequate infrastructure protection, including the use of sandbags instead of undergrounding systems. As a result, residents are preparing for prolonged blackouts by using generators, batteries, and gas-powered appliances. Experts warn that Ukraine’s energy system is now at risk of collapse, posing a severe threat to public safety and winter survival.",
