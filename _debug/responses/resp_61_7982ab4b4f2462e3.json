    "Scientists have long been puzzled by a mysterious diffuse glow of gamma rays detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008.",
    "The glow has led to two main theories: one involving pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars), and another involving dark matter collisions, particularly Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).",
    "Traditional models of dark matter assumed a spherical distribution, but new computer simulations show the dark matter in the galactic center may have an egg-shaped (squashed) structure matching the observed glow’s shape, supporting the dark matter theory.",
    "A 50% chance is now estimated that the glow is due to dark matter, according to lead physicist Joseph Silk, making it a significant but not definitive possibility.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), starting operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively confirm or refute the dark matter origin of the glow.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter, this research strengthens the case that WIMPs could be responsible, maintaining their status as a leading theoretical candidate.",
    "The scientific community remains divided: some believe the simulation results are promising, while others argue the match is not strong enough to prove dark matter’s role.",
    "The mystery of dark matter remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in physics, with implications for understanding the composition and structure of the universe."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, has long baffled scientists. While the glow could be explained by pulsars — spinning remnants of dead stars — new computer simulations led by Joseph Silk suggest that dark matter, specifically WIMPs, could produce the same shape and intensity. These simulations reveal that dark matter in the galactic center may be squashed into an egg-like structure, matching the observed glow’s form. This gives the dark matter theory a 50% chance of being correct, though it remains unproven. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to definitively determine whether the glow stems from dark matter or pulsars. This research reignites hope that WIMPs — long the leading dark matter candidate — may be detectable in space, offering a potential path to solving one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics.",
