  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. is ending its 50+ year partnership with China by sending three giant pandas—Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji—back to China. This marks the end of a long-standing diplomatic initiative, known as 'panda diplomacy,' begun in 1972 during President Nixon’s visit to China. The program, which once included 15 pandas in the U.S. and spread to 23 countries, is now winding down due to deteriorating U.S.-China relations and shifting diplomatic priorities. China owns the pandas and charges zoos for their care, with the U.S. contributing millions over decades. With the end of programs in Atlanta, Scotland, and Australia, only Mexico City's Xin Xin remains in the Americas. While China says the program supports conservation and biodiversity, some in China view the pandas as a symbol of U.S. perceived dominance. Zoo staff remain hopeful for a future return, and the National Zoo is planning renovations to the vacant exhibit, with hopes that future U.S. leaders—like First Lady Jill Biden—may help revive the program.",
