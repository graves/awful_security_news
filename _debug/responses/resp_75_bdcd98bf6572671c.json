  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal widely seen as a diplomatic victory, President Donald Trump has not gained significant domestic support. Public opinion polls from AP-NORC and CNBC show that while Trump’s approval on Gaza slightly improved, overall disapproval remains high, especially on economic issues. Americans are deeply concerned about inflation, rising costs of living, and job security, with only a small fraction expecting economic improvement. These economic anxieties outweigh foreign policy achievements, and public sentiment suggests that people prioritize economic well-being over diplomatic milestones like a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. The fragility of the Gaza deal and past failures of similar peace initiatives further erode confidence, indicating that domestic political support for Trump remains weak due to economic concerns.",
