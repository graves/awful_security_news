  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers, as part of the Trump administration’s broader strategy to reduce asylum applications and carry out mass deportations. While Belize asserts it has safeguards including nationality restrictions, transfer caps, and national veto powers to ensure safety and uphold human rights, critics—including Belize’s opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton—argue that the country lacks the infrastructure and capacity to properly support asylum seekers. The deal is controversial due to concerns about human rights violations, lack of due process, and the potential for deportees to face abuse in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan, or El Salvador. Critics also warn that such agreements may violate international humanitarian law by allowing wealthy nations to evade their legal obligations. The agreement requires Senate approval in Belize and remains under political and legal scrutiny, with past deportation flights to countries like Guatemala and El Salvador raising alarms over safety and fairness.",
