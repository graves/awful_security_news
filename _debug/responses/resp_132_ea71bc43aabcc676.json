  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Los Angeles Angels have hired former major league catcher Kurt Suzuki as their new manager, marking the fifth full-time manager in the team's past eight seasons. Suzuki, who previously served as a special assistant to general manager Perry Minasian, brings experience as a player—including a World Series title with Washington and All-Star honors with Minnesota—and a personal connection to the organization. The hiring follows the collapse of talks with Albert Pujols, who had been a front-runner due to his long-standing ties to the Angels. Suzuki, a fourth-generation Japanese-American from Hawaii, is the first Hawaiian-born full-time manager in MLB history and joins Don Wakamatsu and Dave Roberts as a manager of Asian heritage. The Angels, currently facing 10 consecutive losing seasons and 11 non-playoff years, are seeking change amid public scrutiny from a wrongful death lawsuit involving pitcher Tyler Skaggs. Despite having a young core led by Mike Trout, Zach Neto, and Jo Adell, the team has shown little progress, making Suzuki’s appointment a pivotal step in their long-term recovery.",
