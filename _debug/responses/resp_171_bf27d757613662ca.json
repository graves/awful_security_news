  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil’s Amazon through its supply chain. The report focuses on Pará, the state with the highest deforestation rates, where cattle are raised illegally in protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. These animals are transported via a 'laundering' system using GTAs (animal transit permits), which only track group-level data and lack individual animal records. As a result, JBS cannot verify the origin of its cattle or ensure they were not sourced from illegal ranches. Despite past promises to trace suppliers, JBS failed to meet its 2011 commitment under the G4 Cattle Agreement. Environmental advocates argue that systemic reform—such as making GTA data publicly accessible and enforcing national traceability systems—is urgently needed. While Brazil’s federal and state governments have introduced traceability mandates (by 2026 for Pará and 2032 nationally), experts warn these timelines are too slow to prevent continued deforestation and harm to Indigenous communities and the environment.",
