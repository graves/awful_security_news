  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s leadership, under President Xi Jinping, is convening the fourth plenum to finalize its next five-year economic plan (2026–2030), emphasizing technological self-reliance in AI, quantum computing, new energy, and biotechnology amid growing trade tensions with the United States. This meeting comes at a critical time as China faces slowing economic growth, overcapacity, deflation, and a property crisis, while also dealing with a sweeping anti-corruption purge within the military and political leadership. The removal of high-ranking officials such as General He Weidong and Miao Hua signals Xi’s tightening grip on power, with potential reshuffles in the Central Committee and Central Military Commission. While the overall direction of the strategy is expected to remain consistent, analysts suggest possible adjustments to boost domestic consumption and address overproduction. Global observers are closely watching these developments as they reveal the internal dynamics of China’s authoritarian governance and its evolving strategic response to international competition.",
