  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a high-intensity Thursday Night Football matchup dubbed the 'Icy Hot Bowl' by Steelers teammate Cameron Heyward, 40-year-old Joe Flacco outperformed 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in a dramatic 33-31 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Flacco, acquired to replace injured Joe Burrow and struggling Jake Browning, delivered a masterful performance with 342 yards and three touchdowns, including a crucial final drive that culminated in a winning field goal by Evan McPherson. The Bengals overcame a 10-0 second-quarter lead by Pittsburgh, who had Rodgers throw four touchdowns and pass Ben Roethlisberger to move into fifth place on the NFL’s all-time passing yards list. Despite the loss, Rodgers’ historic milestone and the resilience of both veterans underscore the continued relevance of elder statesmen in the NFL, proving that age and experience can still yield elite performances in the modern game.",
