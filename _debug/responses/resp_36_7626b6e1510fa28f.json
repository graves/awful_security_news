  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Washington to request Tomahawk cruise missiles for targeted strikes on Russian energy facilities, believing they would weaken Russia’s war economy. However, during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Trump denied the delivery of the missiles, citing U.S. strategic needs and calling for both Ukraine and Russia to immediately cease hostilities and accept current battle lines. Trump also reportedly communicated this message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who argued that the missiles would not affect the battlefield but could damage US-Russia relations. Zelensky proposed a trade of Ukrainian drones for the missiles, but the proposal was not accepted. Trump has previously taken conflicting positions on territorial concessions, shifting from support for land swaps to believing Ukraine could reclaim all occupied territory. European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, reinforcing international solidarity amid the ongoing conflict.",
