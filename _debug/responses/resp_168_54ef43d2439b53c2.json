    "The world will experience 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100 due to climate change, even under current Paris Agreement commitments.",
    "The number of superhot days is defined as warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991 to 2020, indicating a severe threshold of heat danger.",
    "Before the Paris Climate Agreement, warming was projected at 4°C, leading to 114 extra superhot days annually; now, at 2.6°C, it is 57 extra days, half the worst-case scenario.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days annually, showing the accelerating impact of climate change.",
    "Small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest increases in dangerous heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra superhot days annually.",
    "These 10 high-impact nations produce only 1% of global carbon emissions, highlighting a severe climate injustice.",
    "In contrast, top carbon polluters—United States, China, and India—face only 23–30 extra superhot days, despite contributing 42% of global CO₂ emissions.",
    "This disproportionate heat exposure creates a growing inequality between rich and poor nations, potentially fueling geopolitical instability.",
    "Experts like Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto emphasize that even under current efforts, climate change remains catastrophic and affects millions of people annually.",
    "The study, by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, is not peer-reviewed but uses established climate attribution methods and underscores the real-world consequences of warming."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current Paris Climate Agreement commitments, the planet will face an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—compared to the 114 days projected under pre-2015 warming trajectories. The report defines superhot days as being warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991 to 2020. While global warming has already added 11 such days since 2015, the study highlights a stark climate injustice: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—accounting for just 1% of global emissions—will face the largest increases in dangerous heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days. In contrast, major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts such as Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto warn that climate change remains catastrophic and will affect millions, while Andrew Weaver emphasizes that such disparities may deepen global inequalities and threaten geopolitical stability.",
