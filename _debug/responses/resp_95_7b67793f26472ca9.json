    "The Justice Department brought its first federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s Antifa crackdown, accusing two individuals—Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (known as Autumn Hill)—of participating in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility in Fort Worth, Texas.",
    "Prosecutors allege that Evetts and Arnold were part of an 'Antifa Cell' that used vandalism and fireworks to draw law enforcement away, enabling two shooters to open fire on a police officer who responded to the incident.",
    "The attack occurred on July 4, when a group of individuals set off fireworks and spray-painted nearby structures; shortly after, one shooter fatally wounded a correctional officer in the neck and another fired 20 to 30 rounds before fleeing.",
    "Ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song was charged with attempted murder and is alleged to have purchased the rifles used in the attack, including one with a binary trigger allowing two bullets per trigger pull.",

    "The indictment describes Antifa as a 'militant enterprise' made up of networks of individuals and small groups who espouse insurrection and propose violent attacks on the U.S. government.",
    "Trump designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization last month, and this case marks a significant step in defining Antifa legally as a terrorist entity despite its status as an ideology rather than a formal organization."

Prosecutors allege the group, described as an 'Antifa Cell,' used vandalism and fireworks to draw law enforcement away, enabling two shooters to fire on a responding police officer, one of whom was wounded. The attack, which occurred on July 4, 2025, was preceded by detailed planning via group chats, including map-sharing and weapon discussions. Ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song is charged with purchasing and supplying the firearms used, including one with a binary trigger. The case marks a pivotal moment in defining Antifa as a 'militant enterprise' capable of insurrection and violence, a legal characterization that follows President Trump’s designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.",
