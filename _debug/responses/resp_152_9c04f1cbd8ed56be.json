  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of drone attacks, including multiple blasts near Khartoum international airport just one day before its long-awaited reopening, have raised serious concerns about the safety of Sudan’s recovery efforts. The attacks, attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), involve suicide drones and mark the third such incident in seven days. Despite the Sudanese army reclaiming control of Khartoum in 2023 and launching a reconstruction campaign, drone strikes continue, targeting both military installations and civilian infrastructure. These attacks threaten the resumption of domestic flights by the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority, and the broader conflict — now involving the RSF’s attempt to seize el-Fasher in Darfur — risks escalating into large-scale ethnic violence. The wider war has killed tens of thousands, displaced over 12 million people, and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises, with international bodies like the United Nations warning of further atrocities if the RSF succeeds.",
