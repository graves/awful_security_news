Artistic elements, including those by Leandro Ehrlich, are designed to become hidden beneath coral growth, symbolizing the integration of art and nature. The project not only restores ecological balance but also creates a unique, accessible ecotourism destination visible from the air and accessible to divers in shallow water.",
