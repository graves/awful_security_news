In response, officials including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin have announced major renovation plans, with a proposed $834 million investment to upgrade security, climate control, and visitor management. The article emphasizes how the Louvre’s historical significance and cultural value make it a prime target, and how repeated breaches have exposed long-standing institutional weaknesses."
