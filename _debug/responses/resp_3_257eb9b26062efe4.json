  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The oldest hostage taken by Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attacks, Arye Zalmanovich, aged 85, is among the two deceased hostages returned to Israel on October 21, 2025. His death in captivity on November 17, 2023, makes him a symbol of the extreme age and vulnerability of hostages. Tamir Adar, a 38-year-old defender of Kibbutz Nir Oz who died on October 7, 2023, is also among the returned remains. The bodies were transferred under the Trump administrationâ€™s ceasefire agreement, which requires Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours of the deal's implementation. However, Hamas has stated that significant efforts and equipment are needed to recover bodies buried under rubble, and one previously returned body was misidentified. The IDF is conducting forensic identification at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, and the U.S. Vice President, JD Vance, emphasized the importance of returning bodies to families while acknowledging the difficulty of the task. This development marks the 14th and 15th deceased hostages to be returned since the ceasefire deal, but challenges remain in fully fulfilling the agreement due to logistical and operational constraints.",
