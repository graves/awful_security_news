  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has endured its first major test after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, prompting airstrikes and accusations of violations from both sides. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched strikes across Gaza, accusing Hamas of attacking Israeli forces in Rafah with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire, while Hamas denied involvement and claimed it was targeting Israel-backed militias. The Al-Qassam Brigades (AQB) affirmed their commitment to the ceasefire and reported finding another Israeli hostage. Despite the escalation, humanitarian aid deliveries were resumed, signaling a continued effort to uphold the peace deal, though the Rafah Crossing remains closed. Both parties continue to accuse each other of breaches, including delays in returning hostage bodies. Key US negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have arrived in the region, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with them ahead of a visit by US Vice President JD Vance. Internal clashes in Gaza, including a reported public execution, have intensified security tensions, and domestic political pressure—particularly from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir—criticizes the resumption of aid as a 'backdown.' The situation underscores the fragility of the ceasefire and the ongoing struggle to balance security, humanitarian needs, and political pressures.",
