Hamas has returned 13 of the 28 deceased bodies, all of which have been formally identified, including Sergeant Major Tal Haimi. However, Israeli intelligence believes Hamas may not be able to recover all the remaining bodies due to extensive rubble and logistical challenges. Hamas claims it requires special equipment and significant efforts to recover the missing remains. The Red Cross will take custody of the new remains, with public sensitivity advised until official identifications are completed. U.S. Vice President JD Vance affirmed that the recovery is a top priority but acknowledged it will take time, especially given that some bodies are buried under rubble and others may be untraceable. This development is part of a broader ceasefire effort that has been strained by mutual accusations of violations and ongoing operational difficulties.",
