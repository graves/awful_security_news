  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a highly organized seven-minute heist that occurred at 9:30 a.m. on October 19, 2025, thieves stole eight of nine high-value items from the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery, including a tiara, necklace, earrings, and a crown from Empress Eugénie. The robbers used a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder to force open a window, then fled on motorcycles. The museum remained closed as a security measure, and investigations have opened into organized crime and foreign involvement. Among the stolen items are royal artifacts from queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense and Empress Marie-Louise. The crown of Empress Eugénie was damaged in the process, and tools used in the attack were recovered. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, emphasized the cultural and historical significance of the stolen items, calling it an attack on national heritage. Experts warn that thieves may melt or recut items to extract value, risking irreversible loss. This is believed to be the first major robbery at the Louvre in over a century, drawing comparisons to the 1911 Mona Lisa theft.",
