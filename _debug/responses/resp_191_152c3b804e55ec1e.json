  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades through military force and fear, will relinquish control in the wake of a ceasefire agreed on 10 October 2025. Despite initial optimism from international actors like the U.S. under Donald Trump, the article reveals that Hamas has continued to carry out violent acts, including beatings, shootings, and impromptu executions of rivals, undermining the peace plan. The group's leadership has suffered major losses, including the assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, but it remains resilient through splintered cells and youth recruitment. Hamas maintains a vast network of underground tunnels, some of which are embedded within civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools. While some leaders, such as Dr. Ahmad Yousef, believe that a transition to civilian governance and disarmament is possible—possibly with international forces from Egypt and Turkey—others, like Dr. Michael Milshtein, argue that Hamas will remain dominant and that another war is likely within five years. The article questions whether Hamas will fully disarm or rebrand itself as a political entity, drawing parallels to the ANC's transformation in South Africa. Ultimately, it concludes that even if Hamas steps back from direct rule, it remains a deeply entrenched and influential force in Gaza, with significant military and ideological resilience.",
