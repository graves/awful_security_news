  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Poland has arrested eight individuals, including three Ukrainian nationals, suspected of planning and carrying out sabotage operations such as sending explosive packages to destabilize EU countries supporting Ukraine. These actions are part of a broader pattern of hybrid warfare allegedly orchestrated by Russia, which has been accused of using espionage, sabotage, and drone incursions across Europe since 2022. Authorities in Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, and the UK have all reported similar operations, indicating a transnational threat. The Polish government, under Prime Minister Donald Tusk, has responded by strengthening air defenses and investigating networks involving cross-border movements. Russia denies the accusations, calling them 'Russophobia', while the EU proposes coordinated measures like a 'drone wall' to counter rising threats. This reflects a growing security crisis in Europe, where non-military tactics are being used to undermine geopolitical stability.",
