Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that Ingrassia 'is not going to pass,' and at least one Republican senator, Rick Scott, has committed to voting against him. The controversy is amplified by Ingrassia’s ties to White nationalist Nick Fuentes and his promotion of conspiracy theories, including calls for martial law after the 2020 election. While Ingrassia’s legal team disputes the authenticity of the texts, claiming they are satirical or manipulated, Senate committee members are awaiting a confirmation hearing on Thursday to evaluate his fitness for office. The White House has not yet commented, and the nomination's fate now depends on whether it can secure Republican support amid mounting ethical and political concerns.",
