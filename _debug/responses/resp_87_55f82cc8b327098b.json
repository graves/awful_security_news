  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Electricity bills in the U.S. are rising due to a surge in energy demand driven by the AI boom. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Broadcom are investing billions in AI infrastructure, including custom chips and data centers, which consume vast amounts of electricity. Data centers are projected to use 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. Experts say this demand, combined with infrastructure strain from severe weather and electric heating, is pushing prices higher. While some states like Oregon are attempting to shift costs to data center operators, current pricing models do not fully reflect this strain, leaving residential consumers to bear the brunt of rising utility bills.",
