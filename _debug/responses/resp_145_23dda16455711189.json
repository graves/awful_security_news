  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to regulate shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the initiative. The framework, which would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax on ships emitting excess CO2, had already been approved in April 2025. Trump’s public threats on Truth Social, calling the plan a 'Global Green New Scam Tax,' prompted a shift in voting behavior, with 57 delegates supporting a delay over 49. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain maintained their backing, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or shifted their positions. Climate experts and the International Chamber of Shipping criticized the delay as a setback to climate action, stressing the need for clarity and investment in decarbonization. The decision undermines global efforts to reduce shipping’s contribution to climate change, especially as ocean weather patterns shift and shipping safety is threatened by extreme storms. Long-term solutions, such as ammonia and methanol fuels and special sails, remain under discussion.",
