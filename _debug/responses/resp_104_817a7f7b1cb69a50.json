  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hundreds of cancer survivors from across the U.S., including individuals from New York such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress during a citizen advocacy event organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Despite their differing political affiliations—Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing is a Democrat, and Manna is a self-described Reagan Republican—the volunteers transcended partisan divides, emphasizing that cancer does not care about political ideology. Their shared experience of surviving or being affected by cancer created a powerful bond, enabling them to focus on common goals: increased funding for cancer research, expanded access to screening, and support for ACA health insurance subsidies. Although the extension of subsidies remained controversial among Republican lawmakers, both parties supported research funding and screening initiatives. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, honoring 10,000 individuals affected by cancer. The story illustrates how personal health experiences can foster bipartisan cooperation in a politically divided environment.",
