    "The world will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 due to climate change, even with current Paris Agreement commitments.",
    "The number of superhot days is halved compared to the worst-case scenario of 4°C warming (114 days), but still represents a major climate risk.",
    "Small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face disproportionately large increases in dangerous heat days (e.g., Panama: 149 extra days), despite contributing only 1% of global carbon emissions.",
    "Large carbon emitters like the United States, China, and India—accounting for 42% of global CO2—will face only 23–30 extra superhot days, revealing a stark global inequity in climate impacts.",
    "The study underscores that climate change is not only a scientific issue but also a social and geopolitical one, with heat exposure being highly unequal and potentially driving instability between nations."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that even with current Paris Agreement commitments, the world will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat. This is half the increase from the worst-case scenario of 4°C warming, which would have added 114 such days. The findings show a sharp global inequity: small, ocean-based nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest increases in heat exposure—such as Panama’s 149 extra days—despite contributing only 1% of global emissions. In contrast, top emitters like the U.S., China, and India, responsible for 42% of CO2, face only 23–30 extra days. Experts stress that these disparities not only threaten public health but may also deepen geopolitical tensions, underscoring climate change as both a scientific and social crisis.",
