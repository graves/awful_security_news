  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is leveraging his deep background in branding and marketing — honed through his real estate business and political campaigns — to transform the U.S. federal government into a branded, marketable entity. This includes initiatives such as the TrumpRx drug website, the Trump Gold Card, a proposed Trump coin, a fighter jet named F-47, and a rebranded Rose Garden Club. These efforts, rooted in slogans like 'Make America Great Again' and inspired by successful corporate branding, aim to create a strong, memorable identity around the administration. However, critics argue that such actions violate longstanding norms of governmental neutrality and raise ethical concerns about commodifying public institutions. While the branding has increased agility in social media and public messaging, it has also led to controversy, such as AI-generated offensive content. The article highlights how Trump’s personal brand is now embedded across federal operations, signaling a shift in how political power and public institutions are perceived and promoted.",
