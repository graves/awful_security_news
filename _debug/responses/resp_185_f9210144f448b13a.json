The foundation, which controls 75% of voting rights despite owning only 28.1% of shares, pushed for a broader reconfiguration of leadership, rejecting the board's proposal to add new members with new skills. This leadership conflict follows previous changes, including the removal of CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen in May 2024 and a new CEO appointment in August. The company’s valuation, once the highest in Europe due to the popularity of its weight-loss drugs, has declined due to competition from rivals like Eli Lilly, and recent share price dips reflect investor concerns over governance and market competitiveness.",
