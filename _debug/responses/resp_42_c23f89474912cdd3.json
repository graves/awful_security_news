  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man, to five years to life in prison for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi, who had previously fled the U.S. and falsely claimed to have died in 2020, was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit and later arrested in Scotland via Interpol notice after hospital staff recognized his tattoos. The case highlights his pattern of deception, including using aliases such as Arthur Knight and falsely claiming to be an Irish orphan, as well as his history of evading justice in Rhode Island and facing fraud charges in Ohio. The victim described the abuse and financial coercion, and the judge emphasized Rossi's danger to public safety as a 'serial abuser and flight risk.' The case underscores the role of DNA backlogs, international cooperation, and the importance of accountability in sexual violence cases.",
