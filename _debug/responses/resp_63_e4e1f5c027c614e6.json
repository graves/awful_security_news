  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery across American culture in 2025, driven by political trends, celebrity culture, and media. It traces the roots of the cowboy myth to the 1880s Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and its later romanticization through Hollywood and political figures. While brands, TV shows, and celebrities promote the cowboy as a symbol of patriotism, hard work, and traditional values, the article emphasizes that this portrayal is a myth divorced from reality. Historically, cowboys were Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans, yet this diversity is largely ignored in mainstream narratives. Recent efforts by figures like Beyoncé and Gabriela Hasbun have begun to highlight Black cowboy culture, but the dominant cultural imagery still relies on whitewashed, idealized stereotypes. The trend reflects broader cultural and political movements, especially conservative politics and resistance to urban or liberal values, with the cowboy becoming a symbol of American identity, even if it is not historically or socially accurate.",
