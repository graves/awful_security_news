  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, has become the first French ex-leader to serve a prison sentence after being convicted of criminal association in a highly controversial campaign financing case involving secret funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Though he did not personally receive the money, he is accused of conspiring with aides Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, who arranged meetings with Libyan officials via intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine in 2005. Sarkozy has consistently maintained his innocence and is appealing the conviction, with the highest administrative court set to deliver a verdict in late November 2025. He is currently serving a five-year sentence at La Santé prison, where he is held in an isolation cell under strict conditions, including solitary confinement and limited contact with other inmates. The case has sparked widespread public and political debate, with President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin expressing support, while raising questions about justice, political accountability, and the treatment of former leaders in legal systems.",
