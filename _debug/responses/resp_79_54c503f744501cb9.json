  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, escalating diplomatic tensions following accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump that Colombian President Gustavo Petro promotes drug production. The move follows a prior recall in July when the U.S. recalled its ambassador to Bogotá. The conflict has intensified with U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, including missile attacks on vessels allegedly involved in drug trafficking, resulting in at least 30 deaths, some of whom are believed to be Colombian nationals. Colombia has accused the U.S. of targeting its citizens and committing acts of murder, while Trump has threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian exports. This reflects a broader crisis in bilateral relations rooted in drug policy, national sovereignty, and political accusations.",
