  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no immediate plans for a meeting. This comes after Trump initially suggested a summit within two weeks following a phone call, but subsequent diplomatic efforts — including a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov — revealed divergent positions on ending the war in Ukraine. Officials say that Lavrov, while loyal to Putin, is not involved in major decisions and thus does not drive meaningful progress. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date was ever set, so postponement is not possible. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserts that Russia’s reduced interest in diplomacy stems from the U.S. withholding long-range missile support for Ukraine, suggesting that such capabilities are essential to achieving peace. While no immediate summit is expected, future discussions between Rubio and Lavrov may take place at an ASEAN-led multilateral meeting.",
