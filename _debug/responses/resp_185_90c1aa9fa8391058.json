  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US Vice-President JD Vance and other senior US envoys have arrived in Israel to strengthen the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which began on 10 October 2025 following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. The ceasefire is under threat after a Hamas missile attack killed two Israeli soldiers, triggering Israeli air strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians and prompting fears the deal could collapse. US officials, including Trump, warn of severe consequences for Hamas if it violates the agreement, with Trump threatening to 'eradicate' the group. Key US envoys are pushing for negotiations on the next phase of a 20-point peace plan, including an interim Palestinian government, international stabilisation force, and Hamas disarmament. Israel insists that Hamas must return all deceased hostages before joining peace talks, while Hamas has returned 13 of 28 bodies so far. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid remains severely limited, with only two crossings (Kerem Shalom and Kissufim) functional, leading to serious food shortages—especially in northern Gaza—despite 6,700 tonnes of food delivered to feed nearly 500,000 people for two weeks. The UN's World Food Programme stresses that sustained ceasefire is vital to humanitarian access, and Israeli forces have temporarily halted aid deliveries amid violence, resuming them under international pressure.",
