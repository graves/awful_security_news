  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food deliveries to Gaza have increased slightly after the US-brokered ceasefire but remain critically short of the 2,000-tonne daily target, with only 750 metric tonnes entering daily through just two crossings — Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara. Despite expanding to 26 distribution points, the WFP still falls far short of its goal of 145. The Rafah crossing with Egypt remains closed, and the WFP has no access to the Salah al-Din Street, blocking aid to northern Gaza. Humanitarian aid is reaching only limited areas, and many Palestinians are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict. The article emphasizes that sustained ceasefire and full opening of crossings — including Rafah — are vital to preventing famine and saving lives in Gaza.",
