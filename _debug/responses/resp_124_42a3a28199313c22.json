    "The population growth is attributed to conservation efforts, including new management measures in Canada and protections from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglements.",
    "Despite progress, reproduction remains a challenge due to past injuries and underfeeding, though this year four mother whales gave birth and some had shorter intervals between calves.",
    "Only 11 calves were born in the past year, below researchers’ expectations, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging.",
    "Environmental groups warn that continued threats from ship strikes, entanglement, and weakening of marine protection laws could jeopardize recovery.",
    "The North Atlantic right whale is one of the rarest and most vulnerable whale species, historically hunted to near extinction, and remains at risk due to climate change-driven shifts in feeding patterns."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown signs of recovery, with an estimated 384 individuals in 2025—up from 376 in 2024. This modest growth follows a troubling 25% decline from 2010 to 2020 due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements. Scientists at the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute the current trend to conservation efforts, including new management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. Despite challenges like low reproduction rates and past injuries, four mother whales produced calves this year, and some had shorter breeding intervals, offering hope. However, only 11 calves were born, and experts remain cautious, emphasizing that sustained efforts and strong legal protections—such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act—are essential to avoid a reversal. Environmental groups warn that weakening of these laws puts the species at greater risk of extinction.",
