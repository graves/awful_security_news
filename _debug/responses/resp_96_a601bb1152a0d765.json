  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Electricity bills are rising across the U.S. due to a surge in demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Consumers like Lindsey Martin in Kentucky are seeing dramatic bill increases—from around $150 to over $370—mirroring a national trend. Experts point to the massive investments by tech giants such as OpenAI, Broadcom, Meta, and Microsoft in AI-powered data centers, which are consuming more electricity than ever. Data center electricity use is projected to rise from 4.4% of U.S. usage in 2023 to 6.7%–12% by 2028. This demand is outpacing the power grid’s ability to adapt, and current pricing models do not account for the strain caused by AI, leading to higher retail electricity costs. Some states, like Oregon, are attempting to address this by requiring data centers to pay directly for grid impact. The article underscores a critical energy challenge: the AI boom is fundamentally reshaping electricity consumption and pricing, raising urgent questions about infrastructure investment, equity, and sustainability.",
