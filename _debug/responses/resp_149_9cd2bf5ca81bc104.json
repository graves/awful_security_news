  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Doubts are growing over the likelihood of a swift summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. Both the Kremlin and the White House have stated there are no immediate plans for such a meeting, undermining Trump’s earlier claim that a summit could happen within two weeks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov maintains that Russia’s core demands—such as territorial concessions and Ukrainian neutrality—remain unchanged since their August Alaska summit, and has dismissed reports of a postponed meeting with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio as unscrupulous. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders accuse Russia of stalling peace efforts and continuing military aggression. Trump has instead proposed a ceasefire with frozen battle lines as a starting point, a position supported by Ukraine and Europe, but rejected by Putin. The apparent delay in diplomatic progress raises concerns about the feasibility of a lasting peace in Ukraine.",
