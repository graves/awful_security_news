  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which key online services—including banking, shopping, social media, and airline booking—became inaccessible for several hours. The root cause was identified as a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing data stored in DynamoDB and other services. Although AWS is generally reliable, experts point to a systemic issue: the internet’s heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud providers, reducing resilience and increasing the risk of widespread disruption. The incident echoes previous global outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, underscoring the need for redundancy, competition, and decentralized infrastructure to ensure long-term internet stability.",
