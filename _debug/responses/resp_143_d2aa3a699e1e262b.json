    "The world is expected to see 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100 due to climate change, even under current emissions commitments.",
    "Superhot days are defined as warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991 to 2020, indicating extreme heat events.",
    "Without the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming would have reached 4°C by the end of the century, leading to 114 extra superhot days annually.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already seen an average increase of 11 superhot days per year.",
    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, Solomon Islands, and Samoa face the largest increases in dangerous heat, despite contributing minimally to carbon emissions.",
    "High-emission countries like the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 additional superhot days, despite being responsible for 42% of global CO₂ emissions.",
    "Climate scientists warn that this heat inequality could deepen global inequities and contribute to geopolitical instability.",
    "The study, conducted by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, uses established climate attribution methods and is not yet peer-reviewed, but it is considered scientifically robust.",
    "Experts such as Johan Rockstrom and Friederike Otto emphasize that even under current commitments, the climate future remains disastrous, with tens of thousands or millions of people at risk annually from heat exposure."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that even with current climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, the planet will still face 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous extreme heat—compared to a projected 114 days under a worst-case warming scenario of 4°C. The study highlights a deep global inequality in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra superhot days, despite contributing only 1% of global emissions. In contrast, top emitters such as the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequities and fuel geopolitical instability, emphasizing that while the worst-case scenario has been avoided, the climate future remains dire and unjust for millions of people.",
