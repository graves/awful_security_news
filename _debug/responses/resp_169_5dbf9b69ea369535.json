  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a significant step in its space programme. Developed by SUPARCO, the satellite uses advanced hyperspectral technology to detect subtle material changes on Earth, enabling improved monitoring of agriculture, water resources, environmental health, and geohazards. The launch strengthens Pakistan’s strategic partnership with China and supports development goals such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). While H1 will take about two months to calibrate before full operation, it joins two already operational satellites (EO-1 and KS-1), showing a growing capacity in national space capabilities.",
