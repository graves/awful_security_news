    "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, has sparked a long-standing scientific debate about its origin.",
    "Two main theories exist: the glow could come from pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars), or from annihilations of dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).",
    "New supercomputer simulations show that dark matter in the galactic center may be shaped like an 'egg' — squashed rather than spherical — which closely matches the observed bulge-shaped gamma-ray glow, supporting the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "A 50% chance has been estimated that the glow is due to dark matter, compared to the older stars theory, according to physicist Joseph Silk of Johns Hopkins University.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively determine whether the glow originates from dark matter or pulsars.",
    "Despite decades of effort, dark matter has never been directly observed, and the search continues with experiments like the LZ Dark Matter Experiment in South Dakota, which seeks to detect WIMP annihilations.",
    "The scientific community remains divided: while some, like Tracy Slatyer, find the match between dark matter distribution and the glow plausible, others are skeptical about the shape match.",
    "Supporting the idea that WIMPs could be the answer, experts like Chamkaur Ghag and Nico Cappelluti emphasize that the Fermi detection keeps dark matter as a viable and compelling explanation for a century-old cosmic mystery."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A long-standing mystery of the Milky Way — a mysterious, diffuse gamma-ray glow at its center — has reignited debate over whether it stems from pulsars or dark matter. While earlier observations favored the pulsar explanation due to the glow's match with the spherical shape of the galactic bulge, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter could instead have a squashed, 'egg-shaped' distribution that closely matches the observed glow. This supports a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, particularly WIMPs, which annihilate to produce gamma rays. The study does not confirm dark matter definitively but adds strong plausibility to the theory. A new observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), scheduled to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to determine the true source. The article highlights that despite decades of effort, dark matter remains undetected directly, and the Fermi telescope's detection keeps the WIMP hypothesis alive as a promising, elegant solution to one of the most fundamental mysteries in modern physics.",
