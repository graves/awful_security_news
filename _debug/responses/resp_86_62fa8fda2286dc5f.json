  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, expanded a temporary restraining order targeting aggressive tactics by federal immigration agents during protests in Chicago, requiring all agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during encounters with protesters. The order prohibits the use of tear gas, pepper balls, and other forceful measures against peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and clergy. Judge Ellis expressed concern over reports showing tear gas deployment without warnings and demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court to explain these actions. While the Department of Justice argues that recording body cam footage would be logistically unfeasible, the judge maintains that transparency is essential. Tensions exist between immigration and FBI agents over camera use, and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker supports the judicial intervention, claiming that such measures expose false media narratives. A federal appellate court denied the Trump administration’s request to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois, citing unreliable assessments of unrest, highlighting broader concerns about federal overreach and civil liberties in urban settings.",
