    "Melissa is a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, currently about 300 miles south of Haiti, with sustained winds of 50 mph.",
    "Melissa is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025, making it the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season and the first to form within the Caribbean.",
    "Heavy rain—up to 5 to 10 inches—is forecast for southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic, increasing flood and landslide risks in mountainous terrain.",
    "A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti; a tropical storm watch is in place for Jamaica.",
    "There is a low but non-zero chance Melissa could affect the U.S. mainland, especially Florida, via rough surf and rip currents, or through a delayed northward turn.",
    "Two primary track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa moves toward Jamaica and western Haiti, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane; the other where it moves west toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras).",
    "Melissa’s intensification is linked to climate change, as warmer ocean waters fuel rapid intensification—similar to recent storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto.",
    "Melissa could deliver over a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, increasing flash flood and mudslide risks.",
    "Puerto Rico is at risk of significant rainfall and potential flooding and landslides.",
    "The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, 2025, though tropical systems can still form after that date."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa is moving through the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. It poses a serious threat of life-threatening flooding and mudslides in mountainous areas of Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, with a tropical storm watch in place for Jamaica and a hurricane watch for parts of Haiti. The storm is fueled by warm ocean waters and may undergo extreme rapid intensification, a trend linked to climate change seen in earlier storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Two primary track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa heads toward Jamaica and western Haiti, and another where it moves west toward Central America, possibly affecting Nicaragua or Honduras. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, rough surf and rip currents could affect the East Coast, and Florida could be impacted if the storm turns north later than expected. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, 2025, but tropical systems can still form after that date.",
