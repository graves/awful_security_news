  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a dramatic Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, advancing to their first World Series since 1993. The pivotal moment came when George Springer hit a three-run home run in the seventh inning, turning the game around after being out of the game due to injury in earlier contests. The game featured a controversial play involving Josh Naylor and Ernie Clement, where a ricocheting ball led to a disputed obstruction call. The Blue Jays’ victory is significant because it marks their return to the World Series and ends a 32-year drought, while the Seattle Mariners remain the only MLB franchise never to reach a World Series. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. earned ALCS MVP honors with a .385 average and three home runs. The Blue Jays will host the defending champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, in Game 1 of the World Series on October 25, 2025.",
