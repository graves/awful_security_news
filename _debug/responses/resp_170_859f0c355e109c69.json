The study reveals a stark global inequality: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive increases in heat exposure (e.g., Panama projected at 149 extra days), while major emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts emphasize that this disparity reflects deep climate injustice and may contribute to geopolitical instability, underscoring that climate change impacts are not proportional to carbon emissions.",
