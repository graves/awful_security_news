  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a historic performance during the 2025 National League Championship Series, Shohei Ohtani led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers, cementing his place in baseball lore with an unprecedented feat: hitting three home runs, striking out 10 batters, and pitching a shutout while starting. Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game and the first to do so in a playoff game. The performance, which occurred after a grueling 13-day pitching schedule, earned him NLCS MVP honors and solidified the Dodgers’ place in the World Series. The team, having won the NL pennant five times in the last nine seasons, becomes the first to return to the Fall Classic the year after winning it since the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2000s. With a dominant pitching rotation and deep roster, the Dodgers now face the American League champion—either the Mariners or Blue Jays—for the World Series title, while Ohtani’s game is being hailed as one of the most iconic in modern baseball history.",
