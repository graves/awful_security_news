  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, killing two airport staff in a vehicle it struck and pushed into the sea. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact, with significant damage to the front and tail sections. The four crew members onboard were treated for injuries, and no cargo was reported on board. The aircraft did not transmit distress signals, and officials note that the airport's operations were not significantly disrupted due to the remaining runways being operational. The incident led to a massive emergency response involving over 200 personnel, fire engines, and boats. While rare, aviation accidents at HKIA are not entirely absent, with a previous crash in 1999 involving a China Airlines flight. The event highlights the risks associated with cargo operations and runway safety, especially at one of the world’s busiest airports.",
