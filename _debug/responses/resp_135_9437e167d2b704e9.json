  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Jack Nicklaus, the 18-time major champion golfer, has won a $50 million defamation verdict against his former business partners at the Nicklaus Companies. A jury in Palm Beach County ruled that false claims — including that Nicklaus was joining the LIV Golf League and suffering from dementia — damaged his reputation and exposed him to ridicule and contempt. While Howard Milstein and Andrew O’Brien were named individually as defendants, the jury found no personal liability against them. The case stemmed from a long-standing business dispute over Nicklaus’ right to use his name and image after leaving the company in 2007. Though Nicklaus is now free to design golf courses under his own name, the company retains the rights to use the 'Jack Nicklaus' brand for merchandise.",
