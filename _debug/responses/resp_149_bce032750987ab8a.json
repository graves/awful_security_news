  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the United Nations, has released a report warning that nearly half of the world's countries lack effective early-warning systems for extreme weather, leading to disproportionately high death tolls—especially in developing nations. Over 2 million people have died from weather, water, and climate hazards in the past 50 years, with 90% of those deaths occurring in developing countries. While the number of countries using some form of early-warning systems has increased from 52 to 108, half still have only basic capacity, and 16% have less than basic capacity. The situation is most severe in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Progress is being made in Africa, with more countries launching standardized alerts. The WMO emphasizes that early warning systems enable early action, saving lives and protecting infrastructure. Real-world examples, such as the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a glacier collapse predicted in May 2025 due to permafrost melt, underscore the urgency and effectiveness of timely monitoring and alerts.",
