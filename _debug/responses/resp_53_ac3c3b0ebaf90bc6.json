  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced the end of all U.S. financial payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to curb drug production. This move escalates longstanding tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, particularly over drug trafficking and military interventions in the Caribbean. The U.S. has provided over $210 million in aid this fiscal year, with Colombia being the world’s largest cocaine producer. Trump warned Petro that U.S. forces would take action against drug-producing regions if no progress is made, while Petro responded by criticizing Trump's leadership and invoking Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez’s novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' to underscore cultural and ideological differences. The conflict is further fueled by prior incidents, including the U.S. revocation of Petro’s visa and military strikes on drug vessels, with the most recent strike resulting in fatalities. This escalation marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations, combining economic disengagement with military posturing.",
