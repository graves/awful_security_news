  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals, a rise of eight from the previous year, marking a positive trend after a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report that the recovery is due to improved reproductive health, including four mother whales giving birth and shorter intervals between calves. While 11 calves were born—less than hoped—the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging. The whales still face significant threats from ship collisions and fishing gear, and warming oceans are forcing them into riskier migration routes. Environmental groups warn that current protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act are inadequate and urge Congress to strengthen enforcement to ensure long-term survival.",
