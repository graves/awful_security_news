    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and seven previously restricted ones (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium).",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw materials and specialist equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals and explain the intended use of products containing heavy rare-earth metals.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and seven previously restricted ones, with restrictions on refining equipment set to take effect on December 1, 2025. These controls are justified under national security concerns, citing unauthorized military use of Chinese rare-earth materials. The move comes just weeks before a high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting it is a strategic signal to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China, making it highly vulnerable to supply disruptions. These metals are critical to advanced defence technologies like fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and smart bombs, as well as civilian technologies such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and AI systems. Analysts interpret this as a deliberate pre-meeting move to demonstrate China’s control over a vital global supply chain, raising concerns about technological decoupling and the widening of defence capability gaps between the US and China. Exemptions exist for emergency medical and disaster relief uses.",
