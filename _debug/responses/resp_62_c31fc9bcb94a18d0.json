  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration released two survivors from a failed military strike targeting a drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, undermining its claims that these individuals are dangerous 'narco-terrorists' and posing a threat to American lives. The decision comes amid widespread skepticism over the administration’s lack of evidence, its failure to provide public justification for the strikes, and the absence of congressional authorization. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Harvard’s Jack Goldsmith, argue that the release contradicts the administration’s narrative of a war against narco-terrorists and exposes a pattern of avoiding due process, legal accountability, and transparency. The situation has intensified scrutiny within Congress, where bipartisan concerns are emerging over the legality, oversight, and ethics of these operations, especially given the prior wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and the lack of evidence linking the submarines to fentanyl trafficking heading to the United States.",
