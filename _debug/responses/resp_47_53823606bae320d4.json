    "Legal experts suggest that judges may be more receptive to such claims due to the public pattern of attacks from Trump on individuals being prosecuted, which may indicate a politically motivated prosecution."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is facing criminal charges for allegedly providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. His legal team has launched two key motions to have the charges dismissed: one arguing that the prosecution is a personal vendetta driven by President Donald Trump’s hostility toward Comey, and another claiming that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was illegal under the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, as it bypassed Senate confirmation after a 120-day interim limit. The defense cites public statements from both Trump and Comey, as well as a prior dismissal of Trump’s indictment by a federal judge over similar constitutional concerns, to support their claims. These motions highlight a broader debate over executive overreach, political retaliation, and constitutional protections for speech and the rule of law in federal prosecutions.",
