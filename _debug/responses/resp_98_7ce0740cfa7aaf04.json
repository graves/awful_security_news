  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Andrew Stanton, has been charged with threatening federal law enforcement agents, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, after posting a series of TikTok videos between August and October 2025. In these videos, he called for ICE agents to be shot and killed, made references to the September 10 murder of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, and advocated for mass shootings against federal officials. The investigation began after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, which flagged a request for information on Israeli military positions. Federal agents attempted multiple times to contact Stanton, including a direct message from a US Customs and Border Patrol supervisor on September 11, which resulted in a hostile exchange. Stanton pleaded not guilty and remains in federal detention pending a trial scheduled for December 15, 2025. This case underscores growing national concerns over attacks on federal agents and the role of social media in spreading extremist ideologies.",
