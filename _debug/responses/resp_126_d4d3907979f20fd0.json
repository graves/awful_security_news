  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown encouraging signs of recovery, with an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 — an increase of eight from the previous year and a 7% rise since 2020. Scientists at the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute this growth to conservation efforts, including new measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. Despite ongoing threats such as ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement, the emergence of four new calf-producing mothers and shorter reproductive intervals signals improved health. However, only 11 calves were born, and experts remain cautious, noting that the population is still vulnerable. Environmental groups stress the need for stronger legal protections, especially against weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, to ensure long-term survival.",
