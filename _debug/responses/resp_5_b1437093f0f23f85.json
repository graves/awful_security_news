  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Judge Michael Jesic has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole after 35 years. The decision, which followed a brief but high-stakes hearing, acknowledges the brothers' expressed remorse, rehabilitation efforts, and their contributions to prison programs. Both brothers took full responsibility for the killings, citing years of childhood sexual abuse and self-defense. Family members and prison staff testified to their transformation and remorse. However, opposition remains from current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who claims the brothers fabricated abuse claims and pose a moderate risk of violence. The state parole board will decide whether to recommend release, and Governor Gavin Newsom has the authority to ultimately approve or deny parole, with a 120-day window to act. The brothers are also pursuing a habeas petition with new evidence, including a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez. This development marks a significant shift in the legal and public discourse around punishment, rehabilitation, and justice in high-profile criminal cases.",
