  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 exposed the global vulnerability of digital services to failures in key cloud infrastructure, particularly highlighting the UK's heavy reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. With both AWS and Azure controlling 30–40% of the UK cloud market, even non-hosted services are affected by their operational disruptions, creating a 'nested dependency' that risks cascading economic and public service failures. Experts and regulators, including the CMA, have raised concerns about market concentration, calling for greater competition, interoperability, and national resilience. The UK government is now urged to take political action—such as mandating multi-cloud usage and data replication—to reduce over-dependence and strengthen digital sovereignty, especially in light of geopolitical and security risks tied to US-based cloud dominance.",
