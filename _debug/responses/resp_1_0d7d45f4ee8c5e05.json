  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, is releasing two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. The strike, which marks the sixth such operation since September 2025, raised significant legal concerns regarding the authority to detain individuals after lethal strikes, especially in the absence of congressional authorization for war. The administration claims broad constitutional authority under Article II to target 'narco-terrorists,' but critics and legal experts argue that such actions violate established norms of due process and fall outside traditional law enforcement. The decision to release the survivors appears to stem from uncertainty about the legal basis for detention and may reflect an effort to avoid a legal or diplomatic crisis. The broader context includes a U.S. strategy to reduce drug flow into the country and exert pressure on Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro.",
