    "Antidepressants differ significantly in side effects such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure or cholesterol effects.",
    "The study, conducted by King's College London and the University of Oxford, analyzed 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients across 30 drugs.",
    "SSRIs like citalopram, sertraline, and paroxetine generally have fewer physical side effects, though some (like fluoxetine) have unique effects such as weight loss and elevated blood pressure.",
    "Dr. Toby Pillinger recommends personalized antidepressant selection based on individual health conditions: Sarah (weight gain concern) should avoid amitriptyline and mirtazapine; John (high blood pressure) should avoid venlafaxine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline; Jane (high cholesterol) should avoid venlafaxine, duloxetine, paroxetine.",
    "The research warns that even modest differences in side effects can have significant population-level health impacts due to the scale of antidepressant use (8 million in the UK).",
    "The study shows that current prescribing patterns in the UK are highly centralized—85% of prescriptions are for just three SSRIs—potentially limiting patient-specific care.",
    "The researchers recommend matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and are developing a free online tool to assist doctors and patients in making informed choices.",
    "The findings highlight a need for cultural change within the NHS to prioritize personalized prescribing over standardized, low-cost treatments.",
    "Side effect risks may accumulate over long-term use, especially in individuals with chronic depression, suggesting longer-term monitoring is necessary."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked the side effects of 30 commonly prescribed antidepressants, revealing significant differences in physical impacts such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure or cholesterol effects. The analysis of over 58,500 patients across 151 studies found that even within the widely prescribed SSRI class, drugs like fluoxetine have unique side effects (e.g., weight loss and high blood pressure), while others such as venlafaxine or amitriptyline carry higher risks. Researchers emphasize that no antidepressant is universally suitable—personalized prescribing based on individual health conditions is essential. For example, Sarah, who fears weight gain, should avoid mirtazapine and amitriptyline; John, with high blood pressure, should avoid venlafaxine and amitriptyline; and Jane, with high cholesterol, should avoid drugs like duloxetine and paroxetine. The study warns that current NHS prescribing patterns—where 85% of prescriptions are for just three SSRIs—may overlook patient-specific needs, potentially increasing long-term health risks. To address this, researchers are developing a free online tool to assist clinicians and patients in selecting the best drug. While the study focused on the first eight weeks of treatment, experts note that long-term cumulative risks are likely to be greater, especially in chronic depression cases. This study shifts the focus from one-size-fits-all treatment to individualized, evidence-based care, with implications for public health and clinical practice.",
