  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, along with Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and Republican Senator Rand Paul, led a bipartisan effort to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution aimed at preventing President Donald Trump from unilaterally declaring war on Venezuela. The move follows multiple U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean and covert CIA operations in Venezuela, which Trump claims are targeting drug smuggling. Critics, including Kaine and Paul, argue these actions violate constitutional norms and lack transparency—specifically, the absence of shared evidence or public debate. The resolution, which will be voted on after a 10-day waiting period, seeks to uphold Congress’s authority to declare war and prevent executive overreach. While previous similar votes have seen limited Republican support (only about 10 Republicans have backed such measures), there is hope for broader bipartisan backing. The lack of transparency around deaths in the strikes (at least 27 reported) and the ongoing debate over legality and public accountability underscore the broader significance of this congressional action in safeguarding democratic checks on executive power.",
