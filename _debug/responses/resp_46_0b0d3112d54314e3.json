  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, under President Donald Trump’s administration. The survivors, including Jeison Obando Perez, were critically injured and medically treated upon return. The release marks the first time the Trump administration has detained individuals after a military drug strike, raising serious legal questions about the use of lethal force and due process. The US has conducted six such strikes since September, targeting vessels linked to drug trafficking and aimed at pressuring Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. However, this campaign has sparked diplomatic tensions, especially in Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro accused the US of violating sovereignty and killing civilian fisherman Alejandro Carranza in a prior strike. Legal experts question the constitutional authority of such actions, as Congress has not authorized war against drug traffickers, and traditional criminal justice principles suggest due process rights should apply. This incident highlights a significant policy and legal dilemma: balancing national security goals with international law, human rights, and constitutional boundaries.",
