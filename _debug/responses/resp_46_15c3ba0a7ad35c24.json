  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US Navy detained two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, marking the first time the Trump administration has held individuals after a lethal operation. The strike, confirmed by President Donald Trump, is part of a broader campaign to disrupt drug trafficking and pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been accused of offering concessions in exchange for reduced temperatures. The operation raises significant legal questions, including whether the administration has constitutional authority under Article II to conduct strikes and detain suspects without due process, especially as drug traffickers are traditionally treated as criminals under civilian law. Legal experts have highlighted potential avenues for detainees to challenge their detention via habeas corpus, and the administration has yet to clarify its legal basis or the future disposition of the survivors.",
