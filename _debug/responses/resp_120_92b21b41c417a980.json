  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that introducing peanut products to infants as early as 4 months reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research shows a significant real-world decline in allergy rates in the U.S. After 2015, peanut allergy rates in children aged 0 to 3 fell by over 27%, and by over 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records and found that early allergen introduction has led to approximately 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies. Despite initial slow adoption—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the updated guidelines—public health efforts and increased awareness have led to widespread implementation. Experts and advocacy groups like FARE now support early exposure to allergens such as peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products as safe and effective. This shift is seen as a major public health victory in reducing the prevalence of a life-threatening condition.",
