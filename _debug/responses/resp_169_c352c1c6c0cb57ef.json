  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating in protected areas of Pará. The report documents how cattle from illegally deforested land are 'laundered' through state-approved animal transit permits (GTAs), which lack individual tracking and thus conceal origins. Key protected zones, including the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa, have seen severe encroachments, with Indigenous communities facing violence and displacement. Despite JBS’s past commitments to trace indirect suppliers and its 2024 acknowledgment of traceability gaps, the company has not implemented effective verification mechanisms. The article highlights systemic flaws in Brazil’s cattle traceability system, including inadequate data collection and enforcement, and calls for stronger federal action — such as making GTA data publicly accessible and mandating individual animal tracking — to hold corporations and governments accountable. The findings are especially significant in the lead-up to COP30, where global attention is focused on corporate environmental responsibility and the climate impact of agriculture.",
