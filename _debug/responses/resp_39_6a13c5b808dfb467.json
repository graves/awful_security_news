  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products, arguing that the claim linking its use during pregnancy to autism or ADHD lacks scientific backing. The push originated from a public statement by former President Donald Trump, who claimed without evidence that Tylenol use increases autism risk, prompting action from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Informed Consent Action Network, which filed a citizen petition urging the FDA to add warnings. However, the FDA and leading medical bodies, including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, emphasize that current research does not establish a causal relationship, and that acetaminophen remains safe and widely recommended for use during pregnancy. International health agencies in the EU, UK, and Canada have similarly affirmed its safety, and the FDA has not updated its labeling despite the political pressure.",
