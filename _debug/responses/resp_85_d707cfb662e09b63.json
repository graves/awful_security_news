  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Western sanctions on Iran, particularly since 2012, have severely damaged the country’s middle class — a historically reform-minded and economically stable demographic that once drove political change and social development. A study using a synthetic control method found that, without sanctions, Iran’s middle class would have grown by 17% between 2012 and 2019, but in reality, it shrank by 28%, with nearly 9 million Iranians losing middle-class status. Inflation has soared to 42.4%, making basic goods unaffordable, while the wealthy enjoy luxury services and mobility. This growing wealth gap has shifted political engagement from reform-oriented middle-class demands to fragmented, survival-focused protests. Sanctions have also funneled resources to state-linked actors like the IRGC and bonyads, strengthening hardline power structures. As a result, the political landscape has shifted, and the long-term stability of Iran’s democracy is at risk. Experts warn that rebuilding the middle class is a generational challenge, even if sanctions are lifted.",
