  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the product’s safety label that would warn pregnant women about a potential link between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD in children. The FDA has not found clear evidence of harm from appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, and multiple large-scale studies — including one involving over 2 million children — have found no significant associations. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that Tylenol use increases autism risk, these assertions lack scientific support. Kenvue argues that the label changes are arbitrary and unsupported by evidence, and the FDA has maintained its position that acetaminophen remains safe. International health agencies including the EU, UK, and Health Canada have also affirmed the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. The article highlights the tension between political messaging and scientific evidence in public health policy.",
