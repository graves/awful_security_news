  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS), which was led by Evo Morales. The election was driven by Bolivia’s deepening economic crisis, including high inflation, declining gas exports, and fuel shortages. Paz, representing the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote but lacks a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building. His platform promotes gradual reform, private sector growth, and regional fiscal autonomy, while maintaining social programs. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal through populist messaging. The new government faces challenges in securing fuel supplies, managing inflation, and gaining labor union support. Both candidates pledged stronger diplomatic ties with the United States, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the election a transformative opportunity. Analysts view this as a significant political shift in Bolivia’s democracy, signaling a new era of economic and political direction.",
