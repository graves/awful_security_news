  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Ghizer, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual weather patterns, animal behavior, and using traditional signals like gunfire—to warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), despite government investments in technological early warning systems. These systems have failed to gain trust due to frequent malfunctions, lack of real-time data transmission, and poor community engagement. Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, shepherds from Roshan and Skardu valleys, exemplify how personal initiative and traditional knowledge have saved lives when technology failed. Pakistan, ranked among the top 10 climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, faces growing risks from glacier melt and reduced snowfall, with temperatures rising 1.3°C since the 1950s. The GLOF-II project, launched in 2017 with a $37 million budget, has not achieved operational success or community trust, leading to persistent reliance on human-based early warnings. Experts and journalists highlight systemic issues such as weak institutional capacity and communication barriers, emphasizing that climate resilience in Pakistan must integrate traditional knowledge with improved governance and trust-building.",
