  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen in early 2025, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam, which involved fake calls from a 'General' and a cloned voice of Crosetto, led to one businessman, Massimo Moratti, making a transfer that was later frozen by authorities. Research by Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices in many cases, with participants often perceiving them as more trustworthy. Global losses from similar scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025, and AI-generated content, including child sexual abuse material, has become a major concern. In response, the U.S. and Australia have introduced new laws banning the creation and distribution of AI-generated intimate images. While AI voice technology offers benefits such as helping individuals who cannot speak, its misuse in scams and deepfakes poses serious ethical and security risks to individuals and societies.",
