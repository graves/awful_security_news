  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Colombia and Ecuador, under President Donald Trump’s administration. The strike, the sixth in recent months, targeted a vessel allegedly carrying narcotics and killing four individuals, with two survivors being medically evaluated and returned. The action has raised significant legal and diplomatic concerns, including constitutional questions about the authority to detain individuals without due process, violations of territorial sovereignty by Colombia, and accusations of targeting civilians. Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the US of killing a fishing boat’s crew in a prior strike, citing a lack of connection to drug trafficking. The US has defended its actions under broad constitutional powers, though Congress has not authorized such armed conflict, creating a legal and policy dilemma.",
