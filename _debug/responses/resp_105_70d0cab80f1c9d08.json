  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A grassroots movement in Missouri, led by volunteers like Leann Villaluz and the group People Not Politicians Missouri, is challenging the state’s newly gerrymandered congressional map, which targets long-time Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II’s district in Kansas City. The map was approved by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe and passed by a Republican-dominated legislature, including support from figures like Michael Davis, though 15 Republicans including Bill Allen and Jon Patterson opposed it. The campaign aims to collect 106,000 signatures by December 11, 2025, to force a voter referendum in 2026, where Missourians could decide whether to keep or reject the map. State officials, including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, have challenged the petition, claiming it violates constitutional law and that signatures were collected improperly. The effort is supported by the Democratic National Committee and legal challenges, including one led by progressive candidate Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan, who argues that redistricting undermines local needs and federal resource access. The movement reflects broader national debates over fair representation, democratic legitimacy, and the impact of partisan gerrymandering, especially in urban centers already facing systemic challenges.",
