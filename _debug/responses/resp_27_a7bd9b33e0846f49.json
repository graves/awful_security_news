    "In the case of Marimar Martinez, DHS claimed she was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and drove into a vehicle, but the criminal complaint states she only side-swiped a vehicle and used a motor vehicle as a 'dangerous weapon'; body-camera footage is allegedly showing the CBP vehicle swerving into hers.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A series of public statements by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during its immigration crackdown in Chicago and Massachusetts have been undermined by video evidence, legal filings, and local officials. Key incidents include the arrest of WGN employee Debbie Brockman, where DHS claimed she assaulted agents but she was released without charges and her attorneys assert she was violently assaulted; the shooting of US citizen Marimar Martinez, where DHS claimed she was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, but the criminal complaint states she only side-swiped a vehicle and used a vehicle as a dangerous weapon; and the arrest of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts, where DHS claimed the teen had a firearm and knife, but the local mayor confirmed only a knife was found. A federal judge in Chicago temporarily halted the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, calling DHS statements about protests 'not reliable' due to lack of indictments and probable cause. The judge also ordered federal immigration agents to use body-worn cameras during protests, citing transparency and the need to verify events in real time. Experts warn that in the digital age, such misleading claims can be easily disproven by public video, raising serious concerns about the credibility and accountability of DHS's enforcement narratives.",
