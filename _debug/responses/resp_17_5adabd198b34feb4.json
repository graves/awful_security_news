    "Government enforcement is weak: labor inspectors are blocked from factory visits, and union members are often fired after complaints.",
    "The Guatemalan government under President Bernardo Arévalo has raised the minimum wage and pledged reforms, but structural and political barriers remain.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A CNN investigation reveals widespread labor abuses in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as 'maquilas,' where thousands of mostly female workers face exploitative conditions such as long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite their economic importance—accounting for nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP—workers have little legal protection, with US brands like Target and Ralph Lauren benefiting from subcontracting without accountability. Korean companies dominate the industry, controlling nearly two-thirds of investments, and unions are rare and often suppressed. Workers report being fired for complaints, facing threats of violence, and losing pensions and severance. Government efforts under President Bernardo Arévalo to raise wages and enforce labor laws remain constrained by systemic resistance and lack of enforcement. The article underscores the human cost of global supply chains and calls attention to the need for greater transparency, worker empowerment, and international accountability.",
