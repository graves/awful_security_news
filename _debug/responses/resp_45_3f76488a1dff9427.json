  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers are raising alarm over a policy shift within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system that limits the number of one-on-one therapy sessions available to veterans, particularly those with chronic conditions like PTSD. The policy, intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since January 2025, mandates fixed session limits (typically 4–24) without clinical flexibility, leading providers to face disciplinary actions if they extend care. Veterans such as Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized when sessions are abruptly ended, especially when they are still in recovery. While the VA denies such limits exist and claims care is patient-centered, providers and veterans argue that long-term therapy is clinically necessary and should be based on shared decision-making. The American Psychological Association has expressed concern, calling for individualized, recovery-oriented care. The policy has also contributed to staff resignations, including from former VA psychologists Stephen Long and Mark Jorges, due to frustration and ethical concerns. The broader debate centers on whether rigid session caps—common in private insurance systems—are appropriate for veterans with long-term mental health needs, especially when treatment for conditions like PTSD is continuous and essential to recovery.",
