  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment in Chicago that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests. In a recent hearing, she pressed federal officials—including CBP and ICE leaders—on compliance with her temporary restraining order requiring body-worn cameras during protests. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams have not been issued them, raising transparency concerns. The judge expressed concern over the use of tear gas and pepper balls without prior warning, particularly after a pastor, Rev. David Black, reported being struck multiple times without notice. ICE agents have training on crowd control and press interactions, but enforcement actions are subject to internal review. The federal leadership has been described as a 'revolving door,' with frequent changes in key personnel, and the judge plans to depose former ICE Chicago head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to gain further insight into on-the-ground operations.",
