  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump continues to push for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but hopes for a quick meeting may be stalled after a planned pre-meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was tabled due to divergent views on ending the war. Rubio and Lavrov had previously discussed steps toward peace, but officials believe Russia’s position remains maximalist and has not evolved sufficiently. While the Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, Hungary, remains a possibility, the delay in the pre-meeting suggests significant diplomatic challenges, especially regarding the war’s endgame. Trump has consistently called for an immediate ceasefire and has emphasized that peace should be established at the battle line, underscoring his commitment to peace despite past summit failures.",
