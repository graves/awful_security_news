  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing—constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942—as part of a $250 million project to build a new ballroom. Despite claiming the new structure would remain separate from the original building, the physical demolition of the covered entryway and windows indicates a significant alteration. The project, to be led by Clark Construction and designed by McCrery Architects, is being privately funded with no disclosed donors. The National Park Service and preservation groups, including the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects, have raised alarms over the lack of a formal review process, calling it inappropriate and historically damaging. This marks a departure from traditional protocols that ensure historical integrity and public transparency, especially given the White House's status as the 'People's House' and a symbol of national heritage. The move has sparked concerns about the balance between presidential modernization and the preservation of architectural and historical continuity.",
