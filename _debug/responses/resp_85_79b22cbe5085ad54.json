  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number and wet-leased from ACT, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) during arrival from Dubai around 3:50 a.m. local time. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon exiting the runway, colliding with an airport security patrol car and pushing it into the sea, killing two occupants. No distress signals were reported by the pilots. Four crew members on board were treated for injuries and are confirmed safe. The airport suspended operations on its north runway, though other runways remain active, minimizing flight disruptions. The incident is rare at HKIA, which has a history of only a few fatal accidents, including a 1999 crash involving a China Airlines flight. The former Kai Tak Airport, once known for its challenging landing conditions, is referenced in context of the airport's operational history.",
