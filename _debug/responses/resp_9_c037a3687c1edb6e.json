  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged federal government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers are going unpaid, while lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, judges, and confirmed political appointees continue to receive salaries under constitutional provisions. The Trump administration has taken steps to pay certain essential workers, including 70,000 DHS law enforcement personnel and FBI agents, as well as used $8 billion in Pentagon funds to cover military paychecks. However, many federal employees—especially those in agencies like the IRS—have been furloughed or are working without pay, with no guarantee of back pay. The White House is questioning the applicability of a 2019 law that guarantees back pay, suggesting it does not cover furloughed employees. Federal contractors face no compensation guarantees, and the political debate over who should be paid continues, with Senate GOP leaders proposing a bill that would pay essential workers, though Democrats oppose it unless applied universally. The financial strain on federal workers is significant, with many at risk of losing homes, vehicles, or being unable to feed their families.",
