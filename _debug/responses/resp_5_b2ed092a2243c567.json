  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump, leveraging his experience in branding and marketing from his real estate business, has applied those strategies to the federal government during his second term. Initiatives such as TrumpRx, the Trump Gold Card, a proposed Trump coin, the F-47 fighter jet, and the rebranded Rose Garden Club reflect a broader effort to personify the government around his identity. The MAGA movement serves as a cultural touchstone, reinforcing his political brand. While these efforts align with business branding principles, they raise ethical and normative concerns about the commodification of public institutions, government spending, and the role of personal identity in policy. Critics warn that this approach blurs the line between public service and self-promotion, potentially undermining democratic norms. Despite some failures, Trump’s branding has proven effective in capturing attention and shaping public perception, setting a precedent for future administrations.",
