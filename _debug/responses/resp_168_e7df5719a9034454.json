    "The 2025 Nobel Prizes began on October 6 with the award of the Physiology or Medicine Prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced research into cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The prize announcement schedule includes five core categories: medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace, with economics announced last, all by designated institutions.",
    "The Nobel Prizes are among the most prestigious global recognitions, established by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist, whose will created a foundation for rewarding human benefit.",
    "The nomination process is highly secretive, with experts, past winners, and academics submitting nominations by January 31, and decisions kept confidential for 50 years.",
    "The Peace Prize in 2025 has drawn significant public attention due to claims by U.S. President Donald Trump about deserving it for ending wars, though experts argue such claims are unlikely given the prize's focus on durable peace and institutional work.",
    "The Nobel committees emphasize academic freedom, with concerns raised that political interference from the Trump administration could threaten the integrity of scientific research and prize selection.",
    "Past laureates include Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine, 2024) for microRNA discovery; John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics, 2024) for foundational work in machine learning; David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry, 2024) for breakthroughs in protein structure prediction via AI; Han Kang (literature, 2024) for poetic exploration of trauma; and Nihon Hidankyo (peace, 2024) for nuclear disarmament advocacy; and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (economic sciences, 2024) for analyzing institutions’ role in economic development.",
    "The prizes are formally presented in Stockholm and Oslo, with the Stockholm ceremony attended by royalty and the Oslo ceremony honoring the Peace Prize, reflecting the international and symbolic nature of the awards."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced research into cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full set of prizes is announced over a week, from October 6 to October 13, with the final prize—the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences—announced on the 13th. The awards are administered by five distinct institutions, each with a specific mandate, and are rooted in the original 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist and chemist. The nominations process is highly secretive and protected by a 50-year silence rule, emphasizing independence and objectivity. The Peace Prize has attracted significant global attention due to claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he deserves the award for ending wars, though experts argue such claims are inconsistent with the prize’s focus on durable peace and institutional work. Concerns have also been raised that political interference from the Trump administration threatens academic freedom, with Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy warning of long-term consequences for scientific integrity. Past laureates such as Han Kang, John Hopfield, and David Baker highlight the broad scope of the prizes, from medicine and physics to literature and economics, demonstrating their enduring role in recognizing transformative human achievements.",
