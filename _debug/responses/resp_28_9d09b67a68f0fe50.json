While some parks remain open using state funding—such as in West Virginia—advocacy groups warn about increased safety risks, including unregulated activities like drone use and base jumping, and environmental harm like trash buildup. Tourist behavior has shifted, with visitors flocking to private museums in DC, which have seen significant visitor surges. However, local businesses near parks report mixed outcomes, with some unaffected and others facing declining bookings. The long-term economic and safety impacts are a growing concern, especially during peak tourism months, prompting calls for park closures to protect public safety and preserve the integrity of national park experiences.",
