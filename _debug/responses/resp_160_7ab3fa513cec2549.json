  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained by U.S. immigration authorities in March 2025 after his activism at Columbia University drew government scrutiny. His release in June 2025, based on a habeas corpus petition, is now under appeal by a U.S. appeals court, which is being asked to uphold the lower court’s decision. The government argues that Khalil’s presence poses adverse foreign policy consequences and that he concealed his work with UNRWA on immigration applications, which may justify deportation. However, advocates including the ACLU and legal experts contend that the administration’s use of foreign policy grounds to deport individuals for political speech violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutional. A prior ruling by Judge William Young found that the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists was unlawful, as it aimed to silence criticism of Israel. With Khalil’s case now in multiple stages of appeal—both in immigration proceedings and constitutional review—the legal battle continues, and the outcome may set a precedent on the limits of government power in suppressing political expression through immigration laws.",
