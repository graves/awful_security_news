  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like lightning, animal behavior, and unusual sounds—is being used by local communities to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), particularly in the absence of reliable, trusted early warning systems. Despite government investments like the $37 million GLOF-II project, residents have expressed deep skepticism due to malfunctioning equipment, lack of follow-up, and poor community engagement. Real-life examples, such as shepherd Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, show how traditional human-based signals—like gunfire or fire—have successfully saved lives. The article underscores that Pakistan, one of the most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, faces escalating risks from warming temperatures, reduced snowfall, and glacier melt. Ultimately, it highlights a critical truth: while technological early warning systems are being deployed, community trust and Indigenous knowledge remain indispensable to saving lives in the face of climate change.",
