  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Every year, an estimated billion birds in the United States die from collisions with glass during migration season, a problem that has received growing attention due to high-profile incidents such as the 2023 event at Chicago’s McCormick Place Convention Center where over a thousand birds died in a single night. This event prompted the formation of the Bird Collision Prevention Alliance, a coalition of over 100 organizations working to implement science-based solutions. Case studies like the Chicago convention center, where a dot-pattern film reduced collisions by 95%, and Dallas, where the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center is being redesigned to be bird-friendly, show that effective solutions exist. Volunteers in cities like Washington, D.C. and Chicago are actively collecting data and advocating for changes, including turning off artificial lights and treating windows with protective films. While retrofitting large buildings remains costly, the cumulative impact of individual actions — including homeowners treating known hazardous windows — can significantly reduce bird deaths. The article underscores that glass, not cats or habitat loss, is the leading cause of bird mortality and calls for scalable, practical, and scientifically grounded solutions to protect migratory birds.",
