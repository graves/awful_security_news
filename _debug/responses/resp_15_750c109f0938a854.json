  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "CVS experienced a network system outage on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, which prevented some of its pharmacies from filling or delivering prescriptions, leading to customer frustration and complaints on social media. The company confirmed the issue was a network connection problem and stated it had resolved the outage, though some patients faced minor delays. This incident occurred just one day after a major AWS outage, which disrupted critical services such as hospital communications, smart home devices, and financial services like Chime and Ring. The parallel events underscore the growing societal dependence on cloud-based systems and the vulnerability of essential services when such systems fail, raising broader concerns about digital infrastructure resilience.",
