  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a national who survived a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel allegedly smuggling drugs in the Caribbean. The US conducted at least seven strikes since September 2025, killing 32 people and claiming to target narco-terrorists, including Venezuelan-linked groups like the Tren de Aragua and the Cartel of the Suns. Despite US assertions that the vessel carried fentanyl and was a 'drug-carrying submarine,' experts question both the vessel's origin and the legality of the operations under international law. The Colombian survivor, Jeison Obando Pérez, sustained a traumatic brain injury and is being treated in Bogotá, with Colombia asserting that cocaine trafficking is a crime. Ecuadorean authorities refused to detain Tufiño due to lack of criminal charges, while Colombia and other regional governments have expressed concern over territorial violations and human rights implications. The US claims to have deployed around 10,000 troops and numerous military assets to the region, and US President Donald Trump has accused Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro of leading drug trafficking operations, which Maduro denies. These events have intensified diplomatic tensions, with Colombia accusing the US of murder and threatening to cut aid, while Trinidad and Tobago expresses support for US military action despite local casualties.",
