  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a Marine Corps 250th-anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a live artillery firing over the I-5 interstate occurred — a practice not seen in over 70 years. One of the 155mm shells fired by an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the highway, sending shrapnel that damaged a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The incident sparked controversy between Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the activity 'dangerous' and closed the highway, and Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who defended it as an established safe practice. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause of the premature detonation, particularly given that the same batch of shells had previously fired successfully. Background context includes a surge in U.S. 155mm shell production since 2022, driven by Ukraine’s war effort, and prior manufacturing issues reported by Reuters involving cracked shells and changes in explosives. Experts note that such a firing over a major highway is rare and the incident raises serious questions about shell integrity and safety protocols, even if no injuries occurred.",
