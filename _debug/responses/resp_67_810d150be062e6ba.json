  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted on 18 counts of unlawfully sharing classified information through personal emails with his wife and daughter. The investigation began in 2020 after Trump criticized Bolton’s memoir for allegedly containing classified content, but was paused. A 2021 Iranian hack of Bolton’s AOL email account reignited the probe, leading to a formal FBI investigation and a search of his home and office in August 2025, which uncovered documents labeled as 'classified' and 'confidential'. Six career prosecutors, including Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara, signed the indictment, indicating institutional support. Despite political pressure from President Trump, who repeatedly attacked Bolton and urged swift action, the case progressed only after the indictments of other political figures like Robert Mueller’s former chief, James, and former FBI director Comey. The final indictment was delivered in a private, brief proceeding, with prosecutors and the grand jury foreperson delivering it to a magistrate without public disclosure. Bolton pleaded not guilty and claimed the case is politically motivated, a result of Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department. This case reflects broader concerns about political interference in federal investigations and the use of national security laws against political critics.",
