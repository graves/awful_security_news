  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that these recommendations have led to measurable public health benefits. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in U.S. children under age 3 have declined by over 27% and by more than 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. A study led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, using electronic health records, found that early allergen exposure is now being adopted and is significantly reducing allergy incidence. Approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. Despite initial resistance and slow adoption among medical professionals, evidence shows that early feeding of allergenic foods like peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based products is now widely recommended and supported by both medical professionals and parents. This shift reflects a major public health success in preventing a life-threatening condition.",
