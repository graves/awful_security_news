  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, the body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, one of 28 deceased hostages, was identified after being returned by Hamas to Israel, marking the 12th confirmed body returned under a ceasefire agreement that began in late 2025. The other identified body was Israeli man Ronen Engel, whose family expressed deep grief. The return of these bodies has intensified domestic and international pressure, with protests erupting in Israel and the US warning of a potential ceasefire violation by Hamas. While Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains and that further retrieval is technically difficult, Israeli intelligence suggests Hamas may know the locations of remaining victims and is using them as leverage. The Rafah crossing remains closed, blocking humanitarian aid, and Israel continues military operations, including a strike on a civilian vehicle that killed nine people. The US and Israeli leaders have emphasized that the war will only end when all hostages are returned and Hamas is demilitarized, underscoring the fragile and contested nature of the ceasefire.",
