  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, following escalating tensions over drug trafficking, U.S. military actions targeting vessels allegedly involved in smuggling, and accusations that the U.S. supported a political plot to remove President Gustavo Petro from power. This marks the second such diplomatic move in 2025, with the U.S. having previously recalled its ambassador to Bogotá in July. The conflict intensified after President Donald Trump accused Petro of being a drug trafficker and threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian exports, while U.S. warships launched missile attacks on seven vessels, killing at least 30 people, including some alleged to be Colombian citizens. Colombia claims these operations amount to state violence and murder, accusing the U.S. of targeting its nationals and undermining bilateral relations.",
