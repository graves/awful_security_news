  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and VA mental health providers across the U.S. report that one-on-one therapy sessions are being abruptly limited or terminated under new policies implemented since January 2025, particularly under VA Secretary Doug Collins. These limits, which cap therapy at between four and 24 sessions, are being enforced even when clinicians determine patients need longer-term care for chronic conditions like PTSD. Providers say the policy is not clinically appropriate, undermines trust, and has led to staff resignations and re-traumatization of patients. Veterans such as Michael and Jake Pannell express fear that they are being abandoned and that their recovery is being compromised. While the VA maintains that there are no limits on appointments and that care is patient-centered, internal reports and provider testimonies reveal a significant gap between official statements and actual practice. The American Psychological Association is investigating, emphasizing that veterans deserve individualized, recovery-focused care through shared decision-making.",
