The deal, supported by the US State Department as a step toward ending abuse of the asylum system, mirrors agreements with Paraguay and other Central American nations. Belize Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño describes the arrangement as a job programme for qualified Central American migrants, while opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton warns of risks to national sovereignty, security, and public finances. Critics, including human rights groups, argue that migrants may face harm in Belize or other countries with inadequate protections. The agreement still requires Senate approval and details remain limited, placing it within a broader US policy under President Donald Trump that emphasizes mass deportations and third-country transfers, backed by a Supreme Court ruling in June 2025.",
