    "Scientists have long been puzzled by a mysterious, diffuse glow of gamma rays observed at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008.",
    "Two primary explanations have emerged: the glow could be from pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars), or from collisions between dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).",
    "Previous models of dark matter assumed a spherical shape, but new supercomputer simulations show that dark matter in the galactic center may be squashed into an egg-shaped structure, matching the observed bulge-like glow.",
    "This new simulation provides stronger support for the dark matter theory, increasing the estimated probability that the glow is due to dark matter to 50%, compared to the older pulsar theory.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will offer higher-resolution gamma-ray data that could confirm or rule out the dark matter explanation.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter, the growing theoretical support and the potential for observational confirmation make the WIMP hypothesis a compelling candidate.",
    "The search for dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern physics, with implications for our understanding of the universe’s composition and structure."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists have re-evaluated the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow observed at the center of the Milky Way since 2008, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. While the glow has long been attributed to pulsars, new simulations using supercomputers now suggest that dark matter—specifically, collisions between WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)—could produce a bulge-shaped glow that matches the observed pattern. The simulations reveal that dark matter in the galactic center may be squashed into an egg-shaped form, a feature previously unaccounted for in spherical models. This finding increases the likelihood that the glow originates from dark matter, bringing it to a 50% probability versus pulsar sources. However, definitive confirmation will come from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin operations in 2027, which will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data. The study reinforces the ongoing scientific quest to identify dark matter, a fundamental and long-standing mystery in physics, with WIMPs remaining a key candidate despite no direct detection to date.",
