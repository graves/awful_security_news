    "Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, asserting that going to trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to weak evidence, victim non-cooperation, and jurisdictional issues.",
    "The plea deal resulted in Epstein serving only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges, which many critics labeled a 'sweetheart deal' or a failure to protect minors.",
    "Acosta acknowledged that victims had changing stories and that many refused to testify, which made a trial highly risky and legally uncertain.",
    "Acosta claimed that the U.S. Attorney’s office, including prosecutors, all agreed that a pre-trial resolution was the best path to ensure Epstein was incarcerated.",
    "Acosta opposed Epstein’s work release program, which allowed him to be outside jail during business hours, and objected in writing to the arrangement.",
    "Acosta stated he did not know whether Donald Trump was interviewed in connection with the Epstein investigation, nor did he recall any documents linking Trump to Epstein's case.",
    "Despite the lack of direct evidence connecting Trump to Epstein, the article references a 2002 New York Magazine article where Trump described Epstein as a 'terrific guy' and someone who enjoys young women, and a 2007 article alleging Epstein attempted to procure girls at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "Acosta maintained that his resignation from the Labor Secretary role in 2019 was entirely his own decision, not due to any instruction or pressure from Trump or his administration."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing that a federal trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to unreliable victim testimony, jurisdictional ambiguities, and lack of evidence of cross-state activity. In a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta stated that prosecutors at the time unanimously favored a negotiated resolution to ensure Epstein served time. He criticized the work release program allowed by the Palm Beach sheriff and acknowledged criticism from victims and the public. Acosta emphasized that his resignation from the Labor Secretary role in 2019 was entirely his own decision, not due to pressure from Trump or his administration. The article also references two media reports—New York Magazine's 2002 article where Trump described Epstein as a 'terrific guy' and a 2007 article alleging Epstein tried to recruit girls at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club—which have fueled ongoing speculation about a connection between Trump and Epstein, though Acosta stated he was unaware of any direct interviews or documents linking Trump to the case.",
