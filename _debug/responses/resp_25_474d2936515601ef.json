  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the hidden human cost behind 'made in Guatemala' clothing labels. Despite the sector's economic importance—accounting for nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP—workers in maquila factories face extreme exploitation: daily quotas, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Most are women, and union activity is severely restricted or met with retaliation. Korean-owned companies dominate the industry, and major U.S. fashion brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren benefit from these supply chains without legal responsibility for labor practices. Workers such as Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face devastating financial and emotional outcomes, including job loss, pension forfeiture, and lifelong poverty. Despite government efforts and reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo, enforcement remains weak due to factory resistance, lack of access, and political inaction. The article underscores a global pattern of gendered labor abuse in the garment supply chain and calls for greater accountability and reform in international manufacturing.",
