  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A California judge, Michael Jesic, has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The brothers, who previously served life without parole, took full responsibility for the killings, citing years of sexual abuse and self-defense. Family members and prison advocates testified to their remorse, rehabilitation, and contributions to prison life, including Lyle’s $250,000 beautification program and Erik’s support groups. However, current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes the resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of recidivism. The California State Parole Board will review the case and recommend a decision, which will then be sent to Governor Gavin Newsom for final approval. Newsom has the authority to grant or deny parole and can also commute the sentence, though he has not acted yet. The brothers have also filed a habeas petition for a new trial, citing new evidence, such as a 1988 letter from Erik referencing abuse. The case remains a high-profile legal and moral debate about rehabilitation, truth, and justice.",
