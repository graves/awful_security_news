  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A historic Clydebuilt ship, the Falls of Clyde, built in 1878 and moored in Honolulu since the 1960s, was deliberately sunk off the coast of Hawaii in 2025 after years of deteriorating condition and failed attempts to bring it back to Scotland for restoration. The ship, originally constructed by Russell & Co. in Port Glasgow, was damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s and left to decay. A decade-long campaign led by Scottish advocate David O'Neill and supported by groups like Friends of Falls of Clyde, sought to repatriate the vessel to Scotland. While two firms—Norwegian and American—offered free transport, agreements collapsed due to disputes over insurance and other conditions. The final scuttling, carried out by a third company, sparked outrage from maritime conservation groups in both the UK and USA, who described the action as a betrayal of heritage. The Hawaii Department of Transportation confirmed the ship was sunk 25 miles south of Honolulu, with its name, wheel, and bell preserved for public display. The incident has intensified global awareness of the risks to maritime heritage when preservation efforts are undermined by institutional decisions, and has inspired renewed efforts to bring another Clydebuilt vessel, HMS Ambuscade, back to Scotland.",
