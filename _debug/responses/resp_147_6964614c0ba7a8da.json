  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China Eastern Airlines is resuming direct flights between Shanghai and Delhi, starting November 9, 2025, after a five-year suspension. This marks a significant diplomatic thaw between China and India, prompted by rising U.S. trade tensions and the aggressive tariff policies of former U.S. President Donald Trump. The flight schedule includes three weekly services on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The resumption follows deadly border clashes in 2020, which led to a prolonged military stand-off and halted air travel. India’s government and private carriers, including IndiGo, have also taken steps to expand air links, with support from Chinese airports such as Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. This development reflects broader efforts to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties amid global trade volatility and U.S. pressure on both nations.",
