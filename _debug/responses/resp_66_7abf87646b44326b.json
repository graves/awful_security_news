  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a meticulously planned heist that took place just after the opening of the Louvre Museum in Paris on October 19, 2025, four armed individuals stole eight of nine high-value Crown Jewels from the Apollo Gallery. Using a truck-mounted ladder and an angle grinder, they forced open a window and fled on motorcycles, leaving behind one damaged item—the crown of Empress Eugénie. The stolen items include jewelry from Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense and Empress Marie-Louise, all of which hold immense historical and sentimental value. The museum remained closed for security and evidence preservation. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and Culture Minister Rachida Dati, condemned the act as an attack on national heritage and emphasized efforts to recover the items and bring the perpetrators to justice. An investigation into organized crime and possible foreign interference has been launched. Experts warn that the thieves may have melted or recut the jewelry, risking permanent loss of cultural integrity.",
