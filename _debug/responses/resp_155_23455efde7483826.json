    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, and seven previously restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions include both rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used to refine them, with effective implementation scheduled for December 1, 2025.",
    "The move is framed under national security grounds, citing concerns over foreign entities transferring or processing Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications.",

The measures, announced by the Ministry of Commerce and set to take effect on December 1, 2025, are framed under national security concerns and are seen as a strategic move ahead of a high-stakes U.S.-China meeting during the APEC summit in South Korea. The U.S., the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant vulnerabilities in its defence and civilian technology sectors, including in critical systems like F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors. Analysts interpret the move as a deliberate signaling tactic to strengthen China’s negotiating leverage and exploit its dominant global position in rare-earth supply chains. The U.S. and other countries face both economic and technological disruptions, though emergency medical and disaster relief exports are exempt. This reflects a broader geopolitical contest over critical minerals, emphasizing the interdependence of the U.S.-China economies and the growing strategic importance of rare-earth metals in global technology and defence.",
