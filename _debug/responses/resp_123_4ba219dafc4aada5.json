  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, who had pleaded guilty to fraud and identity theft charges in 2023, including fabricating his education, career, and personal background. Santos, expelled from the House in 2023, served less than a year in federal prison at FCI Fairton, New Jersey, before being released on October 17, 2025. The commutation, which removes all fines, restitution, and probation conditions, is part of a broader pattern of Trump’s executive clemency for former Republican politicians. Trump justified the decision by comparing Santos’ deception to that of Senator Richard Blumenthal, who misrepresented his military record. The move sparked divided reactions within the Republican Party, with some, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, supporting it as a sign of fairness, while others, such as Nick LaLota, argued it was insufficient given the seriousness of the crimes.",
