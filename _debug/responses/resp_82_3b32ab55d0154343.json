    "A mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, has long puzzled scientists and remains unexplained.",
    "Two main theories exist: the glow could be from pulsars (the remnants of exploded stars), or from annihilations of dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs.",
    "Previously, the glow's shape—matching the galactic bulge—was seen as evidence against the dark matter theory, as dark matter models assumed a spherical distribution.",
    "New supercomputer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter could form a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center, which closely matches the observed glow shape.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008 has long been unexplained. Scientists have proposed two main theories: that it comes from pulsars or from annihilations of dark matter particles, particularly WIMPs. While earlier models suggested the glow's shape matched the galactic bulge—favoring pulsars—new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk show that dark matter could form a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in the galactic center, closely matching the observed glow. This strengthens the dark matter hypothesis, placing a 50% probability in its favor. The study is a significant development in the decades-long quest to identify dark matter, which remains one of physics’ most fundamental mysteries. A new observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to definitively test whether the glow originates from dark matter or pulsars. If confirmed, this would be a groundbreaking discovery, offering potential proof that dark matter consists of WIMPs and resolving a century-old scientific puzzle.",
