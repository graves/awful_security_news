  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has proposed that the Donbas region of Ukraine be 'cut up' and left in Russian hands as a condition for ending the war, shifting U.S. policy from earlier support for Ukraine’s territorial recovery. This comes amid escalating drone attacks: Ukrainian forces struck a major gas processing plant in Russia’s Orenburg region, damaging operations and disrupting gas intake from Kazakhstan; in response, Russia launched attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, including Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, and on the Novokuibyshevsk refinery. Ukraine claims it has also used long-range drones to target Russian facilities, while Russia claims it shot down 45 Ukrainian drones. Trump did not commit to providing Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, contrary to Kyiv’s expectations. The article highlights the deepening of military actions, shifting U.S. diplomatic positions, and the increasing use of long-range weapons in a war that has lasted nearly four years.",
