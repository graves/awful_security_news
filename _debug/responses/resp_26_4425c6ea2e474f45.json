  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—has significantly increased the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to price hikes for roasters and consumers. With the U.S. importing over 99% of its coffee, most of it from Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam, businesses like Swing’s Coffee Roasters, Vigilante Coffee Company, and Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting are struggling with rising bean costs and supply chain disruptions. These cost increases have led to higher prices for coffee in restaurants and cafes, such as a 21% average price increase in August 2025. Consumers are reacting by changing brands or seeking deals, but coffee remains an affordable luxury and consumption habits are not expected to shift dramatically. In response, bipartisan lawmakers like Rep. Don Bacon and Rep. Ro Khanna have introduced the 'No Coffee Tax Act' to exempt coffee products from tariffs. Despite growing uncertainty, roasters are exploring diversification of bean sources to maintain affordability and market stability.",
