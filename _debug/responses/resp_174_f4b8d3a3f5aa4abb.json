  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, sparked by Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s expanded export controls on rare earth metals. China justifies its actions as a defensive measure against U.S. economic and technological targeting, particularly in defense and maritime sectors. The dispute stems from a long history of retaliatory tariffs and export restrictions, including prior actions by both Trump and Biden administrations targeting Chinese technology firms like Huawei and TikTok. Experts highlight that both nations are using national security arguments to justify economic measures, with China appearing more strategically prepared and the U.S. possessing greater economic leverage. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is now under threat, though both sides appear to be maintaining escalation tools in reserve. The situation underscores a global trend of great power competition, where economic interdependence is weaponized, and market reactions will likely determine the trajectory of the conflict.",
