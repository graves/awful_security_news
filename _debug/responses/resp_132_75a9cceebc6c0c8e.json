  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An Associated Press investigation reveals a wave of anti-science legislation introduced across all 50 U.S. states in 2025, driven by advocacy groups closely tied to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. through his 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda. Over 420 bills target public health protections, including vaccines, fluoridation, and milk safety, with more than 2 dozen enacted in 11 states. Key groups such as MAHA Action, the National Vaccine Information Center, and the Weston A. Price Foundation are identified as major supporters, using organized political tactics to influence state lawmakers. Despite claims that their positions are science-based, experts and public health advocates argue that the movement promotes misinformation and undermines proven public health measures. The decline in vaccination rates has led to outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough, and personal tragedies—such as the death of child Liam Dahlberg from Hib—highlight the human cost. The article also notes that many advocates profit from their anti-science stance, linking policy shifts to economic gains, and that the movement reflects a sophisticated, politically strategic effort rather than isolated parental concerns.",
