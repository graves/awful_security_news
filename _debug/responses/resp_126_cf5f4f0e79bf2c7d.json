    "A significant sign of improvement is the birth of four calves by mother whales and shorter intervals between calves among established mothers, indicating improved reproductive health.",
    "Only 11 calves were born this year, which is below researchers' expectations, but the addition of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, which declined by 25% between 2010 and 2020 due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, has shown a positive trend in 2025 with an estimated 384 individuals—up from 376 the previous year. Scientists at the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report a 7% increase since 2020 and improved reproductive signs, including four new births and shorter intervals between calves. These developments are seen as promising, especially with no detected mortalities and fewer injuries. However, conservationists warn that the species remains on the brink of extinction and that ongoing threats, including weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and changes in ocean temperatures forcing whales to travel into dangerous areas, require stronger protections. New management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence have been especially critical to the recovery, and environmental groups urge Congress to uphold existing protections to ensure long-term survival.",
