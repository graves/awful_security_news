  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information, stemming from a 2021 Iranian hack of his AOL email account. Investigators found that he shared over 1,000 pages of personal emails with his wife and daughter, raising questions about whether this violated national security laws. The case, which had been quietly developed for years, gained momentum after President Trump repeatedly urged prosecutors to act, especially following the release of Bolton’s 2020 memoir. While career prosecutors like Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara supported the case, it faced internal resistance due to political pressure and concerns about timing. The case was accelerated after the indictments of other political figures like James and Comey, and ultimately culminated in a swift, private presentation to a federal grand jury. Boltons attorney claims the documents were personal diaries shared only with family and not classified. The case underscores broader concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department and the weaponization of investigations against political critics.",
