  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, a senior member of the British royal family, has been formally asked to give up his royal titles—including the Duke of York—after new emails revealed he maintained contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein beyond what he previously admitted. The revelations, including an email from February 2011 where Andrew stated they were 'in this together,' have fueled accusations of deception and misleading the public. This follows a long history of controversy, including a 2019 BBC interview that failed to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and a 2022 out-of-court settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein. The decision to distance Andrew from the monarchy is being driven by King Charles, who is navigating a delicate period including a state visit to the Vatican, and aligns with Prince William’s vision of a modern, morally responsible institution. Experts and commentators suggest that the move is both symbolic and strategic, aiming to protect the monarchy’s integrity and public trust amid persistent allegations of misconduct and foreign influence.",
