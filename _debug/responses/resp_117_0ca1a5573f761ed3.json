  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two large-scale clinical trials in Europe have demonstrated that a full-spectrum cannabis oil containing THC, CBD, and other compounds significantly outperforms both placebo and opioids in reducing low back pain, with fewer side effects and no signs of addiction. The studies, published in Nature Medicine and involving hundreds of participants, show a 30% average pain reduction in the cannabis group versus 20% in placebo. The results are considered groundbreaking by medical professionals like spine surgeon Richard Price and pain specialist Kevin Boehnke, who see potential for cannabis as a safer, effective alternative to opioids. However, experts like Simon Haroutounian caution that the findings may be specific to the tested compound and not universally applicable. Despite strong evidence, cannabis remains classified as a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S., and FDA approval is pending due to the need for replication in American studies. Vertanical, the German company behind the trials, aims to market its product VER-01 in Europe soon, with U.S. approval potentially years away. Patient advocates emphasize the need for standardized, high-quality, and FDA-approved cannabis products to restore confidence in treatment efficacy and safety.",
