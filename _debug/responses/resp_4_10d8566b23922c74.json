  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula, a former mine worker and public activist, shot Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter, injuring him seriously. The court ruled the act was terrorism, not just a violent attack, citing Cintula’s targeted intent against the Prime Minister. The verdict, delivered by Judge Igor Kralik in Banska Bystrica, reflects deep political and societal divisions in Slovakia, particularly between Fico’s populist, pro-Moscow policies and the liberal, pro-EU opposition. Fico, who has continued in office since the attack, has expressed forgiveness toward Cintula. The case has sparked national debate over political violence, media freedom, democratic standards, and the use of terrorism charges in political confrontations.",
