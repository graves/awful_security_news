  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanut products reduces the risk of peanut allergies, new research shows a significant decline in allergy rates in U.S. children—falling by over 27% after 2015 and over 40% after 2017—due to the adoption of public health guidelines recommending early allergen exposure. Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia analyzed health data showing that about 40,000 children avoided peanut allergies since 2015, with 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists following updated 2017 recommendations. The findings underscore that early exposure to allergens like peanut butter, soy-based yogurts, and milk-based products between 4 and 6 months of age is effective and safe, supported by scientific evidence from the 2015 LEAP trial led by Gideon Lack at King’s College London. Advocacy groups like FARE promote these changes as a meaningful public health opportunity to reduce the prevalence of life-threatening food allergies.",
