  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record, allegedly to smear her after a controversial photo surfaced. The probe follows revelations that Andrew had contact with Jeffrey Epstein in February 2011, where he stated they were 'in this together,' and comes amid ongoing public outrage over his ties to Epstein and the sexual assault allegations against him. Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001 and died by suicide in April 2025, was central to these claims. Though Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 acknowledging her suffering, he continues to deny wrongdoing. Public figures like Ed Miliband have condemned the use of a police officer in a smear campaign, and Giuffre’s family has urged King Charles III to strip Andrew of his royal titles, highlighting deep ethical and political concerns about royal accountability.",
