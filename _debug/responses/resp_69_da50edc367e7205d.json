    "Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and front-runner in the NYC mayoral race, was heavily criticized during the debate for not providing specifics on how he would fund his signature policies—such as freezing rent increases on rent-controlled apartments and making buses free—despite being the top polling candidate.",
    "Mamdani declined to endorse New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a significant departure given that she was one of the first major Democrats to endorse him, signaling a strategic focus on the mayoral race over state-level politics.",
    "Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, claimed that if Mamdani wins, 'Mayor Donald Trump will take over in New York City,' suggesting a belief that federal influence would override municipal leadership.",
    "Mamdani responded by accusing Cuomo of being a 'coward' and criticized his silence on the Department of Justice's indictment of State Attorney General Letitia James, highlighting a major political rift between the candidates.",
    "Sliwa, the Republican nominee, launched a personal attack on Cuomo, citing his father's governance and allegations that the parole board under Cuomo released individuals accused of killing police officers, attempting to position himself as a non-establishment alternative.",
    "Mamdani addressed concerns about antisemitism and criticized the phrase 'globalize the intifada,' stating he does not support any state with racial or religious hierarchies, while affirming support for a ceasefire and denouncing the 'siege, occupation, and apartheid' in Gaza.",
    "Mamdani reiterated his apology for past criticisms of police officers as 'racist' and proposed a Department of Community Safety that would deploy social workers to mental health crises, countering Cuomo’s claim that he would be 'soft on crime'.",
    "Mamdani supports raising taxes on the city’s wealthiest residents, despite Hochul’s opposition, asserting that the campaign’s underdog appeal will generate public support for such a policy, though he lacks the power to implement it independently without state legislative and executive approval.",
    "The debate highlighted a broader political tension over taxation, police reform, school governance, and foreign policy, particularly regarding Israel and Gaza, with Mamdani aligning with opposition to Israeli government actions during the Gaza war."
