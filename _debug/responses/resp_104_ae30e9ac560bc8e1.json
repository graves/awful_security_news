    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and popularized by the American Dialect Society in 2023 and added to Merriam-Webster's dictionary.",
    "Enshittification describes a pattern in which internet platforms, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber, begin with user-friendly experiences and gradually degrade their services to prioritize profit over user value.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (user acquisition with attractive offers), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user's expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization through poor user and merchant treatment).",
    "Doctorow argues that platforms exploit network effects and switching costs to maintain dominance, and that lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight allow this deterioration to continue.",
    "Amazon is cited as an example where sellers lose 45 to 51 cents on every dollar earned due to 'junk fees' and algorithmic manipulation, though Amazon disputes these claims.",
    "Facebook is accused of worsening ad targeting, suppressing content quality, and charging publishers to boost visibility, despite user consent.",
    "Doctorow proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing users to take e-books with them), promoting interoperability (e.g., allowing third-party ink or app compatibility), and reforming antitrust laws to end monopolistic practices.",
    "The article highlights a growing public and policy movement against tech monopolies, even among conservatives, suggesting potential reversal of platform degradation."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces the concept of 'enshittification' — the gradual degradation of internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber — in his new book, arguing that these platforms begin with user-friendly experiences in their early stages but progressively shift to prioritizing profits over user and business value. Doctorow outlines three stages of enshittification: user acquisition with attractive pricing (Stage 1), favoring business customers at user expense (Stage 2), and profit-maximizing exploitation (Stage 3), where platforms impose fees, manipulate algorithms, and suppress fair competition. The article emphasizes that this degradation occurs due to a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight. Doctorow calls for policy changes such as 'right-to-exit' regulations, interoperability, and reform of antitrust laws to reverse the trend. While Amazon and Facebook dispute specific claims, the article reflects a growing public and policy concern about platform monopolies and user exploitation.",
