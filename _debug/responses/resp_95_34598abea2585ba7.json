  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The global effort to implement the world’s first legally binding carbon tax on the shipping industry collapsed during an International Maritime Organization (IMO) summit in October 2025, after the United States, led by former President Donald Trump, launched a fierce campaign against the tax, labeling it a 'scam' and threatening sanctions on supporting countries. While the tax had been approved in 2023 as part of a net zero emissions plan by 2050, the October vote was delayed by 12 months following intense diplomatic pressure. The U.S. used threats of visa restrictions, port blockades, and sanctions to resist the measure, which was supported by the European Union, Brazil, and small island nations like Vanuatu. Experts warn that the failure undermines global climate progress, delays clean shipping innovation, and signals a broader failure in international climate diplomacy—raising concerns about the success of upcoming climate negotiations like COP30 in Belém, Brazil.",
