  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew maintains a 75-year lease on the Grade II-listed Royal Lodge at Windsor, which he secured in 2003 through a financial deal with the Crown Estate. Instead of paying annual rent, he made large upfront payments totaling around £8 million—£5 million for renovations and £2.5 million to buy out future rent obligations—effectively eliminating future rent obligations. The lease requires him to maintain the property, including painting and landscaping, and includes restrictions like no helicopters or gambling. Despite being financially independent due to this arrangement, Prince Andrew remains under public and political scrutiny, especially due to ongoing allegations linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir. The National Audit Office confirmed the arrangement was value for money. The lease will expire in 2078, and his ex-wife and daughters may continue living there. Public figures including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick have called for Prince Andrew to live privately and pay his fair share, reflecting broader concerns about royal accountability and taxpayer costs.",
