    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza is a temporary military boundary established under Donald Trump's peace plan, marking Israel's control over about 53% of the Gaza Strip.",
    "The yellow line is seen by some Israeli newspapers as the 'new border' in Gaza, which aligns with the interests of Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners.",
    "The boundary's construction includes fortifications meant to demarcate territory but may also reflect conflicting expectations between Netanyahu's domestic allies and U.S. officials.",
    "The second stage of the peace plan hinges on resolving Hamas disarming and power transfer issues, with U.S. officials urging restraint to avoid destabilizing the ceasefire.",
    "Netanyahu's response to Hamas violations—initially demanding 'war' and later opting for limited air strikes—shows a balancing act between domestic pressure and U.S. diplomatic influence.",
    "The yellow line may become a de facto border if negotiations fail, potentially enabling new settler expansion and even annexation of Gaza, which would be a major political and geopolitical shift.",
    "Public opinion in Israel favors ending the war and returning hostages and soldiers home, but Netanyahu maintains flexibility by keeping the peace process in stages with caveats.",
    "Washington has shown tolerance for delays and violations, limiting Netanyahu’s political room and forcing a delicate balancing act between domestic and international expectations."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn to a 'yellow line' marking control over about 53% of Gaza, a temporary boundary described by one Israeli newspaper as the 'new border'. This move satisfies Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies but creates tension with U.S. officials who urge restraint and caution against escalation. The second stage of negotiations hinges on Hamas disarmament and power transfer, with U.S. officials like JD Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner pushing for compliance. Israel’s response to Hamas violations—initially calling for war, then resorting to limited air strikes—demonstrates a balancing act between domestic hardline demands and international pressure. The yellow line may become permanent if talks fail, potentially enabling settlement expansion or annexation, raising concerns about the future of Gaza’s status and regional stability.",
