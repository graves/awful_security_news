  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, affecting critical online services such as banking, social media, airline booking, and e-commerce. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services. Although AWS does not frequently face such outages—last occurring in 2021—the event underscores a systemic vulnerability: the internet's heavy dependence on a few centralized cloud providers. Experts warn that this concentration of services creates fragility, as failures in one region or component rapidly cascade across the digital ecosystem. The outage highlights the urgent need for greater redundancy, decentralization, and robustness in internet infrastructure to prevent widespread disruption.",
