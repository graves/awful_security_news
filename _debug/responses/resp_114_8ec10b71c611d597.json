  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has introduced new policies for its AI video tool Sora 2 in response to widespread ethical and legal concerns raised by Hollywood studios, talent agencies, and unions. The tool allows users to generate hyperrealistic audio and video using text prompts, but has been used to create unauthorized, disrespectful, and exploitative contentâ€”such as AI-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr., Robin Williams, and SpongeBob SquarePants. These actions have sparked backlash from performers, their families, and rights organizations, who argue that such content violates consent, dignity, and intellectual property. In response, OpenAI has implemented an opt-in policy, blocked public generation of well-known characters, and agreed to remove existing offensive videos. Industry leaders, including SAG-AFTRA, United Talent Agency, and Creative Artists Agency, have joined forces to support the federal 'NO FAKES Act', which would require consent before digital replicas of people can be used. This marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of AI innovation and creative rights, raising urgent questions about consent, exploitation, and the future of artistic expression.",
