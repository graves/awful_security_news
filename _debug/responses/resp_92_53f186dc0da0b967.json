  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new school superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a controversial mandate introduced by his predecessor, Ryan Walters, that required public schools to place Bibles in classrooms and integrate biblical content into lessons for students in grades 5 through 12. The policy, which drew immediate criticism from civil rights groups and prompted a lawsuit from parents, teachers, and religious leaders, was seen as an attempt to promote religion in public education and combat 'woke ideology.' Fields, appointed by Governor Kevin Stitt, has stated that such decisions should be left to individual school districts and that funding Bibles is not a prudent use of taxpayer money. The state education department is also reviewing other mandates from Walters’ tenure, including a requirement that teacher applicants from California and New York take ideology exams. This development reflects a broader national debate about the role of religion and political ideology in public school curricula.",
