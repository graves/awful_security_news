  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre museum in Paris announced a closure following a highly efficient heist on Sunday, in which armed thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery via a window, stealing royal jewelry including a diadem worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise. The entire operation took just seven minutes, with the robbers exiting on scooters along the Seine. Experts, including French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and art recovery figures like Natalie Goulet and Christopher Marinello, believe the stolen items have likely been taken abroad and sold on the black market or melted down for cash, possibly involving organized crime. The theft has sparked national outrage and renewed debate over museum security, with cultural figures emphasizing its deep symbolic significance as a blow to French heritage. The event echoes past heists such as the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 Corot painting disappearance, reinforcing the fragility of cultural treasures in global museums.",
