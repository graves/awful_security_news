    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure from both domestic far-right allies and U.S. officials to maintain restraint during ceasefire enforcement, especially after Hamas violated the truce by killing two Israeli soldiers.",
    "Netanyahu's coalition, particularly far-right partners, supports a hardline stance, including a one-word demand for 'war' upon Hamas violations, but Israel instead conducted limited air strikes and reinstated the ceasefire to avoid breaking U.S. conditions.",
    "Washington, represented by Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is pushing for stability in negotiations and is urging Netanyahu to show restraint to preserve the peace process.",
    "The second stage of the Trump peace plan hinges on resolving critical issues such as power transfer in Gaza and Hamas disarmament, which remain unresolved and complicate alignment between U.S. and Israeli domestic political agendas.",
    "Netanyahu has stated that war will not end until Hamas is fully dismantled, emphasizing disarmament and demilitarization of Gaza as non-negotiable conditions.",
    "Israeli commentators suggest that real military decisions are increasingly influenced by U.S. policy, indicating a shift in strategic autonomy.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The yellow line, a temporary boundary established under Donald Trump’s peace plan, marks Israel’s control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip and is now central to political tensions between Netanyahu’s domestic far-right coalition and U.S. officials. While Netanyahu’s coalition, especially hardline members, sees the line as a potential de facto border enabling settlement expansion and annexation, U.S. officials—including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner—are pressuring him to maintain ceasefire and restraint, fearing destabilization of the peace process. Hamas’s violation of the ceasefire by killing two soldiers prompted a hardline demand for war from Netanyahu’s National Security Minister, but Israel responded with limited air strikes and reaffirmed the truce to avoid breaking U.S. conditions. The second stage of the Trump plan, which requires Hamas disarmament and power transfer in Gaza, remains unresolved, creating friction between domestic and international expectations. The yellow line may ultimately solidify if negotiations fail, signaling a shift in Israel’s strategic posture and raising concerns about long-term control and settlement expansion in Gaza.",
