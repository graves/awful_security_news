  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live-fire artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate, a major highway in the US. A 155mm shell fired by an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the highway, causing fragments to strike and damage a California Highway Patrol vehicle. Although no injuries were reported, the event raised serious safety concerns, especially as the route had not been used since the 1950s. The Marine Corps has not clarified why the shell exploded or whether a batch defect or manufacturing flaw played a role. The incident occurred amid a broader trend of increased US production of 155mm shells—more than tripling since 2022—driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia. A 2024 Reuters investigation highlighted past issues with shell manufacturing, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive material, which later reverted to TNT for efficiency. The demonstration, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was described by officials as an 'established safe practice,' but experts like retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian noted the premature detonation was abnormal and a failure of expectations, especially given the shell's high trajectory and the public safety risks involved.",
