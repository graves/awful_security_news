  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears while running in the woods near Myoko, Japan, in early October 2025. The attack, which left him with a broken arm and leg injuries requiring multiple surgeries, is part of a broader trend of rising bear attacks in Japan — over 100 injuries and seven deaths reported this year, the highest since 2006. Experts attribute this increase to climate change disrupting traditional bear food sources, leading bears to venture into human habitats. The Japanese government has responded by announcing tougher measures to control bear populations, while residents adopt protective strategies like bear spray and loud noises. Halloran, though traumatized, remains committed to returning to running and nature, expressing gratitude for the support of the local community and awareness of the dangers faced by others in the region.",
