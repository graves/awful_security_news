  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a global call to action to address critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, stressing that nearly half of all countries lack sufficient infrastructure to protect their populations. With over 2 million deaths linked to weather, water, and climate-related disasters in the past 50 years—mostly in developing nations—the urgency is amplified. Despite progress in early warning adoption, 50% of assessed countries still have only basic systems, and the situation is worst in conflict-affected areas. Real-world examples, such as the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten after a predicted glacier collapse in May 2025, demonstrate the life-saving potential of early monitoring and warnings. The WMO emphasizes that early warnings are not just alerts, but tools for empowering communities to act proactively in the face of increasingly severe climate impacts.",
