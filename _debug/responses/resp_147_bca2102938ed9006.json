  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing unusual animal behavior, cloud formations, or using traditional signals like gunfire—is being relied upon to predict and prevent deadly glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite a $37 million investment in early warning systems (EWS) since 2017, many communities lack trust in the technology due to frequent failures, lack of real-time communication, and poor engagement. Cases like that of shepherd Wasiyat Khan, who saved hundreds of lives through timely alerts using traditional methods, demonstrate the effectiveness and cultural continuity of local knowledge. Pakistan, one of the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, faces worsening glacial melt due to rising temperatures (1.3°C since 1950s), increasing the frequency of GLOFs. The government’s failure to build trust and ensure operational functionality of EWS systems has led communities to continue depending on human-based, intergenerational warning systems, which remain the most reliable and immediate form of disaster response in the absence of a functioning technological network.",
