  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A historic preservation group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has called on the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a $200 million, privately funded ballroom. The East Wing, which includes traditional first lady offices and key staff spaces, is being removed despite concerns that the proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would overwhelm the White House and disrupt its classical design. Preservationists argue that such a significant alteration must go through required public review processes, including input from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts—bodies that have historically reviewed past White House changes. The Society of Architectural Historians has echoed these concerns, emphasizing the need for a deliberate and transparent process. While President Trump has publicly supported the project, calling the demolition 'music to my ears,' the White House has not responded to preservationist appeals. The controversy reflects a broader tension between modernizing presidential spaces and maintaining the historical integrity of one of the nation’s most iconic buildings.",
