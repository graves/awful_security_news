Celebrity involvement has also been amplified by the success of the TV show 'Ted Lasso,' which has boosted American interest. Experts note that American ownership has introduced commercial growth, increased investment in women's football, and improved stadium infrastructure. While some fans in Britain express concerns about potential changes to the game, most support American ownership due to modernization and enhanced fan experience. The U.S. audience for British soccer is large, with 40 million fans, and this trend is expected to grow further with the upcoming World Cup hosted in North America.",
