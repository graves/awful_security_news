    "Tropical Storm Melissa is actively developing in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, marking the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season.",
    "Melissa poses a serious flood threat due to heavy rainfall—up to 10 inches in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with potential for over a foot in some areas of Hispaniola, leading to flash flooding and mudslides in mountainous terrain.",
    "The storm’s path is uncertain, with two main scenarios: one involving a northward turn toward Jamaica and western Haiti, and another moving westward toward Central America, potentially impacting Nicaragua or Honduras.",
    "A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in place for Jamaica, indicating immediate threat to these regions.",
    "While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, rough seas and rip currents are possible along the East Coast, and Florida could be affected if Melissa weakens or takes a later northward turn.",
    "Melissa is one of several late-season storms that may intensify rapidly—a trend linked to global warming and rising sea temperatures—similar to recent storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto.",
    "Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, but tropical systems can form beyond that, showing that late-season threats remain possible."
