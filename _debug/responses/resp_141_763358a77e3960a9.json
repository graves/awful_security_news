  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the planet will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerous heat. This is half the increase from the pre-Paris worst-case scenario of 114 days. The study reveals a stark global inequality in heat exposure: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive spikes in superhot days — with Panama projected at 149 extra days — while major emitters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 additional days despite contributing 42% of global CO₂ emissions. Experts warn that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by the rising heat, with thousands dying in heatwaves each year. The findings highlight deep climate injustice and potential geopolitical instability between high-emission and vulnerable nations.",
