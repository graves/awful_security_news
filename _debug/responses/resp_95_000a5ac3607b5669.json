  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, multiple warships, F-35 fighter jets, drones, and intelligence aircraft. Key operations include reopening Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, conducting live-fire training near Venezuela, and flying B-52 bombers within Venezuelan flight information regions. These actions are part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to pressure Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, primarily through a show of force and the capability to conduct remote strikes, rather than an invasion. Experts agree that the buildup signals a strategic pressure campaign aimed at destabilizing Maduro’s government, not an invasion of Venezuela, due to the lack of sufficient force for such an operation and the presence of Venezuelan air defenses.",
