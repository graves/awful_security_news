  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers, a move driven by the Trump administration’s broader strategy to reduce asylum applications and increase deportations. The agreement, which claims to align with international refugee law and human rights principles, includes safeguards such as national vetoes, nationality restrictions, and transfer caps, but faces strong criticism from human rights experts and Belizean opposition leaders who argue that Belize lacks the capacity and infrastructure to properly protect asylum seekers. Critics highlight risks such as abusive prison conditions in countries like Eswatini and El Salvador, and question whether such agreements truly ensure safety or violate international humanitarian law. The deal is part of a larger pattern of US deportation flights to countries including Mexico, Panama, Rwanda, and South Sudan, with some deportees later being returned to their home nations, undermining the premise of safe transfers. Belize’s Senate must still approve the agreement, and ongoing political and humanitarian concerns remain central to its legitimacy and long-term viability.",
