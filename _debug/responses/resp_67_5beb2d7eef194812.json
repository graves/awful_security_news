  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A total of 12 deceased hostages have been identified and returned to Israel from Gaza, including Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Israeli citizen Ronen Engel, following a ceasefire that has now come under increasing strain. The return of bodies, though a step forward, has intensified tensions between Israel and Hamas over allegations of withholding information, using hostages as leverage, and violations of ceasefire terms. The US has warned Hamas of imminent violations, while Israel maintains that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed. Humanitarian access remains blocked at the Rafah crossing, and Israeli military operations, including a deadly strike on a civilian vehicle, have led to civilian deaths, raising serious ethical and compliance concerns. These developments highlight the fragile and contested nature of the ceasefire, with deep implications for regional stability and international diplomacy.",
