The coalition criticizes the U.S. CDC and HHS for political interference in vaccine recommendations, citing false claims by former President Donald Trump and recent changes to childhood immunization schedules—such as the removal of the MMRV vaccine for children under 4. A measles outbreak in South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students underscores the real-world risks of declining vaccination rates. Despite claims from HHS of restoring trust in public health, a KFF poll shows only half of Americans currently trust the CDC with reliable vaccine information. City health officials argue that public health decisions must be grounded in data and science, not ideology, and emphasize the need for coordinated, science-based messaging to protect communities across state lines.",
