  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change will add 57 superhot days per year by 2100, significantly less than the 114 predicted under a 4°C warming scenario, thanks to the Paris Climate Agreement. However, the world has already added 11 superhot days since 2015. The impact is highly uneven: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face massive spikes in dangerous heat—such as 149 extra days in Panama—while the top carbon emitters, including the U.S., China, and India, face only 23–30 extra days despite contributing 42% of global emissions. Experts warn that this disparity reflects deep climate injustice and could exacerbate global tensions between developed and developing nations.",
