  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest have been shelved after a preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was deemed unnecessary, due to growing disagreements over the Donbas region. Russia insists on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas, while Ukraine and European leaders support freezing the current front line as a first step toward peace. Trump’s recent discussions with Putin, including a tense conversation involving demands for territorial concessions, have been criticized by Zelensky as unrealistic. The only topic that has prompted Russia to engage in talks is the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which Zelensky sees as a significant diplomatic breakthrough despite no concrete outcomes. The White House’s decision may reflect a strategic retreat from a high-stakes summit, avoiding another failed meeting like the one in Alaska.",
