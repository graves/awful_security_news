Moynihan was previously pardoned by President Donald Trump as part of a blanket pardon of January 6 defendants. Despite the pardon, he remains in prison pending trial on a terroristic threat charge, with prosecutors citing a history of drug abuse and increased homicidal ideation. The case highlights growing concerns about political violence and threats against public officials, especially in the wake of high-profile assassinations such as that of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.
