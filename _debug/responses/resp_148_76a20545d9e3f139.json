  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have confirmed that there are no plans for a Trump-Putin summit in the near future, following initial expectations sparked by a phone call between the two leaders in October. The US and Russia have cited conflicting demands—Trump advocating for a ceasefire by freezing battle lines, while Russia insisting on control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and dismantling Ukrainian military capabilities—as key reasons for the delay. A phone call between US Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has been held, but no in-person meeting is now necessary. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders have criticized Russia’s persistent stalling, arguing that only Ukraine is committed to peace. The situation underscores a deep divergence in ceasefire strategies, with Trump and allies pushing for a pause in hostilities, while Russia maintains hardline demands that are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.",
