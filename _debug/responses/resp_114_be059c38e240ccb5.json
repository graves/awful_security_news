Solicitor General D. John Sauer asserts that federal personnel are at risk and that the President has the authority to deploy troops to protect federal interests in Chicago. This marks the first time the Supreme Court has been asked to review such a deployment. The request comes amid broader legal challenges across cities including Los Angeles, Memphis, and Portland, where the administration has previously attempted to send troops to address protests and crime, often without state consultation. Critics, including governors and attorneys general, argue that these actions exceed presidential authority and endanger civil liberties. The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond by Monday evening, signaling a pivotal moment in the federal-state power struggle over military intervention in civilian governance.",
