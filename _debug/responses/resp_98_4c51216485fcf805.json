    "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending 19 years of left-wing rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS).",
    "Paz received 54.5% of the vote, while Quiroga received 45.5%, according to early results from Bolivia’s electoral tribunal.",
    "Paz’s Christian Democratic Party does not hold a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building for effective governance.",

    "Both candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with the United States and seek US-backed financial support, with Paz unveiling a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with US officials.",
    "Paz’s platform emphasizes gradual reform: tax incentives for small businesses, regional fiscal autonomy, and a shift from state-led to market-driven growth.",
    "Paz plans to phase out universal fuel subsidies, replacing them with targeted support for vulnerable groups and market rates for large industries.",
    "His running mate, Edman Lara—a former police officer with a populist TikTok presence—helped boost voter engagement, especially among younger and working-class demographics.",
    "The incoming government faces immediate economic challenges, including securing fuel supplies and managing opposition from labor unions like the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), which opposes any threat to social programs.",
    "Paz’s party (PDC) won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, narrowly ahead of Quiroga’s coalition (43 seats in lower house, 12 in Senate).",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of left-wing rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. The election, driven by Bolivia’s severe economic crisis—characterized by high inflation, declining natural gas exports, and fuel shortages—has sparked a significant political shift. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, but his party lacks a legislative majority, forcing him to form coalitions. His platform emphasizes gradual reform, including tax incentives for small businesses and regional fiscal autonomy, while aiming to shift from a state-led to a market-driven economy. Both candidates pledged to improve relations with the United States and seek financial support, with Paz unveiling a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal through populist digital outreach. Despite the victory, challenges remain, including securing fuel supplies, phasing out subsidies, and managing opposition from labor unions such as the COB, which fears erosion of social gains. The new administration officially begins on November 8, signaling a transformative moment in Bolivia’s political and economic trajectory.",
