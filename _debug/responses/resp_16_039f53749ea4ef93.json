  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists have re-examined the mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, originally detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008. While pulsars were a leading explanation, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk suggest that dark matter — specifically, WIMPs — could produce a squashed, egg-shaped distribution of gamma rays that closely matches the observed glow. This would support the dark matter theory, which had previously been challenged by the glow’s shape. Though experts remain cautious, the findings increase the likelihood that dark matter may be responsible, with a 50% probability compared to older stellar explanations. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), scheduled to begin operations in 2027, will provide higher-resolution data to definitively confirm or rule out the dark matter hypothesis, marking a critical step in solving one of physics’ most enduring mysteries.",
