  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the growing issue of 'stay-or-pay' agreements, where employees may be required to repay employers for benefits like on-the-job training, signing bonuses, or tuition reimbursement if they leave a job before a set retention period. These agreements, especially known as TRAPs, are criticized as exploitative and limiting employee mobility, particularly in lower-wage industries like healthcare, transportation, and retail. While historically used in high-skilled fields like engineering and aviation, their use has expanded. The article highlights a significant policy shift: California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law banning repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprenticeships) and for benefits when workers are laid off without cause, with the law taking effect on January 1, 2026. The law allows limited retention bonuses and tuition reimbursement for transferable credentials, with repayment prorated and stay periods capped at two years. The move is welcomed by labor advocates like the California Nurses Association, who argue such agreements restrict worker freedom and discourage better job opportunities. Other states, like New York, have introduced similar legislation, suggesting a broader national trend toward stronger employee protections.",
