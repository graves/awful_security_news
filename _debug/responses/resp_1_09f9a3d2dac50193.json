  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses significant threats to Hispaniola, especially the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where heavy rainfall—potentially exceeding one foot—could trigger dangerous flash floods and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may receive rainfall, though not a direct hit. While a direct landfall on the mainland U.S. is unlikely, rough surf and rip currents are possible along the East Coast, with Florida being a potential secondary impact zone. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean Sea, where warm waters are fueling storm development. This intensification trend aligns with broader climate change patterns, as three prior storms (Erin, Gabrielle, Humberto) have already undergone extreme rapid intensification. The storm's path remains uncertain, with two primary scenarios: one involving a northward turn toward Hispaniola and another moving west toward Central America. As Melissa continues to develop, its track, strength, and impacts will become clearer.",
