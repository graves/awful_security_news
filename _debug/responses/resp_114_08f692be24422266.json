  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a closely contested gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite the state’s historically blue political leanings. The race is marked by personal attacks, including claims that Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation and accusations that Ciattarelli’s company downplayed opioid dangers, leading to a defamation threat. National figures like former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump are actively involved, with Obama endorsing Sherrill and Trump endorsing Ciattarelli. The campaign centers on affordability, with both candidates addressing rising energy and property taxes. Experts note that New Jersey has a long history of electing governors from both parties, making this a uniquely purple race. Voter concerns over cost of living appear to be more influential than personal attacks, and the race could result in the first three-term consecutive governor from the same party since the 1960s if Sherrill wins.",
