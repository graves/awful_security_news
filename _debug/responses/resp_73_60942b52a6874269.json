  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has issued a strong public endorsement of vaccination in response to growing misinformation and political interference from federal officials. The coalition criticizes the CDC and HHS for recent policy changes and false claims—such as those made by President Donald Trump—about vaccine safety and dosing, which have contributed to declining public trust and rising measles outbreaks. A measles outbreak in upstate South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students highlights the real-world risks of low vaccination rates, while the coalition emphasizes that vaccines protect schools, families, and communities. Multiple medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have diverged from CDC guidance, adding to public health confusion. The article underscores that public health decisions must be science-based, not politically driven, and calls for stronger local coordination to protect public safety across jurisdictional boundaries.",
