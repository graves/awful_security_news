  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A White House proposal offering expanded federal funding to select universities in exchange for ideological reforms—such as eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions and capping international student enrollment—has been rejected by seven major institutions, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and Dartmouth. These rejections stem from deep concerns that the compact would compromise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding. The White House claims the compact promotes a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and offers competitive advantages in federal grants and partnerships, but universities argue that tying funding to ideological compliance undermines innovation and free inquiry. The proposal, initially sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, now includes 12 schools, with a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories. While the University of Texas at Austin expressed openness to the offer, others, including Vanderbilt, have maintained a position of dialogue or non-acceptance. The growing resistance highlights a national debate over federal influence in higher education and the preservation of academic independence.",
