  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown a positive trend, increasing to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025, up from 376 in 2024. This recovery follows a 25% decline from 2010 to 2020 due to ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA attribute the recent growth to improved conservation measures, including new regulations in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. Despite only 11 calves being born this year—below researchers' expectations—four mother whales produced calves, and some established mothers are having shorter intervals between births, indicating improved reproductive health. Experts remain cautious, noting that the population is still vulnerable and that continued threats from maritime activity and climate-driven habitat shifts could endanger recovery. Environmental advocates, including Gib Brogan of Oceana, emphasize the importance of upholding the Marine Mammal Protection Act and urge Congress to protect existing safeguards.",
