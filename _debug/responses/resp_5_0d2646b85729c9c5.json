  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans, including combat veterans Michael and Jake Pannell, are raising alarms over the VA’s recent policy of limiting one-on-one therapy sessions, which was intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins starting in early 2021. While the VA claims care is patient-centered and collaborative, mental health providers report being pressured to terminate therapy prematurely, even for patients with chronic conditions like PTSD. Providers face disciplinary actions for challenging these limits, and some have resigned out of frustration. Veterans express feelings of abandonment and re-traumatization, citing a lack of trust and continuity in care. The American Psychological Association has acknowledged reports and is investigating. Critics argue that short-term, fixed-session models are clinically inappropriate for many veterans, especially those with long-term mental health needs, and that such policies undermine recovery and trust. The VA denies any systemic limits on appointments, but providers and patients say implementation is inconsistent and harmful.",
