  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been convicted of criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 election campaign and will begin serving a five-year prison sentence on Tuesday, October 20, 2025, at Paris’ La Santé prison. The court ruled that he must begin serving the sentence immediately due to the seriousness of the offense and its disruption to public order, bypassing appeal procedures. Despite maintaining his innocence, Sarkozy has expressed defiance, stating he will remain resolute and hold his head high. He may be held in a special 'vulnerable' section with a 9-square-meter cell and limited privileges, though former inmates like Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany suggest that even a former president will face the shock and loss of status typical of incarceration. The prison, historically known for housing figures like Captain Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal, will now host Sarkozy, marking a historic moment as the first former French president to serve a prison sentence in modern times. His family, including wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and son Louis, has shown public support, and he will be allowed to bring personal items such as 10 family photos and three books, including 'The Count of Monte Cristo'.",
