  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season, the Detroit Lions defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a dominant performance, fueled by a breakout game from running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who recorded 218 total yards and two touchdowns—his best of the season and the most by a Lions player since Calvin Johnson’s 2013 game. Meanwhile, star wide receiver Mike Evans suffered a season-ending broken clavicle during the game, ending his 11-season streak of 1,000+ receiving yards and leaving Tampa Bay’s offense severely depleted. In the other Monday Night Football game, the Seattle Seahawks overcame the Houston Texans in a tightly contested 27-19 win, with standout performance from rookie wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who recorded 123 receiving yards and a touchdown and now leads the NFL in receiving yards. The article highlights both a rising star in the running back position and a major injury to a key wide receiver, underscoring the volatility and unpredictability of the NFL season.",
