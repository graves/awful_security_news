  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House began demolishing part of the East Wing in October 2025 to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal body that oversees major renovations. President Donald Trump claims the project is privately funded by donors and business leaders, with a target completion date of January 2029. The demolition disrupts the traditional operations of the first ladyâ€™s offices, which will be temporarily relocated. While Trump insists the new ballroom respects the original structure and is not touching the main building, the project raises questions about regulatory compliance and the precedent of executive overreach in federal construction. Carrier Global Corp. has donated a world-class HVAC system, and the White House has not yet disclosed full donor information. The construction, which began in September with site prep and tree clearing, represents the largest structural change to the White House since the 1948 addition of the Truman Balcony.",
