  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year-long program of housing Chinese giant pandas, with Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji departing for China in 2025. This marks the end of a diplomatic initiative that began in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China, symbolizing the thaw of U.S.-China relations. The program, known as 'panda diplomacy,' involved loaning pandas to U.S. zoos for public engagement and political outreach, with China retaining ownership and receiving financial contributions for conservation. As U.S.-China relations have deteriorated, including due to viral claims of panda abuse, the program has declined. Only Xin Xin in Mexico City remains as the last panda in the Americas. Zoo Atlanta, the only other U.S. zoo with pandas, will lose its bears in 2025 as their contract expires. While China continues its panda diplomacy with countries like Russia and Qatar, the U.S. is losing its key presence. The National Zoo is preparing renovations for the vacant exhibit and remains hopeful for future panda returns, with public hope tied to future first ladies like Jill Biden.",
