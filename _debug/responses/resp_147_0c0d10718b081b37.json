  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a urgent call for global expansion of early-warning systems to combat the rising threat of extreme weather events driven by climate change. Despite progress in early warning adoption, nearly half of all countries still lack adequate systems, with 90% of disaster-related deaths occurring in developing nations. Real-world examples, such as the successful evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a predicted glacier collapse in May 2025, demonstrate the life-saving potential of early warnings. The article highlights widespread extreme weather in 2025—floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea; wildfires in southern Europe and the US—emphasizing that no region is spared. The WMO stresses that early warning is not just about alerts, but about enabling early action, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected areas, where systems are most urgently needed.",
