  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown in October 2025, the White House announced it would redirect tariff revenue — specifically from Section 32 funds intended for child nutrition — to sustain the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision follows Congress’s failure to pass a funding bill for fiscal year 2026, threatening to cut off WIC operations. The move was framed by the White House as a necessary and creative response to protect vulnerable families, though legal experts and advocacy groups express concern over transparency, funding stability, and the lack of congressional appropriation. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it emphasized uncertainty around funding amounts, disbursement timelines, and long-term viability. The administration’s plan leverages existing tariff collections — which have reached $190 billion so far — to avoid program collapse, but its legality remains under scrutiny. The situation underscores broader concerns about how political gridlock impacts essential public services, with bipartisan figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson criticizing Democratic leaders for deepening the crisis.",
