  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Baek Se-hee, a South Korean author born in 1990, died at age 35 after writing two deeply personal memoirs that explore her struggle with dysthymia and depression. Her first memoir, 'I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki,' became a bestseller in South Korea in 2018 and gained international acclaim after being translated into English in 2022, appearing on the Sunday Times Bestsellers List and receiving a New York Times recommendation. The book's honest portrayal of mental health challenges, including the contrast between suicidal thoughts and simple pleasures like tteokbokki, helped reduce stigma and foster open dialogue about therapy and emotional well-being. Baek also wrote a follow-up memoir in 2019 detailing her ongoing battle with chronic depression. After her death, she donated her heart, lungs, liver, and both kidneys, saving five lives, and her legacy continues through both her literary contributions and her compassionate acts. Tributes from her sister and translator underscore her impact as a writer and a person who inspired millions with her honesty and hope.",
