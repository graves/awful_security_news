  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major AWS outage on Monday, beginning at 07:11 GMT in Virginia, was triggered by a human error during a software update to DynamoDB’s API, which caused a DNS failure. This cascaded into failures across 113 AWS services, affecting global platforms such as banking apps (Venmo, Coinbase), social media (Snapchat, Pinterest), gaming (Fortnite, Roblox), communication apps (WhatsApp, Zoom), media services (The New York Times, ESPN), and smart home devices (Ring, Alexa). Experts confirmed the incident was not a cyberattack but a result of routine technical error. AWS restored services by 10:11 GMT and acknowledged the issue, with engineers working in parallel to resolve it. The event underscores the immense dependency of modern digital life—ranging from finance to entertainment and personal technology—on centralized cloud infrastructure.",
