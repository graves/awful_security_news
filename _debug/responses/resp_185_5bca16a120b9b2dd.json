  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has confirmed the return of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed on 7 October 2023, as the 10th dead hostage to be recovered from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insist that Hamas must return all remaining bodies in line with the ceasefire agreement, citing concerns over Hamas's failure to do so. Hamas attributes the delay to Israeli strikes that have destroyed infrastructure and blocked access for recovery operations. The UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, described Gaza as a 'wasteland' with widespread destruction and urgent humanitarian needs. The US, through its special envoy Steve Witkoff, has expressed concern over Israel’s actions, particularly a strike in Qatar that affected Hamas's underground operations and damaged diplomatic trust. As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel released over 1,700 Palestinian detainees, but the unresolved issue of body recovery remains a point of tension. Meanwhile, the Gaza Civil Defence reported that a recent IDF strike in the Zeitoun neighborhood killed 11 people, adding to the humanitarian crisis. The situation underscores the ongoing struggle between military operations, humanitarian needs, and diplomatic negotiations.",
