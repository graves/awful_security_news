  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has publicly objected to President Donald Trump using his performance of the song 'Danger Zone' in a fake AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, which shows Trump in a fighter jet with the slogan 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protesters in Times Square. The video, posted in response to the 'No Kings' protests, features music from the 1986 film 'Top Gun' and has drawn criticism from artists who argue that political misuse of music divides Americans. Although such use is generally legal under copyright law, performers and songwriters can prohibit use in campaign advertisements, and many choose to make public objections. Loggins specifically requests removal of his recording, citing the need for national unity. The White House did not directly respond but shared a 'Top Gun' film still. Other musicians, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, have previously filed lawsuits against Trump over similar issues, with the Hayes case still ongoing.",
