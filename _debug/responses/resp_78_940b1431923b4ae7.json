  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Republican New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa is facing intense pressure to withdraw from the race, with his boss John Catsimatidis and former Governor Andrew Cuomo urging him to step aside. Catsimatidis, a lifelong New Yorker and media magnate, directly called on Sliwa to prioritize New York City over personal ambition. Cuomo, running as an independent, positions himself as a moderate alternative to the Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and claims Sliwa is not a viable candidate. Sliwa responds by emphasizing his representation of blue-collar working-class voters and rejecting claims that the race is being dictated by billionaire donors. President Donald Trump also dismisses Sliwa, calling him 'not exactly primetime' and mocking his affinity for cats. Despite criticism, Sliwa remains committed to the campaign, with allies suggesting coordination between Mamdani and Sliwa, though Mamdani denies it. The article highlights the fractured Republican strategy, media influence, and growing tensions among candidates over voter representation and political legitimacy.",
