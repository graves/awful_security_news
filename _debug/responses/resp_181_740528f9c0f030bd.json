  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has been able to afford his residence at Royal Lodge through a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate that required him to pay substantial upfront payments totaling around £8 million for renovations and future rent obligations, effectively eliminating annual rent. Despite the lease including maintenance responsibilities and prohibitions on helicopters and gambling, the arrangement has come under intense scrutiny due to Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein and new allegations from Virginia Giuffre’s memoir. The National Audit Office confirmed the deal was financially sound, but political figures including Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick have criticized the arrangement, calling for Prince Andrew to live privately and pay his fair share. The lease, set to end in 2078, includes provisions allowing Prince Andrew’s ex-wife and daughters to remain in the property after his departure, and the financial return for early termination has been reduced over time, with nearly zero return by 2028.",
