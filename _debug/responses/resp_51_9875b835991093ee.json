  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Electricity bills are rising across the U.S. due to a surge in demand from AI-powered data centers, fueled by massive investments from tech giants like Meta and Microsoft. The AI boom — including partnerships like OpenAI and Broadcom's 10 gigawatt AI chip project — is driving up energy consumption, with data centers projected to consume 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Experts from the EIA, DOE, Gartner, and academic institutions confirm that this growth, combined with outdated pricing models, is contributing to higher residential costs. While some regions like Oregon are trying to mitigate the impact by requiring data centers to pay for grid strain, the overall trend reflects a significant and systemic shift in energy demand due to artificial intelligence development.",
