  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article exposes the exploitative working conditions in Guatemalan garment factories, known as maquilas, where workers—mostly women—face long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite Guatemala's role as a major apparel supplier to US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, these companies are not legally accountable for labor abuses. Korean-owned factories dominate the sector, with nearly two-thirds of investments controlled by such companies. Workers report being forced to produce thousands of garments daily, with minimal pay and no job security. Union activity is severely suppressed, with threats of violence and firings, including the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Labor inspectors are blocked from entering factories, and workers often lose pensions and severance when factories close. The Guatemalan government under President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced reforms, such as a 6% wage increase, but enforcement remains weak. The article underscores how global fashion supply chains enable labor exploitation, and how women workers, especially in marginalized communities, face systemic abuse, lack of protection, and a future of financial and psychological instability.",
