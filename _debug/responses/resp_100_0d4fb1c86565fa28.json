  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions on international humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank by banning the UNRWA from sending aid and staff, and by introducing a new registration process for non-governmental organizations (INGOs) that requires approval from a committee including Israeli government representatives. The new rules, which cite ideological reasons such as 'supporting terrorist groups' or 'inciting racism,' have been used to deny re-registration to major aid groups like the Norwegian Refugee Council and Mercy Corps. Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that pledged increased aid, Israel continues to block most border crossings, allowing only two of seven crossings to remain open. Hundreds of aid trucks have been stranded in Egypt and Jordan for months, and humanitarian officials warn that the restrictions are not about security but about politically motivated de-registration. The situation threatens to deepen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where over 90% of homes have been destroyed and the population faces famine-level food insecurity. International actors, including the U.S. and EU, have expressed skepticism about Israel's claims against UNRWA, and the global humanitarian community is concerned about the erosion of neutral, effective aid delivery mechanisms in one of the world’s most devastated regions.",
