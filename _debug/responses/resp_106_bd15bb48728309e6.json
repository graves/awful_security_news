  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Missouri, a growing backlash is forming against a new congressional map that has been widely criticized as gerrymandered, particularly by targeting the Kansas City district of longtime Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II. A grassroots campaign led by People Not Politicians Missouri, with over 3,000 volunteers including Leann Villaluz, is attempting to force a voter referendum by gathering over 106,000 signatures. The group argues that redistricting dilutes voter representation and that Missourians deserve a say in shaping their congressional boundaries. However, the state’s Attorney General and Secretary of State have challenged the referendum, claiming constitutional violations or improper signature collection. Legal challenges, including one led by progressive candidate Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan, argue that mid-decade redistricting without a census is unconstitutional and harmful to local communities. While the Republican-led legislature passed the map, 15 Republican lawmakers—including Bill Allen and Jon Patterson—oppose it, emphasizing that representatives must serve their districts. The Democratic National Committee is supporting the effort, and the broader national context shows that Missouri is part of a trend driven by President Trump’s redistricting initiative, with multiple states poised to follow. If the referendum succeeds, it would delay the map until voters decide in 2026.",
