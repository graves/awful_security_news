  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in March 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and arsenic, and using tetrahydrozoline from eyedrops to cause fatal cardiac failure. The case reveals a detailed premeditated plan that began with online research and purchases of poisons, including arsenic, potassium cyanide, and oleandrin, which were used in meals and medications. Craig’s actions were supported by evidence such as search histories on a dental office computer, deliveries of toxic substances, and altered prescriptions. Key employees, including office manager Caitlin Romero and business partner Dr. Ryan Redfearn, raised concerns and reported suspicious behavior, contributing to the investigation. The timeline, which spans from February to March 2023, shows a pattern of escalating poisoning, with Angela’s symptoms worsening over time. The case is significant for demonstrating how everyday products can be weaponized for murder and underscores the importance of workplace vigilance and toxicology expertise in identifying such crimes.",
