  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified its military campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, using hundreds of modified drones and missiles to strike key power and gas facilities, including Thermal Station 5 in Kyiv. The October 10, 2025 attack caused widespread power and water outages for nearly four million people, while also marking a shift in tactics: drones now fly at higher altitudes and missiles are software-modified to evade Western air defenses, reducing interception rates from 37% to 6%. These attacks, which have continued since 2022, are strategically timed to exploit the upcoming harsh winter, leaving civilians defenseless. Corruption in Ukraine’s anti-drone defense spending has further weakened infrastructure protection, with officials and soldiers implicated in fraudulent schemes. Despite public warnings and emergency measures—like residents buying power banks, gas canisters, and wood stoves—Ukraine’s energy systems are critically damaged and appear close to collapse, raising concerns about a severe winter with widespread blackouts and civilian hardship.",
