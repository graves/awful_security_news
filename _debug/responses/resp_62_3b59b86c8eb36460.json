    "A mysterious diffuse glow of gamma rays at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, has led scientists to speculate about its source, with two leading theories being pulsars and dark matter collisions.",
    "Historically, the glow’s shape matched the galactic bulge, a region rich in old stars and pulsars, which favored the pulsar explanation, but recent supercomputer simulations show that dark matter could also form a bulge-shaped distribution.",
    "New simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues, published in Physical Review Letters, suggest that dark matter in the Milky Way may have a squashed, egg-shaped distribution in its core, closely matching the observed gamma-ray glow.",
    "The 50% probability that the glow is due to dark matter — compared to old stars — represents a significant shift in the scientific debate and increases the credibility of the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate in 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively confirm or reject the dark matter link.",
    "WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), a leading dark matter candidate, are theorized to annihilate and produce gamma rays when they collide — a mechanism that could explain the observed glow.",
    "Despite decades of effort, dark matter has never been directly observed, and its nature remains one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in physics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has long puzzled scientists, with competing theories pointing to either pulsars or dark matter. While earlier evidence favored pulsars due to the glow’s shape resembling the galactic bulge, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk show that dark matter could form a similarly shaped distribution due to its non-spherical, squashed core. This increases the plausibility of dark matter — particularly WIMPs — as the source. The study, published in Physical Review Letters, suggests a 50% chance that the glow stems from dark matter. However, confirmation remains pending, with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to launch in 2027, offering high-resolution data to definitively resolve the mystery. Despite decades of search, dark matter remains one of physics’ greatest enigmas, and this development reinvigorates the possibility that WIMPs could be revealing themselves in space.",
