    "China has tightened export controls on 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), bringing the total to 12 restricted metals from a list of 12.",
    "The restrictions also apply to specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, with most effective from December 1, 2025.",
    "Foreign companies must obtain special approvals from China, detailing the intended use of products containing rare-earth metals, especially those with 0.1% or more heavy rare-earth content.",
    "China cites national security and proliferation risks, citing direct or indirect transfer of controlled rare-earth materials for military use by foreign entities.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports coming from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are vital for critical technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, radar systems, AI semiconductors, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer (60% mined) and processor (90% processed) of rare-earth metals, giving it significant strategic leverage.",
    "The move is seen as a strategic signal ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting during the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting China is using its supply dominance to strengthen its negotiating position.",
    "While emergency medical needs, disaster relief, and public health responses are exempt, the restrictions impact broad industrial and technological supply chains.",
    "Analysts, including CSIS and University of Montana experts, view this as a classic act of 'pre-meeting choreography' designed to signal China’s willingness to weaponize its supply chain dominance."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—adding five new ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to a prior list—and restricted access to refining equipment. These measures, effective from December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to justify the use of rare-earth materials, especially in military or sensitive applications. China cites national security concerns and proliferation risks, noting foreign entities have transferred or processed materials for military use. The US, the world’s largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, faces significant disruptions in defence (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, missiles) and civilian technology (e.g., EVs, AI, medical devices). Analysts interpret the move as a strategic signal ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, demonstrating China’s leverage in trade negotiations and its ability to disrupt US industrial and technological capacity. Despite exemptions for emergency medical and disaster relief, the restrictions underscore the global interdependence and strategic competition over critical supply chains.",
