  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the 2025 U.S. government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue—normally allocated to child nutrition programs—to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable families. This decision follows a funding lapse as Congress failed to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it expressed deep concern over uncertainty regarding the amount, speed, and duration of funding. Legal experts, including Chris Towner, raised questions about the legality of redirecting tariff revenue without congressional appropriation. The move reflects broader political tensions, with House Speaker Mike Johnson blaming Democrats for the shutdown and framing WIC as a victim of partisan inaction. The article highlights both the urgency of sustaining essential social programs and the constitutional and procedural challenges of executive action during a legislative deadlock.",
