  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective weapon used in conflicts across Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan, remains a strategic option for Ukraine to conduct long-range strikes deep inside Russia. Despite its proven combat history and high precision, Ukraine currently cannot access Tomahawk missiles due to the lack of a ground-launch system like the Typhon, which is essential for launching the missile from land. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for the delivery of Tomahawks to strike key Russian infrastructure, such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov, to pressure Russia into negotiations. However, the US has limited stock and President Trump has emphasized that Tomahawks are needed for American security, delaying their supply to Ukraine. Russia has responded with alarm, warning that such a supply would be seen as a hostile act threatening global security. While Ukraine’s domestically developed Flamingo missile is being considered, its capabilities remain unclear and production is not scalable. Ultimately, even a few dozen Tomahawks could inflict significant damage, but Ukraine’s primary military need remains robust air defenses against Russian missile and drone attacks.",
