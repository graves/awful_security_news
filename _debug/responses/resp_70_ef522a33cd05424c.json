  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the beating death of inmate Robert Brooks, who was attacked three times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024. The incident, captured on silent body-camera footage showing guards assaulting Brooks without concern, prompted widespread public outrage and led to a jury conviction. Two other guards, Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of murder charges despite being charged with involvement in the assault. The case is part of a broader investigation into systemic violence in state prisons, with the Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick leading the prosecution after Attorney General Letitia James recused herself. Fitzpatrick is also prosecuting guards in the separate killing of inmate Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility. Six of the ten guards indicted have been charged with murder or manslaughter, with several pleading guilty or agreeing to reduced charges, highlighting ongoing accountability efforts.",
