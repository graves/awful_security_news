  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, sparked by China’s expansion of export controls on rare earth metals in response to US trade restrictions. The US, under President Donald Trump, retaliated with a threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, signaling a potential escalation of a trade war that could disrupt global supply chains. This confrontation follows a long history of tariff wars, including previous cycles under Trump and Biden, where both nations used national security arguments to justify economic actions. China justifies its restrictions as necessary for national security, while the US accuses China of double standards and discriminatory practices. Experts note that both sides are strategically using economic tools to gain leverage, particularly ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea. The article underscores how the conflict reflects a broader great power struggle, where economic interdependence is weaponized, and the outcome hinges on market reactions, diplomatic negotiations, and each nation’s ability to absorb economic pain.",
