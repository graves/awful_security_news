  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eileen Collins, the first woman to pilot and command a NASA spacecraft, made history during the Space Shuttle era by overcoming gender barriers and leading through two major disasters—the Challenger and Columbia tragedies. Her leadership during the 2005 mission, when a foam shedding incident threatened the shuttle, required her to execute a risky 360-degree flip to inspect the spacecraft's heat shield, a feat that underscored her courage and technical skill. Despite being a mother and balancing personal and professional responsibilities, Collins remained committed to being a strong, confident leader. Now, a documentary titled 'Spacewoman' brings her remarkable journey to public attention, emphasizing her legacy as a trailblazer for women in space and science.",
