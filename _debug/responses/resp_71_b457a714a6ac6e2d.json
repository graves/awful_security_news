    "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, citing a 'harrowing pre-planned ambush' involving multiple attackers and threats to federal personnel.",
    "Lower federal courts, including the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, have previously blocked the deployment, arguing that Trump overstated the emergency and that such decisions should be subject to judicial review.",
    "The administration relies on the 1827 Supreme Court case *Martin v. Mott*, which established that the president alone has the authority to determine whether a national emergency exists, and that courts cannot review such decisions.",
    "Opposing state and local officials challenge this view, citing the 1932 case *Sterling v. Constantin*, which held that courts can review executive decisions if they fall outside a 'range of honest judgment'.",
    "The Trump administration claims that lower courts are improperly interfering with the president's commander-in-chief powers and military chain of command.",
    "The Supreme Court, which has historically deferred to presidential authority in security matters, is now being asked to rule on whether it can review presidential decisions to deploy the National Guard on U.S. soil.",
    "The case centers on the legal definition of a 'national emergency' and the balance of power between the executive branch and the judiciary."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, claiming that federal personnel are under imminent threat from a pre-planned ambush involving multiple assailants. This move follows a temporary block by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Trump overstated the emergency. The administration cites the 1827 case *Martin v. Mott* to assert that only the president can determine if a national emergency exists and that courts cannot review such decisions. Opposing parties argue that the 1932 case *Sterling v. Constantin* permits judicial review when executive actions go beyond reasonable judgment. The case raises critical questions about the balance of power between the executive and judiciary, particularly regarding presidential authority to deploy federal troops on U.S. soil during protests, and the Supreme Court has responded with a rapid request for state and local input, signaling high urgency.",
