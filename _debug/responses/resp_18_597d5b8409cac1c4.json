  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo on October 15, 2025, requiring prior approval from the Pentagon’s Office of Legislative Affairs for all interactions between Defense Department personnel—including military commanders and combatant commanders—and Congress. The policy aims to ensure messaging consistency and prevent conflicting statements that could undermine legislative goals, but critics argue it is overly restrictive and impractical given the volume of routine engagements. While the policy is rooted in a 2006 directive and intended to improve coordination, it has sparked concern over reduced transparency and communication between the Pentagon and Congress. A working group led by Assistant Secretary Dane Hughes will assess the current engagement model and propose reforms. The policy marks a notable escalation in Hegseth’s efforts to control information flow, following earlier restrictions on think tank engagements and reporter access.",
