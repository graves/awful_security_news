Volunteers such as Ruby, Ivan, and Cristóbal Cavazos patrol neighborhoods, use non-aggressive tactics like whistles and loud noises to deter ICE agents, and warn residents of suspicious activity. They provide critical information about rights, such as refusing to sign documents without legal representation, and help people evade detention. Residents report growing fear, with many choosing not to send children to school or go to work. In response, federal agents have used aggressive tactics, including tear gas during protests, prompting accusations from the Trump administration that these groups interfere with law enforcement. Despite the risks and fear, community activists continue their work to protect their neighbors and defend free speech and the right to protest.",
