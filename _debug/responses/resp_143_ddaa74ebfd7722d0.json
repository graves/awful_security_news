  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and Ghizer, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as observing animal behavior, unusual weather patterns, and using traditional signals like gunfire or fire—to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), such as the $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017, these systems have failed to gain trust due to malfunctioning equipment, lack of maintenance, and poor communication with local populations. Residents have reported that warnings are often issued by local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, who use time-tested, human-based methods that have successfully saved lives. The article underscores Pakistan’s status as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, with rising temperatures and glacier melt accelerating disaster frequency. It highlights a broader global challenge: that technology alone cannot ensure safety without community trust, cultural relevance, and effective implementation. As Pakistan faces more frequent and severe GLOFs, the integration of Indigenous knowledge into climate adaptation strategies is emerging as a vital, proven, and culturally grounded solution.",
