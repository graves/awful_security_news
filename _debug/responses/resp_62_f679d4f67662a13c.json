  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him India would stop buying Russian oil, a claim India has strongly denied. India’s foreign ministry stated it has no knowledge of such a conversation, and reiterated its policy of stable energy sourcing through diversified imports, including significant purchases from Russia. Data from Kpler shows that Indian state-owned refiners like Indian Oil Corporation Limited continue to buy large volumes of Russian oil, making abrupt cessation impractical. The U.S. has responded with additional tariffs on India, escalating diplomatic tensions. India's resistance reflects its broader foreign policy of economic independence and strategic autonomy, particularly in energy security. While diplomatic talks between India and the U.S. are ongoing, no resolution has been reached, and the issue remains a significant point of friction between the two nations.",
