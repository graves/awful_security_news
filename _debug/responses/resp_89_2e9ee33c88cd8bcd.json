    "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won the presidential runoff in Bolivia, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga with 54.5% of the vote.",
    "The victory marks the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS), which dominated Bolivian politics since 2006.",
    "Bolivia's economic crisis — including soaring inflation, dwindling natural gas exports, and fuel scarcity — was a major driver of voter discontent and contributed significantly to the shift in public support.",
    "Paz’s platform emphasized gradual reform, private sector growth, and regional fiscal autonomy, contrasting with Quiroga’s proposal of sweeping austerity and IMF-backed bailouts.",
    "Paz’s running mate, Edman Lara, a former police officer with viral TikTok content exposing corruption, helped energize younger and working-class voters.",
    "Paz’s party, the PDC, won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which won 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate, indicating a fragmented legislature that will require coalition-building.",
    "The new administration faces urgent challenges, including securing fuel supplies and maintaining social stability amid potential opposition from labor unions and public skepticism.",
    "Paz plans to phase out universal fuel subsidies, replacing them with targeted support for vulnerable groups and market-based pricing for industries like agribusiness.",
    "Both candidates pledged to improve diplomatic relations with the United States, which had been strained since 2009, and Paz has proposed a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with U.S. officials for fuel supply stability.",
    "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the election as a transformative opportunity, emphasizing renewed U.S.-Bolivia relations.",
    "Public sentiment reflects both hope for change and skepticism — some voters believe Paz is a continuation of MAS policies, not a genuine break from the past."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The election was driven by Bolivia’s severe economic crisis — including high inflation, declining gas exports, and fuel shortages — which eroded public confidence in the MAS government. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, with his party securing 49 seats in the lower house of Congress. His campaign emphasized gradual reform, private sector growth, and regional fiscal autonomy, while rejecting sweeping austerity. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal among younger and working-class voters. Both candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic relations with the United States, with Paz proposing a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal to secure fuel supplies. The new administration faces major challenges, including securing fuel, maintaining fuel subsidies for vulnerable groups, and forming governing coalitions in a fragmented legislature. Despite public skepticism about whether Paz truly represents a break from MAS, the outcome signals a significant political turning point in South American democracy.",
