  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has officially recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes, identified as the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík. The discovery, made by local resident Björn Hjaltason in October 2025 and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift in a region long thought to be mosquito-free due to extreme cold. Although a single mosquito was previously found at Keflavík Airport, this is the first natural occurrence in the wild. The species is known to tolerate cold climates and may have arrived via ships or containers. Experts remain cautious about directly attributing the discovery to climate change, noting that Iceland already experiences record-breaking heat due to warming, and that mosquito range shifts in cold regions are not yet fully understood. Ongoing monitoring in spring will determine whether the species can survive winter and establish a permanent population.",
