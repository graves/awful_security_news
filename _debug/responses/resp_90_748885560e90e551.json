Humanitarian aid continues to be delivered into Gaza, though the Rafah border crossing remains closed. Israel accuses Hamas of attacks beyond the Yellow Line in Rafah, while Hamas denies involvement and claims it is conducting internal security operations. The situation is further complicated by violence between Hamas and rival militias, including a reported public execution in Gaza City. Key US negotiators, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have arrived to push forward the next phase of the agreement, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with them ahead of a visit by US Vice President JD Vance. The ceasefire remains fragile, with ongoing disputes over hostage recovery, military violations, and political pressure from hardline Israeli figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir.",
