  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a new immediate ceasefire following over a week of deadly clashes along their disputed 1,600-mile border, which began on October 10 after Afghanistan accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes in Kabul. The violence, which resulted in dozens of civilian deaths and hundreds of injuries, intensified tensions between the two nations, each accusing the other of harboring militant groups and targeting civilians. The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, includes mutual commitments to stop attacks on security forces, civilians, and critical infrastructure. Afghanistan accused Pakistan of targeting civilians in Paktika, including a deadly attack on a cricket gathering that killed eight people, while Pakistan claimed its actions were against verified militant camps and denied targeting civilians. The conflict reflects a deeper strategic rivalry, with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) being a key security issue. The incident marks the deadliest escalation since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and signals growing instability in the region, with regional actors like Qatar and Turkey stepping in to mediate.",
