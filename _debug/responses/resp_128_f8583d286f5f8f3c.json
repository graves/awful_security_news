  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president-elect in two decades, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election, ending decades of leftist rule under Evo Morales. His victory marks a significant shift in Bolivia’s foreign policy, with a pledge to rebuild relations with the United States and reject an IMF bailout, while focusing on economic stabilization through targeted fuel subsidies and a $3.5 billion loan. Paz’s campaign, bolstered by his running mate Edman Lara—a TikTok-famous anti-corruption activist—appealed to working-class and rural voters. However, he faces pressure from Morales, who warns against neoliberalism and repression. Paz also promises judicial reform and constitutional changes, raising concerns among Indigenous populations who were politically empowered under Morales. Despite these reforms, protests erupted in La Paz and Santa Cruz, fueled by distrust in the electoral process, especially after Morales’ disputed 2019 re-election. The new administration faces the challenge of balancing economic recovery, political legitimacy, and social stability.",
