  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted on territorial concessions from Ukraine, specifically suggesting the surrender of parts of the Donbas region in exchange for Russian-held areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. This contradicted earlier claims that Ukraine might regain all lost territory. Trump, who previously advocated for Ukrainian victory, now emphasized ending the war along current battle lines due to the war’s devastation and the risk of further casualties. Zelensky expressed pessimism about Trump’s demands and described the meeting as a 'pointed conversation,' though he acknowledged it could help bring the war closer to an end. The meeting follows a prior call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a similar territorial swap. Trump later clarified he did not ask for Ukraine to give up the entire Donbas, but acknowledged significant Russian occupation. The episode reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to peace, influenced by his success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire, and highlights deep tensions in US-Ukraine relations and the broader geopolitical landscape of the war in Ukraine.",
