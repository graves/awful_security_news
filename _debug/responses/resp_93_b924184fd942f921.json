  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, focusing on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen convicted in 2023 on charges related to marijuana and cocaine use. The Trump administration defended the law, arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to public safety, particularly during encounters with law enforcement. The case is grounded in a dispute over historical precedent, with the 5th Circuit ruling that the law must be historically grounded and cannot target habitual users. Hemani and Hunter Biden, who was previously convicted under the same law, highlight both the personal and political dimensions of the issue. The Court is expected to hear arguments in 2025 and issue a decision by the end of June, potentially shaping how drug use and gun ownership are regulated in the U.S.",
