  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign candidates requiring H-1B work visas following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on the visa program. This move, which comes amid broader criticism of the H-1B system's cost and accessibility, reflects a significant shift in corporate hiring policy due to political immigration reforms. The policy change is particularly impactful because it disproportionately affects skilled professionals from India, who have historically made up the majority of H-1B applicants. The article underscores how federal immigration policy decisions—such as Trump’s proposed fee—can directly influence corporate strategy, talent acquisition, and global competitiveness in the U.S. business environment.",
