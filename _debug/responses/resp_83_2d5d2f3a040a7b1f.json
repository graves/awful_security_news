  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the fatal beating of inmate Robert Brooks, who was attacked three times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility. The incident, captured on silent body-camera footage, showed guards inflicting severe injuries—leading to a public outcry and strong prosecution claims that the guards acted as a gang with 'depraved indifference to human life.' Two other guards, Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of murder charges despite being charged with multiple offenses, including gang assault. The case is notable for the role of special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick, who took over due to recusal by Attorney General Letitia James, and who is also prosecuting guards involved in the March 2025 beating and death of inmate Messiah Nantwi at a nearby prison, indicating a broader pattern of inmate abuse within the state’s correctional system.",
