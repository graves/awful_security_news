Her hardline views on history—including denying wartime atrocities and removing references to sexual slavery from textbooks—have drawn international concern, especially from China and South Korea, where such revisionism strains diplomatic relations. Takaichi regularly visits the Yasukuni Shrine, a site controversial in Asia. Despite her position as a woman in a male-dominated political system, she has largely avoided discussions of gender equality, appointing only a small number of women to government posts and supporting traditional gender roles such as male-only succession and same-sex marriage bans. However, she acknowledges personal struggles with menopause and advocates for male education on female health. Her alliance with the Japan Innovation Party signals a move toward more right-wing policies, while her personal style—described as workaholic and unrelenting—reflects a deep commitment to political action over social balance.",
