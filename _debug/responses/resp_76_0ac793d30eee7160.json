  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to represent James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos shared with him were initially unclassified and that the government's later upclassification does not negate their original status. The dispute raises serious questions about conflicts of interest, as legal experts note that a person cannot be both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case. The controversy is rooted in the 2017 firing of James Comey, who wrote seven memoranda about his interactions with President Trump, which he shared with his attorneys—actions that are now being scrutinized under the lens of potential legal misconduct and disqualification.",
