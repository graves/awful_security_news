  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In late October 2025, New Delhi experienced one of the worst pollution spikes in its history, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times above the World Health Organization's safe limit. This spike occurred shortly after Diwali, a festival traditionally marked by widespread use of firecrackers, which release harmful pollutants. Despite a 2020 ban on traditional firecrackers and a Supreme Court permit for limited use of 'green' alternatives, enforcement was weak, allowing continued use of polluting firecrackers. Residents like Anushka Singh and Chandra Tandon described severe health impacts and a growing frustration with ineffective pollution controls. The crisis is compounded by year-round agricultural stubble burning in surrounding regions and a lack of coordinated enforcement. Other major Indian cities, including Kolkata and Mumbai, also rank among the world’s most polluted, highlighting a systemic environmental challenge across the country.",
