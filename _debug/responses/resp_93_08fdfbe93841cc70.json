  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article investigates the exploitative labor conditions in Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where tens of thousands of predominantly female workers face long hours, low wages, and rampant abuse. Despite being key to Guatemala’s economy—contributing nearly 10% of GDP—the sector operates under severe worker suppression, with union activity met with threats, firings, and violence. Korean companies dominate investment and control supply chains, while U.S. brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt source products without direct accountability. Workers report daily quotas, unsanitary conditions, sexual harassment, and the absence of severance or pensions. Union leaders like Corina Olivares face fear and intimidation, and labor inspectors are blocked from factory visits. Though President Bernardo Arévalo has introduced progressive policies and raised the minimum wage, enforcement remains weak. The article ends with a powerful personal narrative from workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, who lost their livelihoods and have chosen to exit the industry to protect their children from similar trauma.",
