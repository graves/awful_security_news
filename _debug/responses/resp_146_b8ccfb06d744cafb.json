  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The investigation found that cattle from illegally deforested zones are moved through a ‘laundering’ system using Brazil’s group-level animal transit permits (GTAs), which do not track individual animals. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify that its beef or leather products are not linked to deforestation and human rights abuses. The report highlights the worsening deforestation in Pará—up 421% in 2024—and the violence and land grabs in protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa. JBS acknowledged in a 2025 SEC filing that it cannot guarantee compliance with environmental laws, and has failed to meet past promises to trace its supply chain. While Brazil has proposed reforms requiring full traceability by 2032, advocates argue these timelines are too slow and that stronger, enforceable measures—including public access to GTA data—are urgently needed to stop illegal deforestation and protect Indigenous communities.",
