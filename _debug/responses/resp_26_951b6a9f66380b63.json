The nomination faced immediate opposition from key figures, including Sen.

The White House, under pressure from both political and ethical concerns, confirmed that the nomination was under review and effectively pulled it. Ingrassia's history of promoting conspiracy theories, anti-Israel rhetoric, and calls for martial law after the 2020 election further fueled scrutiny. Despite his lawyer claiming the texts were satirical, the public and political backlash underscored serious concerns about the integrity of the OSC appointment process and the potential compromise of whistleblower protections under a nominee with a controversial political and personal record.",
