The intervention follows escalating tensions between China and the West over semiconductor technology, including China’s tightening of rare-earth metal export controls and the US’s export restrictions on chipmaking tools. Former CEO Zhang Xuezheng has been suspended, and interim CEO Stegan Tilger has been appointed. The Dutch government has blocked major decisions at Nexperia for one year and prevented asset relocations or executive firings. China has responded by restricting exports from Nexperia China, and Wingtech has claimed the move is politically motivated. The European Union is now coordinating with the Netherlands to protect vital tech capabilities. The event underscores a growing trend of national governments intervening in private companies to safeguard critical technologies amid global geopolitical competition.",
