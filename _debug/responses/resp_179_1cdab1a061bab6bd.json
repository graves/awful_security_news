  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 disrupted global services, including vital UK institutions like Lloyds Bank and HMRC, exposing the severe risks of over-reliance on a few US tech giants—particularly Amazon and Microsoft—whose cloud services dominate the UK market. Despite the economic and operational advantages of using large-scale hyperscalers, experts warn that such dependency creates systemic fragility due to 'nested dependencies' and limited resilience. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has identified market concentration as a problem and recommended designating Amazon and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policy advocates now call for political action, including government-mandated data resilience standards, requiring companies to use multiple cloud providers and continuously replicate data, to build a more sovereign, open, and resilient cloud ecosystem.",
