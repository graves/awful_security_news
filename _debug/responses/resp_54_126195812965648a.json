  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, a woman reported missing in Philadelphia after an overnight shift at an assisted living facility, were found in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school. Authorities discovered the remains following an anonymous tip that prompted a return to the site. Keon King, a 21-year-old from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and possible homicide. DNA tests confirmed Scott’s identity. Evidence including a stolen black Hyundai Accent, seen at a recreation center the night before her disappearance, and cellphone location data linking King to Scott’s disappearance, supports the allegations. Prosecutors say more charges are pending and that others may have been involved. King had a prior arrest in a separate kidnapping case, where charges were dropped due to non-appearance of witnesses. The case highlights public concern over missing persons and violent crime in urban areas.",
