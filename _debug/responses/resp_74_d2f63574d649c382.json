  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors are challenging the legality of Patrick Fitzgerald’s role as James Comey’s defense attorney, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to distribute classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies this, asserting that the memos in question were unclassified at the time of sharing and that the government’s later upclassification does not invalidate that fact. The controversy raises significant ethical concerns about representation, especially given that the former FBI director had written seven memoranda about his interactions with President Trump, which were shared with counsel. Experts emphasize the conflict of interest inherent in someone acting as both a witness and a defense attorney. The case underscores ongoing tensions between executive branch accountability and legal representation in politically sensitive investigations.",
