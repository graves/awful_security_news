  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky became tense and acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to end the war, specifically proposing a ceasefire along current battle lines and criticizing Ukraine’s potential to reclaim all lost land. This marked a shift from Trump’s earlier claim that Ukraine could regain all its territory. During a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he reportedly received a proposal involving Ukraine surrendering eastern Donbas in exchange for Russian-held parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, a significant loss for Ukraine. While Trump denied demanding full surrender of Donbas, he emphasized that the conflict should end at current lines due to the scale of destruction and human cost. Zelensky, while expressing pessimism about Trump’s position, supported the idea of a ceasefire at existing battle lines and described the meeting as a constructive dialogue. The episode reflects a deeper ideological and strategic rift between Trump’s approach to territorial compromise and Ukraine’s desire to preserve its sovereignty, and highlights the broader geopolitical context of ending a prolonged war amid shifting international diplomacy.",
