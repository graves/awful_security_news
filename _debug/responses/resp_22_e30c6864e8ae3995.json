    "The GOP, particularly President Donald Trump and his allies, is promoting a narrative that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists, despite evidence showing the June rallies were largely peaceful.",
    "Multiple GOP officials — including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — have used inflammatory rhetoric to characterize the rallies as involving 'terrorist wing' members, 'hate America' events, or 'unhinged' individuals.",
    "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt made extreme claims suggesting the Democratic Party's main constituency consists of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals, which is widely seen as a broad and unsubstantiated generalization.",
    "Historically, Republicans have criticized similar broad characterizations of political supporters (e.g., calling Trump supporters 'basket of deplorables'), yet now they are applying the same rhetoric to the Democratic Party.",
    "The June 2025 'No Kings' rallies, which drew millions, were mostly peaceful, with only a few alleged incidents of violence — some involving counter-protesters or alleged attacks on protesters — and no clear evidence of widespread terrorism or antifa activity.",
    "Democratic leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Ruben Gallego have cautioned against giving the administration justification for militarizing the U.S. by falsely portraying the rallies as violent.",
    "Protesters in Portland have responded with lighthearted, symbolic actions (e.g., costumes) to mock the idea of a 'war' in the streets, indicating public skepticism toward the GOP’s claims of violence.",
    "Public opinion polls show that Americans are split on whether left-wing or right-wing violence is worse, and a majority (59%) view the Republican Party as more extreme than the Democrats.",
    "The GOP's rhetoric risks legitimizing the use of militarized responses to political dissent, which could expand presidential power and enable heavy-handed crackdowns on the political left."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Republican Party, led by President Donald Trump and key officials including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Tom Emmer, Sen. Roger Marshall, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has launched a highly inflammatory and baseless campaign claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies — which were peaceful in June 2025 and drew millions of attendees — are filled with antifa, terrorists, and violent extremists. Despite evidence showing minimal actual violence and no credible support for such claims, GOP officials continue to use broad, dehumanizing labels, echoing past criticisms of Trump supporters. The rhetoric is seen as strategically damaging, potentially justifying militarized responses and expanding presidential power. Public opinion polls show Americans are split on the issue of left-wing violence, and Democratic leaders warn against allowing false narratives to justify national security overreach, especially in light of symbolic and humorous protest actions in Portland, Oregon.",
