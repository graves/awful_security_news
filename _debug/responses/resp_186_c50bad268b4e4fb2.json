  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in October 2025 disrupted critical services across the UK, including banking and government systems, reigniting concerns about over-reliance on US cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. With both AWS and Azure dominating the UK cloud market—each holding 30–40% of the market—the outage revealed deep 'nested dependencies' in digital infrastructure. Experts argue that while US tech giants offer cost, scalability, and security advantages, their dominance creates systemic fragility and geopolitical vulnerability. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has flagged market concentration as a failure and recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policymakers now stress the need for political action, including mandatory data resilience standards and requirements for multi-cloud use, to build a more resilient, open, and sovereign cloud ecosystem.",
