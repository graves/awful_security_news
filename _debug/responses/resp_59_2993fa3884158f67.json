The push for a label revision originated from claims by former President Donald Trump, who suggested avoiding Tylenol during pregnancy, despite no scientific evidence supporting such a link. Multiple studies, including one analyzing over 2 million children, have found no significant associations between acetaminophen and autism or ADHD. The FDA maintains that it has not found clear evidence of harm from appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, and its official position remains unchanged. Health agencies in the European Union, UK, and Canada have affirmed its safety. Kenvue argues the proposed changes are arbitrary, unsupported by science, and contrary to established medical evidence, and claims it met with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to clarify the lack of a causal link.",
