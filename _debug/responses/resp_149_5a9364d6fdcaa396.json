  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even with current Paris Climate Agreement commitments, the planet will still face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100—nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures. This represents a significant decline from the 114 extra days projected under a pre-Paris warming trajectory of 4°C. The study highlights deep climate injustice, as small, vulnerable, and ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—accounting for less than 1% of global emissions—will experience dramatic spikes in heat, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face far fewer additional hot days. Experts warn that this growing inequality could fuel geopolitical tensions and deepen global disparities in climate resilience.",
