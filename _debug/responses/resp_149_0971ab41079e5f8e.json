The PM2.5 concentration exceeded 59 times the WHO’s recommended annual limit, classifying the air as 'hazardous.' The Central Pollution Control Board rated it as 'very poor' with an AQI of 350. Despite a Supreme Court ruling allowing limited use of 'green crackers' for three hours on Sunday and Monday, violations occurred. Air quality is expected to remain poor for days, with cross-border pollution affecting Lahore, Pakistan, where AQI reached 234. The crisis is rooted in seasonal smog caused by cold, stagnant air trapping pollutants, and reflects a recurring environmental and public health challenge in South Asia.",
