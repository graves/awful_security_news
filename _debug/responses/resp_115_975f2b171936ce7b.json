  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Meridah Nandudu, a woman from the rural Ugandan village of Bugibulungu, overcame personal trauma and gender-based economic exclusion to found Bayaaya Specialty Coffee, a business that empowers over 600 women farmers by enabling them to sell coffee beans directly and earn income. Growing up in a patriarchal society where women were excluded from coffee sales and faced domestic violence due to financial dependence, Nandudu studied social work and project management before turning to coffee entrepreneurship after a life-changing epiphany in 2020. With training from a Netherlands-funded program, she learned quality coffee production and business management. To overcome resistance from men who traditionally controlled sales, she introduced a financial incentive — an extra 200 Ugandan shillings per kilogram — for farmers who allowed their wives to sell coffee. This initiative led to significant shifts in household dynamics, enabling women to achieve financial independence, pay school fees, and escape abusive relationships. The business has expanded and now includes both women and men farmers, and Nandudu aims to eventually roast and export the coffee. Her success is not only a personal triumph but a model of gender equity in agriculture, inspiring other women in Uganda to pursue economic empowerment.",
