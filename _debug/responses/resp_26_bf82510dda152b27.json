  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on October 20, 2025, during which its Domain Name System (DNS) failed to communicate with critical databases such as DynamoDB, preventing users from accessing a wide range of online services including banking, social media, shopping, and airline booking platforms. Although the outage lasted only a few hours and was resolved by 6:35 AM ET, it highlighted the fragility of the internet’s digital backbone, as so much of the world’s online ecosystem depends on a limited number of cloud providers. Experts, including Rob Jardin and Mike Chapple, noted that the incident appears to be a technical fault rather than a cyberattack and emphasize the lack of redundancy and decentralization in modern internet infrastructure. This event echoes previous large-scale outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software failure and AT&T’s 2024 network meltdown, underscoring a growing global concern about the risks of over-concentration in cloud computing services.",
