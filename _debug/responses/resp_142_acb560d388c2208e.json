    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 restricted metals.",
    "The restrictions apply to both raw rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used in refining, with foreign companies needing special approvals to export products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "The move is framed as a national security measure, citing concerns over foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications, undermining global non-proliferation efforts.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, and sourcing 70% of its rare-earth compounds from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are vital for advanced technologies including electric vehicles, AI semiconductors, fighter jets (e.g., F-35), submarines, missiles, and medical equipment.",
    "China controls at least 60% of global rare-earth mining and 90% of processing, giving it significant strategic leverage in global supply chains.",
    "This action is seen as a strategic signal to US President Donald Trump ahead of his meeting with Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, reinforcing China’s negotiating power.",
    "The restrictions do not apply to emergency medical supplies, disaster relief, or public health emergencies, ensuring critical humanitarian uses remain exempt.",
    "Analysts interpret the move as part of 'pre-meeting choreography,' where China signals its ability to restrict supply chains to strengthen leverage during diplomatic negotiations.",
    "The US-China trade tensions have been ongoing, with reciprocal tariffs earlier this year, but both sides have agreed on a 90-day pause in tariffs to allow negotiations to resume, creating a window for such strategic actions."

The move, announced just weeks before a key US-China meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, is framed as a national security measure to counter perceived military use of Chinese rare-earth materials. China cites international practices and threats to its security as justification, while analysts see it as a strategic signal to US President Donald Trump to strengthen Beijing’s leverage during negotiations. The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, relying on them for advanced defence systems such as fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors. Despite exemptions for emergency medical and disaster relief uses, the restrictions are expected to deepen US technological vulnerabilities, disrupt supply chains, and complicate ongoing trade talks, underscoring the strategic interdependence of the two global economies.",
