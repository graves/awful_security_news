  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a man pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2021 after participating in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries via text messages. The threats, including statements like 'I will kill him for the future' and 'Even if I am hated he must be eliminated,' were reported in court documents and led to his arrest by the New York State Police, with assistance from the FBI. Moynihan, who was previously sentenced in 2023 to 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release, now faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. The arrest comes amid rising concerns about the long-term impact of blanket pardons for Capitol rioters, with Capitol Police reporting a surge in threat assessments—14,000 cases projected by year-end 2025. This case underscores a broader debate over the balance between executive clemency and public safety.",
