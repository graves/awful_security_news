  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The murder trial of Illinois Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson, charged with killing Black woman Sonya Massey in July 2024 during a routine call about a suspected prowler, has drawn national attention. Grayson, who entered Massey’s home to remove a pan of hot water, fired three times after interpreting her actions as threatening, despite her repeated assurances of peace and her documented mental health struggles. Massey’s family had previously sought mental health care, and three 911 calls were made in her name prior to the incident—information not known to Grayson. Grayson’s background, including multiple DUIs and poor performance evaluations from past jobs, has raised serious questions about law enforcement hiring practices. In response, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed a law requiring full transparency of personal and employment records for all prospective police officers. The trial was relocated to Peoria due to national attention, and jury selection included focused questions about perceptions of police force, with no jurors indicating they would accept the use of lethal force as justified. The case has become a flashpoint in national debates over police accountability, racial bias, mental health care access, and systemic reform in law enforcement.",
