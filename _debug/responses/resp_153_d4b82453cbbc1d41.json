  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year jail term at La Sante prison in Paris, becoming the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned. Convicted of criminal conspiracy for accepting millions in illegal payments from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to fund his 2007 election campaign, Sarkozy has consistently denied the charges. The presiding judge, Nathalie Gavarino, deemed the offenses of 'exceptional gravity,' resulting in a mandatory prison sentence even with an appeal. Sarkozy will be held in solitary confinement with limited contact, reflecting security concerns. His lawyers have filed an immediate appeal for release, which the court will review in two months. The case is historically significant as it marks the first imprisonment of a French leader since World War II-era collaborator Philippe Petain, sparking strong public outcry and protests. Sarkozy has expressed confidence in truth prevailing and has cited symbolic items like a biography of Jesus and 'The Count of Monte Cristo' to reflect on justice and redemption.",
