  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the collapse of Build a Rocket Boy (Barb), a video game studio founded by former Rockstar Games executive Leslie Benzies, following the disastrous launch of its first game, MindsEye, in June 2025. Despite attracting over £233 million in investment and boasting a growing workforce, the studio failed to deliver a viable product due to a lack of direction, toxic workplace culture, and abusive leadership practices. Allegations include micro-management, the issuance of thousands of so-called 'Leslie tickets' that prioritized Benzies' personal directives over team work, and a period of mandatory overtime known as 'crunch' that led to burnout and mental health issues. Early player reviews revealed severe bugs, such as characters walking on air or faces melting, causing widespread negative reception. This led to the company being forced to issue emergency hotfixes and eventually laying off 250 to 300 staff, mostly in Edinburgh. An open letter from 93 former employees criticizes leadership for ignoring feedback and failing to listen to staff, while the union plans legal action over the redundancy process. The incident has been seen as a cautionary tale about poor leadership, lack of direction, and the risks of unregulated ambition in the video game industry, especially within Scotland’s growing development ecosystem.",
