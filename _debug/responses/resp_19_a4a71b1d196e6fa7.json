  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago in response to protests against ICE enforcement, drawing on a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar actions in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that such deployments are unreviewable or entitled to great judicial deference, citing the 1827 precedent in *Martin v. Mott* that vests the president with exclusive authority to determine national emergencies. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether lower federal courts—particularly Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit—correctly blocked the deployment, with state and local officials arguing that protests do not constitute riots and that local law enforcement has handled the situation adequately. The decision is expected to have far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the executive and judiciary, as well as for future National Guard deployments in other cities.",
