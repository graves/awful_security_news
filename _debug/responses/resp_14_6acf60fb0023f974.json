  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has escalated drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, causing widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes this to a deliberate strategy of terrorizing civilians through cold and prolonged disruption. The Ukrainian government is responding with improved air defenses and retaliatory strikes, including targeting the Russian Bryansk Chemical Plant with Storm Shadow missiles. At the same time, Ukraine is urgently seeking European assistance, including air defense systems and financial support from frozen Russian assets worth $200 billion. Zelensky is also concerned about a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Russia, and is pushing for a diplomatic solution based on the current line of contact. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya notes that Russian aggression increases when Western pressure, especially from the US, weakens, particularly after shifts in US President Donald Trump’s statements. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian officials remain resolute, emphasizing that Ukraine remains the only serious party committed to peace.",
