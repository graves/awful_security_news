  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the product’s safety label that would warn about a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. The proposed changes originated from political statements by former President Donald Trump, who claimed without evidence that Tylenol use increases autism risk, prompting a citizen petition from the Informed Consent Action Network and advocacy by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, scientific evidence, including a large-scale study of over 2 million children and reviews of 46 studies, indicates no established causal relationship between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. Regulatory bodies including the FDA, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Health Canada affirm the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy. The FDA has not found clear evidence of harm, and Kenvue argues that the label changes are unsupported by science and would violate established regulatory principles.",
