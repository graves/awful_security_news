Prosecutors allege she physically assaulted agents by slapping and grabbing them, while her defense claims the incident was part of official legislative duties protected by the Speech or Debate Clause and that the prosecution is politically motivated and retaliatory, especially given President Donald Trump’s public criticism and the contrast with his pardons of Capitol rioters. Judge Jamel Semper ruled that government social media posts suggesting McIver trespassed or that Antifa was involved are prejudicial and ordered their removal. Other Democratic lawmakers were not charged, raising concerns about selective prosecution. The case is set for trial on November 10, 2025, with surveillance and body camera footage expected to play a key role.",
