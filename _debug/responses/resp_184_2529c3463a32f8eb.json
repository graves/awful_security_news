  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has received two coffins containing bodies that Hamas claims are two additional deceased Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The bodies were handed over by the Red Cross, which received them from Hamas, and are being escorted into Israel for formal identification in Tel Aviv. This would bring the total number of returned deceased Israeli hostages to 15 out of 28 under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The agreement also includes the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, and a reciprocal exchange of bodies—15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli hostage. Israel has expressed outrage over Hamas’s incomplete return of all deceased hostages, citing difficulties in locating bodies amid rubble from Israeli bombing. The transfer of bodies has sparked broader scrutiny of compliance with the ceasefire, which includes a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, a halt in fighting, and increased aid to Gaza, though violence has flared recently. Over 68,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, according to Hamas-run health ministry figures, which the UN considers reliable.",
