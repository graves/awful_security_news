    "Despite initial resistance, early allergen introduction practices are now being adopted by more pediatricians and allergists, with 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists following the 2017 guidelines.",
    "Current guidance recommends introducing peanuts and other major allergens (like milk, soy, tree nuts) between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior testing, in a safe and gradual manner (e.g., small amounts of peanut butter, yogurt).",
    "Medical experts and advocacy groups now affirm that early introduction is a proven, evidence-based strategy to reduce food allergy prevalence.",
    "The research shows that the public health impact of early allergen introduction is measurable and growing, contributing to a meaningful reduction in allergic disease."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial showed that early introduction of peanuts in infancy reduces the risk of peanut allergies by over 80%, new research confirms a significant real-world impact: peanut allergy rates in U.S. children have declined by more than 27% (and over 40% after 2017 guidelines expansion), with about 40,000 children avoiding peanut allergies since 2015. The evidence, drawn from electronic health records and supported by experts like Dr. David Hill and Gideon Lack, shows that early allergen introduction—recommended between 4 and 6 months of age—has become increasingly adopted, despite initial hesitancy. While only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists initially followed the guidelines, the trend is now showing measurable public health benefits, reinforcing the importance of evidence-based practices in reducing the prevalence of life-threatening food allergies.",
