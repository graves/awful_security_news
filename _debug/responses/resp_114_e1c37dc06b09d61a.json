  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, following a lower court's denial of the request. The administration argues that the deployment is necessary to protect federal personnel and prevent 'intolerable risks' in Chicago, especially amid protests and perceived threats to immigration facilities. This marks the first time the Supreme Court has been asked to evaluate the president’s authority to deploy military forces in a state without consent from the state governor. The case is part of a broader pattern of Trump’s attempts to deploy National Guard troops in multiple U.S. cities—including Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, and Washington, D.C.—on the grounds of rising crime or threats to ICE facilities. Such actions have faced legal challenges, with critics arguing that the president overstepped his authority and violated the principle of state sovereignty. The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond by Monday evening, signaling a significant judicial intervention in the ongoing debate over executive power and civilian control of military forces.",
