  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has confirmed that a small group of 250–350 U.S. military advisers will remain in Iraq through early 2025, primarily at Ain al-Asad and al-Harir air bases, to coordinate counter-ISIS efforts and surveillance, especially in light of security risks arising from the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. This decision is a deviation from a previously agreed September 2025 withdrawal timeline. Iraq continues to pursue a neutral foreign policy, emphasizing national sovereignty and urging the U.S. to engage in renewed diplomacy with Iran, criticizing the ‘maximum pressure’ approach as counterproductive. Simultaneously, the Iraqi government is pushing for the disarmament and political integration of armed factions like the Popular Mobilization Forces, with plans to formalize their transition into political entities ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections.",
