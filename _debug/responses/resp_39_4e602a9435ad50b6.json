The bodies, marked only with numbers, show signs of torture, including binding, blindfolding, and gunshot wounds, and some appear to have been held at the Sde Teiman detention center. Palestinian forensic experts in Gaza are working to identify them, with reports of abuse and possible post-mortem trauma. Families, such as that of Rasmiya Qdeih, are searching through the remains in hopes of identifying missing relatives. Human rights groups like the PCMFD have raised serious concerns over Israel’s lack of transparency, calling it a potential violation of human dignity and possible evidence of enforced disappearance. The absence of names and details, including the non-return of Hamas leaders Yahya and Mohammed Sinwar, has deepened global skepticism about the integrity of the transfer process.",
