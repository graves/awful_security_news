  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly funding illegal deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon through its supply chain. The report focuses on Pará, a state with the highest deforestation rates in the region since 2016, where cattle from protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa are being transported via a 'laundering' system using group-level transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual tracking. JBS has acknowledged the inability to verify the origin of its cattle, having failed to meet prior environmental commitments made in 2009. Experts and advocacy groups argue that Brazil’s current system of livestock tracking is insufficient, calling for mandatory, publicly accessible data and immediate federal action to end deforestation and protect Indigenous communities and biodiversity.",
