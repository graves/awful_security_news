  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, after overturning a prior lower court decision. The ruling, supported by two Trump-appointed judges, asserts that federal authorities have a lawful basis to protect personnel and federal assets in the face of protests, though it remains contested by Oregon officials who argue the situation is not as violent as portrayed. The decision sparks broader legal challenges in other cities, including Chicago and Memphis, where state leaders and courts are resisting federal overreach. Public backlash is growing, with nationwide protests like the 'No Kings' rally and legal actions from state officials highlighting concerns over constitutional rights, state sovereignty, and the militarization of civil unrest. The situation underscores an ongoing constitutional and political struggle over presidential power, especially regarding the use of military forces in domestic civil matters.",
