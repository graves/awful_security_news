  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi experienced one of the worst air pollution crises in the world, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times above the World Health Organization’s safe limits. This spike was primarily attributed to the widespread use of firecrackers—especially non-green varieties—despite a Supreme Court permit allowing limited use of 'green' alternatives. Poor enforcement and availability of polluting firecrackers led to significant respiratory health impacts on residents, with long-term public health concerns. The pollution crisis is further intensified by seasonal stubble burning in surrounding agricultural areas and decades of ineffective environmental policies, such as traffic restrictions and smog towers. Other Indian cities like Kolkata and Mumbai were also among the world’s most polluted, indicating a systemic national environmental issue that reflects broader challenges in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.",
