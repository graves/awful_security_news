  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough with significant implications for cancer and autoimmune disease treatments. The full award schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, with science prizes announced by Sweden’s Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, while literature and peace are awarded by the Swedish Academy and Norwegian Nobel Committee, respectively. The article highlights the prestige and global significance of the prizes, rooted in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will. It also addresses the controversial political context surrounding Donald Trump's claims of deserving the peace prize, noting that experts believe such claims are unlikely due to the committee’s emphasis on durable peace and institutional work. The article underscores the importance of academic freedom, with concerns raised about political interference from the Trump administration. Past laureates and their achievements — including Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun in medicine, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton in physics, and Han Kang in literature — provide context for the enduring impact of Nobel-winning research across science, literature, and peace efforts.",
