Demonstrations occurred in major cities and small towns, emphasizing nonviolence, free speech, and community unity. The events followed a surge in political violence and federal enforcement, including the deployment of the National Guard in Democratic cities. While largely peaceful, some incidents of physical aggression were reported. Symbolic elements like yellow and inflatable costumes underscored the peaceful and inclusive nature of the protests. The demonstrations reflect widespread public anxiety that democratic institutions are being dismantled, and that ordinary citizens must collectively act to defend democracy, justice, and human dignity.",
