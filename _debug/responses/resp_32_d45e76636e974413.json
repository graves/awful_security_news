  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' in which she alleges that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister'—widely interpreted as Prince Andrew. The memoir includes claims that Andrew had sexual encounters with her as a teenager, that his team tried to hire online trolls to discredit her during legal proceedings, and that he paid millions to settle a civil case in 2022. These allegations are further supported by newly released emails showing Andrew’s continued contact with Epstein after claiming to have severed ties. The publication intensifies a transatlantic scandal involving high-level political figures and sex trafficking, and raises serious questions about the royal family's ties to Epstein. Prince Andrew has since relinquished the title of Duke of York but retained his status as a prince, while investigations continue into his alleged misconduct and connections to Epstein.",
