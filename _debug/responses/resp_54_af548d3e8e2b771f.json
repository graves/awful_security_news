  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a statement during an Oval Office news conference, President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be priced at $150 per month, a dramatic reduction from current U.S. prices of over $1,000. Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administration’s CMS official, quickly clarified that the price reduction was not finalized and was still under negotiation. The announcement sparked significant investor reaction, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly stock prices dropping 4% in after-hours trading. While patients and doctors expressed strong hope, experts caution that the $150 price remains uncertain and may not be achievable in the near term. Current access is limited by high costs, leading many to rely on unregulated compounded versions, which carry safety risks. Experts emphasize that even if prices drop, financial barriers may persist, and more detailed policy frameworks are needed before such a change becomes real. The story reflects broader public and political interest in reducing drug costs in the U.S., especially for high-demand medications like GLP-1 drugs.",
