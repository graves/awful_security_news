  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article exposes widespread labor abuses in Guatemala’s maquila garment factories, where workers—mostly women—face exploitative conditions, including extreme quotas, wage theft, dirty water, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Despite being crucial to Guatemala’s economy and accounting for nearly 10% of GDP, these factories operate with minimal oversight, and US brands like Target and Ralph Lauren benefit without legal responsibility for worker welfare. Korean-owned companies dominate the supply chain, and union activity is met with suppression, including threats, firings, and the murder of union leaders. Workers report being laid off with no severance, and even after legal settlements, many remain financially devastated. While Guatemala’s new progressive president, Bernardo Arévalo, has pledged reforms, enforcement remains weak due to institutional failure and resistance from factory management. The article raises global concerns about labor ethics, gender inequality, and supply chain accountability in the fashion industry.",
