  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After a failed peace summit in Alaska in summer 2025 between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the US has reversed its earlier restrictions on Ukraine’s strikes against Russian energy infrastructure. Now, under new intelligence-sharing policies and an $825 million arms deal, Ukraine is authorized to target deep within Russian territory using long-range weapons such as Extended Range Attack Munitions (ERAM) and, more notably, Tomahawk cruise missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly requested these weapons to exert strategic pressure on Russia, particularly targeting energy sites. Trump has signaled openness to supplying Tomahawks, stating that such action may occur if Russia does not change its negotiating posture. While concerns exist over escalation and nuclear risks, the policy shift reflects a broader strategic effort to pressure Putin through asymmetric warfare, potentially altering the course of the war in Ukraine.",
