  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "OpenAI has introduced new policies for its AI video generation tool Sora 2 in response to widespread ethical and legal concerns from Hollywood studios, unions, and talent agencies. The tool enables users to generate hyperrealistic videos and audio from text prompts, but has been used to create unauthorized, often disrespectful, content involving real people—such as Martin Luther King Jr. changing his speech, Robin Williams talking on a park bench, or Mister Rogers greeting Tupac Shakur. These actions have been criticized as exploitative, disrespectful, and a violation of intellectual property and privacy rights. The Motion Picture Association and talent agencies, including SAG-AFTRA, United Talent Agency, and Creative Artists Agency, have issued public warnings, citing both copyright infringement and the lack of consent. In response, OpenAI has adopted an 'opt-in' policy allowing individuals to control whether their likenesses can be simulated and has agreed to remove unauthorized content, including videos of Martin Luther King Jr. California’s consent law for digital replicas has inspired the push for a federal 'NO FAKES Act', which would require explicit permission before using real people’s likenesses in AI-generated content. The controversy underscores the urgent need for legal protections, ethical standards, and consent mechanisms in the rapidly evolving field of generative AI.",
