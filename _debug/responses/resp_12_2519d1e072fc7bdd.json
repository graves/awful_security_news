  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amid a federal government shutdown starting on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that 42 million Americans could lose access to food stamp benefits in November due to a lack of federal funding. The USDA has determined that the SNAP program will run out of funds in two weeks, with no immediate contingency to cover the $8 billion in expected November benefits, despite having a $6 billion contingency fund. The Trump administration has not committed to funding SNAP and instead blamed Democrats for blocking a spending deal, while states like New York have criticized the decision as targeting vulnerable families. A $300 million tariff revenue shift preserved WIC but not SNAP. The crisis is especially alarming as Thanksgiving approaches, with food pantries already strained. Advocacy groups stress that urgent action is needed to prevent hunger among low-income households, echoing past shutdowns where temporary workarounds were used.",
