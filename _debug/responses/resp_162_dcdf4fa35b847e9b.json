  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on 2025-10-21 exposed the critical vulnerability of global digital services to failures in major US cloud providers, particularly affecting UK institutions like Lloyds Bank and HMRC. With AWS and Microsoft Azure dominating 30–40% of the UK and European cloud markets, and even smaller services relying on their underlying infrastructure, the incident highlighted 'nested dependency' and systemic risk. Experts warn that assuming these giants are 'too big to fail' is flawed, especially given past outages. While using these platforms offers benefits like cost efficiency and scalability, the concentration of cloud infrastructure raises concerns over national resilience and market fairness. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for regulatory action, including designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition. Experts and policymakers advocate for government-mandated data resilience standards, requiring multi-cloud use and continuous replication, to reduce over-reliance and build a more sovereign, open, and resilient digital ecosystem.",
