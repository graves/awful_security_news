  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator with no prior national prominence, won Bolivia's presidential runoff election with 54% of the vote, defeating right-wing candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, who received 45%. The victory marks a decisive break from the 20-year rule of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, which voters criticize for economic mismanagement and unbridled spending. Paz, backed by a coalition of working-class and rural voters, including Indigenous Aymara communities, promises to dismantle Bolivia’s fixed exchange rate and fuel subsidies while gradually implementing market reforms to avoid a deep recession. His running mate, ex-police officer Edman Lara, gained massive popularity through social media anti-corruption activism, adding a populist edge to the campaign. However, Paz faces immense economic challenges, including a severe U.S. dollar shortage, inflation at 23%, and fuel scarcity, requiring urgent action to stabilize imports and restore currency confidence. Despite pledges to avoid the IMF, his fiscal plans have been criticized as vague, and many voters remain skeptical of his ability to deliver real change. The election reflects a clear class and regional divide, with Paz gaining support in the Andean highlands and Cochabamba, while Quiroga remains strong in the wealthy agricultural region of Santa Cruz.",
