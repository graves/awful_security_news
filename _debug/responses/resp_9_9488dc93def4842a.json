  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has sued the U.S. House of Representatives over Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution mandates that duly elected members be seated, and that the Speaker lacks constitutional authority to delay swearing-in, especially when no valid reason for delay exists. Johnson claims to be following the precedent of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who delayed seating members after recess, but the Arizona legal team counters that this precedent does not justify blocking a new member’s entry. The lawsuit asserts that Johnson’s refusal is politically motivated—aimed at blocking a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations. Grijalva, who has not spoken to Johnson since her election, is attempting to meet with him to resolve the dispute. The case raises constitutional concerns about the Speaker’s power and the rights of elected officials to serve immediately in Congress.",
