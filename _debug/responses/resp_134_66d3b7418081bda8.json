  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 after being extradited from France. The case, long delayed due to prosecutorial reluctance and lost evidence, gained momentum when the victim, Shannon Keeler, publicly shared her story in 2021, which led to renewed legal action. Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you' in 2019, reactivating Keeler’s pursuit of justice. The judge considered Cleary's guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness when reducing the sentence below state guidelines. The case illustrates systemic failures in campus sexual assault cases, including the destruction of evidence and the long time it takes for victims to receive accountability, and highlights the power of survivor advocacy and media exposure in achieving justice.",
