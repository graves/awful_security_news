  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in October 2025, national parks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and New River Gorge remain open with drastically reduced staffing, leading to increased visitor numbers but significant safety risks such as illegal drone flights, base jumping, and vandalism. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of park rangers compromises emergency response, law enforcement, and visitor education. While some local businesses report stability, others like Mountain Mama in West Virginia and DC Trails in D.C. note potential economic harm. In Washington, D.C., closures of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo have redirected tourism to private attractions, boosting visits to places like Mount Vernon. However, the overall economic impact is substantial, with Destination DC estimating a $47.4 million loss in tourism revenue in a prior shutdown, underscoring the long-term effects on both local economies and public safety.",
