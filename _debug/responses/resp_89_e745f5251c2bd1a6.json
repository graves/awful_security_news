  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a government shutdown in October 2025, the Trump administration announced that it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used to support child nutrition programs — to keep the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) operational. WIC, which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable families, was at risk of shutting down due to a lack of congressional appropriations for fiscal year 2026. The White House, through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, described the move as a 'creative solution' to prevent the collapse of a critical federal program, citing the shutdown as a result of Democratic political actions. However, legal experts and advocacy groups have raised concerns about the legality of redirecting tariff funds without congressional authorization, with the National WIC Association emphasizing uncertainty around funding levels, speed of distribution, and duration. The move highlights both the political significance of WIC as a bipartisan program and the broader challenges of government funding during fiscal standoffs. Even after the shutdown ends, advocates warn of continued funding gaps, stressing the need for long-term, stable support as enrollment and inflation place increasing strain on the program.",
