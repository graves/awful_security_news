  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Madagascar experienced a political crisis following nationwide protests led by the Gen Z Madagascar youth movement, which began in September over water and power shortages. The protests escalated into demands for systemic reform, leading to the overthrow of former President Andry Rajoelina, who fled abroad and rejected responsibility for a forged resignation letter. In response, Colonel Michael Randrianirina, a long-time critic of Rajoelina, led a military coup, taking power and being sworn in as president. He appointed businessman Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as prime minister, citing his international connections and experience. The move was immediately condemned by the United Nations and the African Union, which suspended Madagascar’s membership. Domestically, the High Constitutional Court ratified the coup within hours, lending legal legitimacy to the new government.",
