  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As President Donald Trump escalates U.S. military and covert operations in Venezuela, including B-52 bomber flights and authorizing the CIA to conduct strikes on drug boats and migrants, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responds with massive mobilization of militias, military drills across 20 of 23 states, and denunciations of U.S. interference. The Trump administration claims Maduro is linked to drug traffickers, justifying lethal actions under a classified legal opinion that treats certain groups as enemy combatants. However, internal U.S. military dissent, including from SOUTHCOM Admiral Alvin Holsey and Pentagon legal experts, raises concerns about legality and compliance with international law. The detention of survivors from a recent strike introduces new legal and ethical dilemmas. In Venezuela, civilians live in anxiety, with many reporting sleeplessness and stockpiling food, while peaceful protests at universities reflect public support for U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro, in turn, has issued a state of emergency decree to consolidate power, showing a deepening of military and political confrontation between the two nations.",
