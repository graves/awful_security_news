  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This is a significant escalation from the 2018 shutdown, which was partial and lasted 35 days—the longest in nearly 50 years—costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. During that prior shutdown, around 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted from pay. The article attributes the ongoing impasse to deepening political polarization, a narrow Republican majority in the House led by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the Senate’s ability to block legislation via filibuster, preventing passage of funding bills. The article highlights that while government shutdowns have become less frequent since 1990, increasing partisan dynamics have made resolving funding disputes increasingly difficult.",
