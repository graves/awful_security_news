  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States conducted a military strike in the Caribbean on a semi-submersible vessel allegedly transporting fentanyl and other drugs, killing two men and capturing two survivors — Andrés Fernando Tufiño from Ecuador and Jeison Obando Pérez from Colombia. Despite US claims that the vessel was a 'drug-carrying submarine' operated by narco-terrorists linked to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Cartel of the Suns, Ecuador and Colombia have taken different positions: Ecuador released Tufiño due to a lack of criminal charges, while Colombia reported Obando Pérez suffered a traumatic brain injury and requires medical care. The US government asserts it is targeting drug trafficking, but experts question the legality of the strikes, which have drawn criticism from Colombia, regional nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and international legal bodies. The operation, which began in September 2025 and involved over 10,000 US troops and numerous military assets, has intensified diplomatic tensions, especially between the US and Colombia, while also fueling regional debates over sovereignty, human rights, and the legality of military interventions.",
