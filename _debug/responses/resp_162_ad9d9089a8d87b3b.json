While Belize claims it has safeguards including a national veto, caps on transfers, and security screenings to ensure safety and uphold humanitarian principles, critics—including opposition leaders like Tracy Taegar Panton—argue that the country lacks the resources and capacity to properly care for asylum seekers and could be exploited as a 'dumping ground'. The agreement raises serious human rights concerns, especially given that some countries like Eswatini and South Sudan have poor records on due process and safety. Additionally, recent cases where deportees were returned to their home countries (e.g., Jamaica, Honduras) challenge the reliability of such agreements. The deal remains under review and requires approval by Belize’s Senate, indicating that while it represents a significant policy shift, it is still subject to legal and political scrutiny.",
