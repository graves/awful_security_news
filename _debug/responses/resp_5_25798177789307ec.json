  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This follows a recent phone call between Trump and Putin, during which Trump expressed hope for a summit within two weeks. However, the administration now believes that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lacks real influence and that discussions with him do not move the process forward. A previous call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Lavrov was deemed productive but no longer essential, as both sides remain at odds—particularly over Russia’s refusal to accept a frozen conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserts that Russia’s diminished interest in diplomacy stems from Ukraine’s lack of long-range missile capabilities, suggesting that such military access is vital to achieving peace. Despite the pause in high-level meetings, the White House maintains Trump’s commitment to ending the war through diplomacy. Future diplomatic efforts may take place at a regional gathering such as an ASEAN summit, but as of now, no immediate plans exist for a Trump-Putin summit.",
