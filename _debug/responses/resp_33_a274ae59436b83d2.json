The move disproportionately impacts skilled professionals from India, who have historically made up the majority of H-1B applicants. While Walmart maintains that it is committed to hiring top talent, the change signals broader economic and strategic consequences for U.S. businesses reliant on foreign technical talent, especially in competitive sectors like e-commerce.",
