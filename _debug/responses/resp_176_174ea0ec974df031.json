  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has received two bodies from Hamas, which claims they are two additional deceased Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The bodies were delivered via the Red Cross and escorted by the Israeli military, with formal identification scheduled in Tel Aviv. This would bring the total number of returned deceased Israeli hostages to 15 under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal. The agreement also includes the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in hostilities—though violence has flared again. Hamas claims it is having difficulty locating bodies amid rubble from Israeli bombing, and previously handed over a Palestinian body due to such challenges. Israeli officials urge public sensitivity and caution against speculation, stressing that Hamas must uphold the agreement. The conflict began with a Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Since then, over 68,000 people have died in Gaza according to Hamas-run health reports.",
