  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that upheld the president’s authority to deploy the Guard during protests in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement—such as protests at an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois—justifies such action and that judicial review should be extremely deferential. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether lower courts correctly blocked the deployment, with the Department of Justice relying on the 1827 case Martin v. Mott to affirm presidential power over emergency decisions. However, Illinois officials and federal judges like April Perry argue that protests are not equivalent to riots and that local law enforcement is sufficient. The outcome of this case is expected quickly and could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the U.S.",
