  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump is being discussed, with Budapest, Hungary, proposed as a venue. Due to a blanket EU ban on Russian aircraft, Putin would need individual national consent from EU or NATO member states to fly through their airspace, particularly via Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, or Turkey. Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is actively preparing to host the summit, emphasizing its diplomatic alignment with both Putin and Trump. While the EU supports peace efforts and has not imposed a travel ban on Putin, it has frozen his assets. Hungary is also withdrawing from the International Criminal Court over war crimes allegations, which may reduce diplomatic friction. Despite logistical complexities and political sensitivities, the summit remains a key diplomatic initiative, with the European Commission and NATO members potentially accommodating the route through mutual diplomatic coordination.",
