  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with making threats against federal immigration agents through a series of TikTok videos posted between August and October 2025. Prosecutors allege that in those videos, Stanton explicitly called for the killing of ICE agents, including a statement that if they appear in a neighborhood, they should be shot. He also referenced the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, suggesting mass shootings should be carried out against federal agents. The investigation began after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, which flagged Stanton’s request for information about Israeli military locations. Federal agents attempted multiple contacts with Stanton, including a hostile exchange with a US Customs and Border Patrol officer on September 11. Stanton has pleaded not guilty and remains in detention pending trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for December 1 and a trial set for December 15, 2025.",
