  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for the Trump administration’s proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approached, nine colleges—including MIT, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth—declined to sign, citing concerns that the agreement undermines academic integrity, scientific merit, and research funding. The compact required institutions to implement policies such as banning transgender students from sports and restrooms, freezing tuition, and requiring standardized testing, all in exchange for preferential federal funding. Despite a White House virtual meeting with several universities, including UVA and Dartmouth, no agreement was reached, and opposition remained strong. Critics argue that linking federal funding to political ideologies erodes academic freedom and damages trust in higher education, especially given the administration’s prior cancellation of billions in research grants over issues like DEI programs and transgender policies.",
