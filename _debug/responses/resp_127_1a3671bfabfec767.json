  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's proposal to cut beef prices by increasing imports from Argentina is facing strong resistance from U.S. ranchers and agricultural experts. Despite the plan's aim to reduce grocery prices, experts argue that Argentine beef accounts for only about 2% of total U.S. beef imports and would not meaningfully lower prices. Ranchers are concerned that the policy introduces uncertainty, discouraging investment in cattle production. The proposal also contradicts Trump’s stated goal of supporting domestic ranching through tariffs and trade policies. While the administration, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Senator John Hoeven, supports the broader goal of helping ranchers and increasing domestic beef production, the policy remains controversial and is seen by many ranchers as politically motivated and economically unsound.",
