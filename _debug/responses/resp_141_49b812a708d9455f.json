    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, including five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and maintaining restrictions on seven previously listed ones (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium), totaling 12 of the 17 rare-earth elements.",
    "The export controls apply to both physical rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used in refining, and require foreign companies to obtain special approvals detailing the intended use of the products.",
    "China justified the controls under national security grounds, citing dual-use applications in both civilian and military technologies, and accusing certain foreign entities of transferring Chinese rare-earth materials for sensitive military purposes.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, having imported $22.8 million worth in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports sourced from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are vital for advanced defense systems (e.g., F-35 jets, submarines, Tomahawk missiles) and civilian technologies (e.g., electric vehicles, AI semiconductors, LED screens).",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global output.",
    "The new controls are seen as a strategic move to strengthen China’s negotiating leverage ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea.",
    "Analysts describe the action as 'pre-meeting choreography'—a signaling tactic to demonstrate China’s ability to restrict supply and influence trade negotiations.",
    "The restrictions could deepen vulnerabilities in the US defense and tech supply chains, potentially widening the capability gap between the US and China.",
    "Exemptions exist for exports related to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief, ensuring critical humanitarian applications are not disrupted."

The move, timed just before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, is seen as a strategic effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The controls are justified under national security grounds, citing dual-use applications and foreign entities transferring Chinese rare-earth materials for military purposes. As the US remains the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products—used in defense systems like fighter jets and submarines, and in civilian technologies such as electric vehicles and AI—this action threatens to deepen vulnerabilities in US defense and technology supply chains. Analysts interpret the move as 'pre-meeting choreography,' signaling China’s ability to weaponize its dominance in the global rare-earth supply chain.
