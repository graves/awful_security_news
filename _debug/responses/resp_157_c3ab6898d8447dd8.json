At least 75 detainees have reportedly died since October 2023, with medical experts stating deaths were due to torture or execution. Despite numerous reports, no prison personnel have been charged, and Israeli authorities have not responded to allegations. Key figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir have defended harsh prison policies, while family members of political detainees like Marwan Barghouti express fears of targeted abuse. The article underscores a global human rights concern over the normalization of torture and systemic abuse in Israeli detention facilities.",
