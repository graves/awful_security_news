  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Israel launched retaliatory strikes in southern Gaza, citing attacks by Hamas militants on Israeli troops in the Rafah area as a violation of a fragile ceasefire. The IDF claims the attacks involve gunfire and anti-tank missiles and that the strikes also target Hamas tunnel infrastructure. Hamas denies any attacks in Rafah, accusing Israel of fabricating justifications and violating the ceasefire, while also reporting that it is under pressure from internal rivalries. The U.S. State Department has raised concerns about Hamas planning attacks on civilians. A separate incident saw an Israeli attack on a bus in Gaza City kill a family of 11, including seven children, with Israeli forces claiming the vehicle was beyond the yellow line and posed an imminent threat. Gaza’s media office has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire 47 times since its implementation. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S., included the release of 20 Israeli hostages and the return of bodies of those killed in the October 7, 2023 attacks. As of the article, 16 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, and over 67,000 Palestinians have died in the war, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.",
