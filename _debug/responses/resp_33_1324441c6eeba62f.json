  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s unexpected victory in the 2025 New York Democratic primary marks the most significant electoral achievement for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a major shift in the Democratic Party’s ideological direction. The DSA has seen a dramatic membership surge—reaching 80,000 nationally—with strong grassroots organizing, especially in New York City. Despite a large voter base, few signed up with the DSA at the rally, indicating a gap between electoral support and political affiliation. The article highlights a broader movement toward democratic socialism, with increasing support among Democrats for socialist policies and declining approval for capitalism, as shown in a September Gallup poll. The DSA's activism is deeply tied to the Palestinian cause, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks, and has sparked internal debates over ideological purity, such as the de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Other progressive candidates, including Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson, are attempting to follow Mamdani’s model, signaling a broader trend of democratic socialist influence in local politics. While the DSA remains fragmented and faces challenges in governance and internal cohesion, it is seen as a response to the Democratic establishment’s perceived failure to oppose authoritarianism and protect working-class interests.",
