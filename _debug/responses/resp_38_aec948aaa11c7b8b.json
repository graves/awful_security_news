  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted that Ukraine make territorial concessions—such as surrendering parts of the Donbas region—to end the war with Russia. European officials described the exchange as tense and frank, noting that Trump raised his voice and pushed for land swaps, a significant shift from his previous claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. While Trump later stated he only advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines and denied asking for the full Donbas surrender, the meeting underscored a major pivot in U.S. policy, possibly influenced by concerns over civilian casualties and winter losses. Trump’s position aligns with his broader push to end conflicts quickly, as seen in his earlier mediation of a Gaza ceasefire. Zelensky, while critical of Trump’s demands, acknowledged the meeting as a meaningful step toward peace. The situation reflects a deepening rift between Trump’s peace framework and Ukraine’s defense and sovereignty goals, with implications for international diplomacy and regional stability.",
