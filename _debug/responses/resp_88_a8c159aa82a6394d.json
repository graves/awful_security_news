  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the 2025 New York City Democratic primary marks the most significant electoral achievement for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a broader shift in American politics toward democratic socialist ideals. The DSA, which now has a national membership of 80,000 and an active grassroots network, has seen a surge in engagement, with members across the country organizing campaigns and mobilizing voters around issues like rent control, childcare, healthcare, and Palestinian liberation. Despite internal divisions—such as the de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and debates over ideological purity—the DSA is seen as a response to widespread frustration with the Democratic Party establishment, particularly its failure to confront economic inequality and systemic injustice. A Gallup poll from September 2025 shows rising public support for socialism among Democrats (66%) and falling support for capitalism (54%). Other candidates, such as Omar Fateh in Minneapolis and Katie Wilson in Seattle, are following Mamdani’s model of grassroots, issue-driven activism. The article underscores that democratic socialism is no longer a fringe ideology but a growing, mainstream movement within the Democratic Party, especially among young voters and working-class communities.",
