The storm triggered severe flooding on Luzon, with over 47,000 people evacuating to shelters, while a major landslide in Bukidnon, Mindanao, blocked a highway and injured one person. In Pitogo, Quezon, a family of five was crushed to death by a falling tree, with a teenage boy surviving. The storm coincided with recovery efforts after a series of deadly earthquakes, prompting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to call for stronger disaster preparedness. Multiple agencies, including the Philippine disaster agency and Pagasa, coordinated response measures, including dam releases and flight cancellations, highlighting the countryâ€™s ongoing vulnerability to extreme weather events, which scientists link to climate change.",
