  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has rejected plans for a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it a 'wasted meeting' after a key disagreement over the war in Ukraine emerged. The central issue remains Russia’s refusal to accept a ceasefire at the current front line, despite Trump and European leaders supporting a freeze in combat. A preparatory meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was canceled, citing a productive prior call. Russia maintains its demand for full control over Donbas and the demilitarization of Ukraine, which Kyiv and its allies reject. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserts that discussions over long-range weapons, such as Tomahawk missiles, are what forced Russia to engage in talks, framing the front-line freeze as the first step in diplomacy.",
