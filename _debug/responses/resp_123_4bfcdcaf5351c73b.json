  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan’s parliament has elected Sanae Takaichi as the country’s first female prime minister, marking a historic shift in political leadership. Takaichi, a staunch security hawk and protege of Shinzo Abe, replaces outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost majorities in recent elections. Her government is formed in a fragile coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, lacking a majority and facing instability. Takaichi emphasizes strengthening Japan’s defense, deepening the Japan-U.S. alliance, and countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. However, her conservative policies—such as opposing same-sex marriage, male-only succession, and women’s right to choose surnames—raise concerns about gender and LGBTQ+ rights. International responses include diplomatic praise from the U.S., South Korea, and the EU, while China expresses concern over her nationalist stances, especially regarding the Yasukuni Shrine. Takaichi must navigate economic challenges, rising prices, and fragile alliances, with her upcoming talks with President Donald Trump and regional diplomacy setting the stage for critical policy outcomes.",
