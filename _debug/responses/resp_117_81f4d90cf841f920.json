  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man pardoned by President Trump after participating in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, Christopher Moynihan, has been arrested on charges of making a terroristic threat against U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Moynihan allegedly sent texts threatening to kill Jeffries, including messages such as 'I will kill him for the future' and 'Even if I am hated he must be eliminated.' Moynihan, who was previously sentenced to 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release, was granted a full pardon along with over 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants. The arrest comes amid rising concerns about political violence and the safety of lawmakers, with Capitol Police reporting over 14,000 threat assessments by the end of 2025. Critics, including Jeffries, have raised alarms about the blanket pardon policy, arguing that it enables violent individuals to reoffend and places law enforcement under increased strain.",
