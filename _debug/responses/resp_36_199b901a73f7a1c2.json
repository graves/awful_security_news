The incident sparked a public exchange on TikTok, with Sombr defending his content as lighthearted, humorous, and intended for a younger audience, stating he makes jokes only for five minutes of the concert. He also responded with a symbolic 'touch grass' gesture, a common social media trend. Meg noted the intense backlash she received, comparing it to prior political posts that generated less hostility.
