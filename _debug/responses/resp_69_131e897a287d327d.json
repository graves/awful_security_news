  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is launching a legal defense against federal charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, arguing that the prosecution is politically motivated and retaliatory, driven by President Donald Trump’s personal animus toward him. His legal team claims Trump directed the prosecution through public statements and attacks, and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan violated constitutional rules by circumventing Senate confirmation after a 120-day term limit. The defense also contends that the Justice Department’s decision not to charge other top Trump administration officials shows a pattern of selective prosecution. The case raises significant constitutional questions about executive power, retaliation, and the Appointments Clause, with a precedent drawn from the dismissal of Trump’s own classified documents case, where a similar appointment challenge was upheld.",
