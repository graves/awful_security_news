    "The decision to release the survivors instead of detaining them or prosecuting them in U.S. courts appears designed to avoid legal accountability and judicial review, especially through habeas corpus challenges.",
    "The administration's approach may have been motivated by a desire to avoid legal scrutiny, including potential challenges in U.S. civilian courts or at Guantanamo Bay.",
    "Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Todd Young, have expressed concerns about the legality of the strikes and the lack of congressional approval, and there is growing bipartisan pressure to address the issue.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration faced growing legal and political scrutiny after releasing two survivors of a failed military strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean. The decision to release them—without public evidence of their involvement in fentanyl trafficking or imminent harm to Americans—undermines the administration's narrative of a 'war' against narco-terrorists. Critics, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro and legal experts like Jack Goldsmith, question the validity of the claims, pointing out the lack of evidence, questionable operational context, and absence of due process. The move to release the individuals instead of detaining or prosecuting them appears designed to avoid legal accountability, such as habeas corpus challenges or civilian court trials. This action raises broader concerns about executive overreach, the legality of military operations without congressional approval, and the administration’s disregard for legal standards, prompting calls from bipartisan lawmakers to investigate or halt the operations.",
