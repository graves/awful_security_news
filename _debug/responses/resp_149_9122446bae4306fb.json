  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has called for urgent global action to close critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack functional systems. These gaps have led to over 2 million deaths from weather, water, and climate-related hazards over the past 50 years, with 90% of those deaths occurring in developing nations. Despite progress—such as a rise in early-warning systems from 52 to 108 countries—the assessment shows that half of 62 countries still have only basic capacity. The situation is especially dire in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Real-world examples, including the successful evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, due to glacier collapse monitoring in May 2025, highlight the life-saving potential of early warnings. The WMO emphasizes that effective early warnings must lead to early action and empower communities, not just provide alerts. The article underscores a growing global crisis as extreme weather events intensify due to climate change, affecting nations across the world—including Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, southern Europe, and the US—emphasizing the urgent need for universal access to early-warning systems.",
