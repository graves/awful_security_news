  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two voter turnout organizations founded by Stacey Abrams — the New Georgia Project and its affiliated Action Fund — have announced their closure, raising concerns about the sustainability of progressive voter organizing in Georgia. The groups, which registered tens of thousands of voters and were instrumental in helping Democrats win Senate seats in 2021, faced significant legal challenges, including a record $300,000 fine from the Georgia Ethics Commission for illegal fundraising in 2018. Despite their success in mobilizing young and nonwhite voters and contributing to Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, declining funding, leadership issues, and rising Republican turnout — especially in 2024 — have undermined their long-term viability. With Democrats now seeking to win a governor’s race and re-elect Senator Jon Ossoff in 2026, the closure signals a major shift in the political landscape and questions whether Abrams’ model of grassroots, progressive organizing can be sustained in a deeply Republican-leaning state.",
