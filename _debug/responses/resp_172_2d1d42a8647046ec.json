  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the recent escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions, with Donald Trump threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its measures are a justified response to U.S. restrictions on its industries and overreach in national security policies. The actions, occurring just before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea, are seen as strategic pre-emptive moves. Historically, both nations have engaged in a cycle of tariffs and retaliatory measures, with the U.S. previously imposing high tariffs and China responding with countermeasures. The dispute reflects a deeper shift where both countries are weaponizing economic interdependence and national security arguments. While the U.S. maintains broader economic resilience and leverage, China appears more strategically prepared, using gradual export restrictions to project resolve. Experts warn that the conflict could reignite a trade war, affecting global supply chains, technology development, and market stability, with neither side willing to back down.",
