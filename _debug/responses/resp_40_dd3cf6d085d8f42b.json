  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work has begun to restore power at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare local ceasefire zones between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The plant has been without off-site power for four weeks—the longest blackout since the war began—compelling it to operate on emergency diesel generators for over 20 days. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that repair efforts are underway after coordination between both sides, with Rafael Grossi emphasizing the importance of restoring off-site power for nuclear safety. Ukraine blames Russia for intentionally cutting power to test reconnection with the Russian grid, while Russia attributes the outage to Ukrainian shelling. Both sides have accused each other, and the situation highlights the ongoing threat of radiation incidents due to military aggression. The ZNPP has lost grid connection ten times since the war began, and recent attacks, such as one on a substation in Slavutych, demonstrate the broader targeting of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The restoration effort is critical for both safety and geopolitical stability, and while progress is being made, the risks remain high due to active hostilities and occupation of the plant.",
