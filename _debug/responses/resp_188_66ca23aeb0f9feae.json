  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Operation Dudula, an anti-migrant movement in South Africa that began in 2022, has escalated its campaign by blocking foreigners from accessing public health clinics in provinces like Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. The group, led by Zandile Dabula, enforces strict ID-only entry, turning away migrants and even some South Africans without proper documentation, arguing that healthcare resources must be prioritized for citizens. Despite constitutional guarantees of universal healthcare, critics—including human rights groups and political parties—claim the movement violates human rights and law and order. While some local residents support the action as reducing long queues, the campaign has left vulnerable individuals like Tendai Musvava and Sicelokuhle Moyo without essential medications, forcing them to seek costly private alternatives. Authorities have condemned the actions, but legal setbacks and limited police resources have allowed Operation Dudula to continue, with plans to expand into public schools.",
