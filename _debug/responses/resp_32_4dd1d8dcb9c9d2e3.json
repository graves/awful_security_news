  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate, a major highway, resulting in a premature detonation of a 155mm shell. The explosion sent fragments that struck and damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. Despite prior safety assumptions that high-flying shells would not endanger ground-level traffic, the incident raised serious safety concerns. The demonstration, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the plan 'dangerous' and ordered the highway closure. The Marine Corps has not clarified who authorized the firing or whether safety protocols were compromised. The incident coincides with a surge in US artillery production—more than tripling since 2022—driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia. A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed past manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive composition, later reversed for production efficiency. Experts, including retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian, emphasize that while such demonstrations are standard during VIP visits, a premature detonation is abnormal and raises questions about shell quality and safety protocols.",
