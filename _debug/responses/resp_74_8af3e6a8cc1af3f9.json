  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance responded to widespread 'No Kings' protests with AI-generated social media memes mocking demonstrators, reinforcing a narrative of presidential monarchical authority. This behavior, along with Trump's pardon of convicted fraudster George Santos and military actions in the Caribbean and Venezuela, signals a growing disregard for constitutional checks and democratic norms. Protests involving over 2.7 million Americans across 50 states demonstrate significant public resistance to perceived authoritarian overreach. The article argues that Trump’s actions—such as dismissing dissent, bypassing due process, and expanding executive power—validate the protesters’ claim that the U.S. is moving toward autocratic rule. Despite White House dismissals of the protests, many Americans, including ordinary citizens like Peggy Cole, see the demonstrations as a necessary defense of democracy and rule of law, suggesting a potential shift in public sentiment toward greater civic engagement.",
