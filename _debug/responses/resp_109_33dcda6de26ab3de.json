  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to commit to the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several prominent institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, the University of Virginia, and Dartmouth College—have publicly rejected the proposal. The compact demands policies such as banning transgender people from using restrooms or playing sports aligned with their gender identity, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international enrollment, and requiring standardized admissions tests. Institutions like MIT and UVA argue that such policies conflict with academic merit and integrity, especially regarding research funding. Despite a White House meeting with multiple universities to discuss the compact, the resistance has grown, with two schools reaffirming their refusal. The administration’s broader history of canceling federal research grants over issues like diversity and inclusion has intensified concerns about political interference in academic freedom.",
