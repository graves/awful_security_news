  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the ongoing debate over whether Ukraine can receive U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles to conduct long-range attacks deep into Russian territory. While the Tomahawk has a proven combat history and advanced capabilities, the U.S. currently has limited supply due to domestic needs, and Ukraine lacks the necessary launch systems like the Typhon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for Tomahawks to target key Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, arguing they would strengthen Ukraine’s position in negotiations. However, the Kremlin warns such a move could escalate the war and be seen as a hostile act due to the missile’s potential nuclear capability. Ukraine’s own Flamingo missile remains unproven and underdeveloped, and despite the strategic value of Tomahawks, Ukraine’s immediate military needs center on enhanced air defenses against Russian missile and drone attacks.",
