  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The world’s first proposed global carbon tax on shipping, aimed at curbing the industry’s significant contribution to climate pollution, collapsed after a failed vote at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) summit in October 2025. The US, under President Donald Trump, led a fierce campaign against the tax, branding it a 'scam tax' and threatening sanctions on countries supporting it, including visa restrictions and blocking of vessels from US ports. While nations like the European Union, Brazil, and Vanuatu backed the tax to meet the IMO’s 2050 net-zero emissions goal, oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and the US opposed it due to economic concerns. After four days of intense negotiations, Singapore proposed a one-year delay, which was accepted, effectively halting the tax’s adoption. Experts warn this failure undermines decades of climate diplomacy, increases costs for clean shipping innovation, and signals a broader decline in global climate ambition, raising serious concerns about the future of climate negotiations at COP30 in Belém, Brazil.",
