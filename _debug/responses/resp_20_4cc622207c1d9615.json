He is relying on a recent 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that supported similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles, arguing that such actions are within the president's exclusive discretion under the precedent of Martin v.

However, Illinois officials and Judge April Perry, who temporarily blocked the deployment, argue that protests should not be equated with riots and that state law enforcement has adequately managed the situation. The Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of the deployment and may issue a decision within days, which could significantly influence future National Guard deployments in other U.S. cities during the Trump administration.",
