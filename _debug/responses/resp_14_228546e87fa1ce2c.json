  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is projected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, marking it as the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm poses a severe threat to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where torrential rains—potentially exceeding one foot—could trigger dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While the storm’s exact path remains uncertain, the most likely track leads it toward Hispaniola, where it could reach Category 1 hurricane strength by Saturday. A secondary scenario suggests it may move westward toward Central America, with lower rainfall and flood risk. Although a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, rough surf and rip currents are possible along the East Coast, with Florida being a potential, though less likely, area of impact. The storm’s rapid intensification is tied to warming ocean temperatures, a trend linked to fossil fuel pollution, and mirrors recent patterns observed in hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. As the storm develops, its path and severity will be closely monitored by the National Hurricane Center, with Atlantic hurricane season officially ending on November 30, even though tropical systems can still form beyond that date.",
