  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence in La Santé Prison in Paris for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has served time in prison. While Sarkozy has appealed the conviction and maintains his innocence, he is currently held in the prison's VIP wing, traditionally reserved for high-risk political or criminal figures such as Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. The case raises broader concerns about foreign influence in political campaigns and judicial accountability. His legal team has requested early release, with a decision expected within two months.",
