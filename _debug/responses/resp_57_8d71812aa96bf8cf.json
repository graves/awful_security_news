  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is challenging proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products, arguing that claims linking its use during pregnancy to autism or ADHD are unsupported by scientific evidence. Despite statements from former President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggesting a connection between Tylenol and neurodevelopmental disorders, major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, and regulatory bodies in the U.S., EU, UK, and Canada have affirmed that acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe. A citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network called for a warning label, but Kenvue and the FDA have maintained that no causal relationship has been established, and that current labeling remains scientifically accurate. The FDA’s official position, unchanged since August 2025, emphasizes that appropriate use of acetaminophen does not lead to adverse outcomes in pregnancy or child development.",
