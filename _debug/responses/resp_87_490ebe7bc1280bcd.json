  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, specifically targeting habitual marijuana users. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistan dual citizen, who was indicted in 2023 after marijuana and cocaine were found at his home. A lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court precedent that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots and be tied to past laws. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that precedent, ruling that such laws cannot target habitual drug users. The Trump administration appealed, arguing that such users pose a danger to law enforcement and society, especially while impaired. The DOJ also alleged connections between Hemani and Iran, including fraud with Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps affiliates and participation in a celebration of Qasem Soleimani’s life. Hemani’s legal team challenged the historical basis of the law, noting widespread state-level legalization of marijuana. Notably, Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the Hemani case next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026, reigniting debate on the balance between Second Amendment rights and public safety in drug-related gun restrictions.",
