Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the operation as part of a broader campaign against 'the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,' framing drug cartels as terrorist threats. This marks a significant shift from traditional Coast Guard interdiction, now involving lethal military strikes without due process, justified by a classified legal opinion designating traffickers as enemy combatants. The actions have drawn international backlash, especially from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US of killing an innocent national and canceled US aid. Congressional opposition, led by Senators Rand Paul and Tim Kaine, highlighted concerns over executive overreach, with the Senate blocking a resolution to limit presidential war powers. The broader strategy includes military actions in Venezuela to pressure President Nicolás Maduro, indicating a convergence of drug trafficking enforcement and geopolitical intervention.",
