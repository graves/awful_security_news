  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for data centers, the strain on terrestrial infrastructure—especially in terms of land use and carbon emissions—has prompted exploratory efforts to move data processing into space. Initiatives like the European ASCEND project and companies such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are testing the feasibility of space-based computing. These ventures leverage the uninterrupted solar access and potential for energy independence in space, with some launching small-scale prototypes or constellations. While proponents argue space-based centers offer a sustainable and sovereign future, especially as land and energy constraints grow, critics warn of high costs, radiation risks, space debris, and technical challenges. Despite skepticism, the sector is advancing rapidly, with major launches expected by 2026 and 2027, signaling a potential shift toward space as a viable alternative to Earth-based data centers in the coming decade.",
