    "The number of patients needed to treat one person for pain relief is around seven — comparable to current pain medications, suggesting it's effective but not a universal solution.",
    "THC and CBD appear to be key compounds in pain relief, especially for chronic back pain, with THC being a primary contributor to analgesic and sleep benefits.",
    "Despite promising results, experts note the findings may be specific to the tested compound and not generalizable to all chronic pain conditions.",
    "In the U.S., only one cannabis-derived medication (Epidiolex) is FDA-approved, and it lacks THC; thus, limited access and lack of standardized product quality remain significant barriers.",

    "The FDA's requirement for U.S. replication of trials reflects regulatory caution, despite support for science-based research."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two major clinical trials in Europe have shown that a full-spectrum cannabis oil (VER-01) developed by Vertanical significantly reduces low back pain and improves sleep, outperforming both placebo and opioids in pain relief over six months. Patients on cannabis experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects and no signs of dependency or withdrawal. The study indicates a 30% average pain reduction in the cannabis group compared to a 20% reduction in placebo, with a treatment effect that requires only about seven patients to treat one person. Experts like Kevin Boehnke and Simon Haroutounian see the results as promising but note limitations, including specificity to the tested compound and lack of broad applicability to all chronic pain. While cannabis appears safer than opioids in terms of addiction and overdose, individual patient responses vary, with some experiencing adverse effects. Despite strong evidence from Europe, FDA approval in the U.S. is delayed due to regulatory requirements for replication, and only one cannabis product (Epidiolex) is currently approved, with no THC. The findings have sparked interest among clinicians and patients seeking safer, more effective alternatives to opioids for chronic pain, especially given the growing prevalence of low back pain as a global disability driver.",
