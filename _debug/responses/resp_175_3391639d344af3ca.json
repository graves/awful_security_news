  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Orange juice prices in the UK have risen sharply from 76p to £1.79 per litre since 2020, driven by a combination of global supply shocks including citrus greening disease, extreme weather, droughts, trade tensions, and regulatory pressures. Key producers like Brazil and Florida have faced severe crop failures, pushing prices to record highs. In response, companies are substituting oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins, mangoes, and pomegranates. Tariff conflicts between the US and Canada, and US tariffs on Brazilian juice, have further inflated prices. Packaging regulations, such as Extended Producer Responsibility, add to production costs. Despite a drop in inflation in 2023, prices are rising again, indicating persistent structural issues in global food supply chains. This trend is not isolated to orange juice—beef, butter, coffee, and milk prices have also increased. Experts suggest that retailers may have delayed passing on cost increases, and that the UK’s heavy reliance on imported fruit makes it vulnerable to global disruptions. While some recovery is expected as Brazil's harvest improves, the long-term trend suggests that food price volatility may become a regular feature of consumer life, especially under the pressures of climate change and shifting consumer preferences.",
