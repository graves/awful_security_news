  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge — including traditional signals like gunfire and observations of animal behavior or weather patterns — is being used effectively by local shepherds to detect and warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), despite the government’s significant investment in technological early warning systems. Communities report deep distrust in these systems due to frequent malfunctions, poor maintenance, and lack of community involvement in their design and operation. As climate change accelerates glacier melt and reduces snow cover, GLOFs are becoming more frequent, with nearly 90 such events occurring between 2019 and 2022. The government’s $37 million GLOF-II project, launched in 2017, has failed to establish real-time links between local human sensors and official rescue teams, leading to widespread reliance on local heroes like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain. These individuals, who have saved lives through time-tested, community-based knowledge, were recently rewarded by the Prime Minister. The story underscores a broader global challenge: that early warning systems are only effective when rooted in local knowledge, trust, and inclusive governance, rather than relying solely on technology.",
