This marks part of a broader crackdown that has led to over 50 detentions since 2025, including the death of a WFP worker in Saada earlier in the year. The UN has responded by suspending operations in Saada and relocating its top humanitarian coordinator to Aden. The Houthis have repeatedly accused UN staff of espionage, which the UN has denied. This incident underscores the growing threat to humanitarian operations in Yemen and the escalating conflict between the Houthi rebels and international actors.",
