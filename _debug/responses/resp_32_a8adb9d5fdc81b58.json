  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a live-fire artillery demonstration involving an M777 Howitzer fired shells over the I-5 interstate, a major highway. One shell prematurely detonated at a high altitude, sending fragments that struck a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The event, which had not occurred since the 1950s, raised significant safety concerns, especially after Governor Gavin Newsom closed the highway citing risks. The U.S. has significantly increased 155mm shell production since 2022—more than tripling output—to supply Ukraine, but this surge has coincided with past manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and changes in explosive composition (from TNT to a more stable compound, later reverted). Experts, including retired Marine Corps colonel Mark Cancian, questioned why the shell exploded, noting it should not have happened given the high trajectory. The affected batch of shells has been frozen and will not be reused. While such demonstrations are common during VIP visits, the premature detonation is seen as abnormal and potentially linked to manufacturing or procedural flaws.",
