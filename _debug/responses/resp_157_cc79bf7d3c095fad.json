  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "South Korea has arrested a North Korean soldier who crossed the heavily fortified military demarcation line (MDL) into South Korea, a rare and significant event in a region still technically at war. The soldier, reportedly approached by a South Korean soldier and expressing a desire to defect, may have been familiar with the terrain, possibly due to prior exposure. This incident is especially alarming to Pyongyang, as the defector could provide intelligence on troop movements and military operations. The event reflects broader geopolitical tensions, including the collapse of U.S.-North Korea denuclearization talks in 2019 and a shift in South Korean policy under President Lee Jae-myung, who advocates for dialogue and peace. Most defectors now go through China, making direct crossings extremely rare and dangerous. This incident underscores the persistent risks and human stories behind inter-Korean border dynamics.",
