  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major jewellery heist occurred at the Louvre museum in Paris on Sunday morning, where four masked thieves used a mechanical lift and power tools to break into the Galerie d'Apollon in just seven minutes, stealing eight high-value items including a Napoleon-era necklace and a diadem from Empress Eugénie. The theft, which took place during museum opening hours and was carried out with apparent ease, has triggered national outrage and criticism of weak security measures, including a lack of surveillance in key areas and a recently broken alarm. French officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, have acknowledged serious vulnerabilities, while experts like Chris Marinello warn that the stolen jewellery will likely be broken up and sold for money laundering if not recovered within the next 24 to 48 hours. President Emmanuel Macron described the incident as an 'attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history,' and political figures such as Nathalie Goulet have condemned it as evidence of organized crime with no regard for historical or cultural value. The museum has closed for the day, and investigations are ongoing.",
