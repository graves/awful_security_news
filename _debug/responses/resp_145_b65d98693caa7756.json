    "The decision to postpone the framework was made after a vote in London, with 57 votes in favor of delay and 49 against, reversing earlier approval in April.",
    "The framework, if adopted, would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon penalty for emissions and rewards for emission reductions, aiming for a 20% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.",
    "The delay undermines global climate action, as shipping is a significant source of emissions and climate change impacts are already affecting maritime safety and operations.",
    "Countries like China, EU, Britain, and Brazil supported the plan, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it; Argentina and Singapore initially supported but voted to delay.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to reduce shipping emissions by introducing a carbon pricing mechanism, by at least 12 months due to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump criticized the initiative as a 'Global Green New Scam Tax,' threatening sanctions on countries supporting it, which led to a shift in the IMO’s voting pattern. While the NZF was previously approved in April 2025, a new vote in London in October 2025 resulted in a 57–49 decision to postpone the framework, with key nations like China, the EU, and Britain maintaining support, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or abstained. The delay undermines global climate efforts, as shipping is a major contributor to emissions and climate-related disruptions. The proposed carbon pricing mechanism would charge $380 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent emissions, with incentives for cleaner alternatives. Industry leaders and climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s climate minister and the International Chamber of Shipping, have expressed disappointment and concern over the lack of clarity and stability needed for investment in decarbonization technologies.",
