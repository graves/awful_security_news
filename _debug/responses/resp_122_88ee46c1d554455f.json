  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case questioning whether people who regularly use marijuana can legally possess guns. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man charged with a felony gun possession charge after being found with a firearm in his home, despite being a regular marijuana user. The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is appealing a lower court ruling that declared a blanket ban on gun ownership for drug users unconstitutional under the Supreme Court’s 2022 expanded Second Amendment interpretation. Hemani’s attorneys argue the law risks criminalizing millions of Americans, given that at least 20% of U.S. adults have used marijuana. The government counters that regular drug use, especially when paired with guns, poses a public safety risk, citing FBI evidence from Hemani’s home. The case marks a significant flashpoint in the ongoing legal and political debate over firearm rights and drug policy, with arguments expected in early 2026 and a decision likely by early summer. This case also brings attention to the broader political tensions, including the personal connection to Hunter Biden, who was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned by his father, President Joe Biden.",
