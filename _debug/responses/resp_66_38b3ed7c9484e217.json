  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite President Donald Trump’s high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal, public support remains weak, with Americans showing little enthusiasm and disapproving of his handling of both foreign policy and the economy. Polls reveal that Trump’s approval ratings on economic issues have reached a historic low, driven by rising inflation, stagnant wages, and growing job insecurity. Even though the Gaza deal was seen as a significant international achievement, domestic sentiment is shaped more by economic concerns than by foreign policy outcomes. The article suggests that Americans prioritize economic stability over international diplomacy, and that past failures in peace agreements — like the Biden administration’s brief ceasefire — have fueled skepticism about the current deal’s durability. As a result, the Gaza agreement appears to have minimal impact on Trump’s domestic political standing.",
