  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalation of US-China trade tensions, centered on President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its measures are a justified defense against US trade restrictions and national security actions targeting Chinese firms, particularly in key sectors like maritime logistics and shipbuilding. The actions reflect a broader pattern of both nations weaponizing economic interdependence and expanding the definition of national security to include economic and technological activities. Historically, the US has imposed a range of tariffs on Chinese goods, from 25% in 2018 to a 100% threat in 2025, while China has responded with retaliatory tariffs and export controls. Experts note that China has adopted a more strategic, organized approach, while the US has shown inconsistent policy direction. With a key meeting between Trump and Xi scheduled in South Korea, the article underscores the high stakes of the dispute, including risks of a full trade war, global supply chain disruption, and long-term economic impacts on both nations and their global partners.",
