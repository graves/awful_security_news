  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-powered voice scams has emerged in Italy, where fraudsters used artificial intelligence to clone the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and deceive wealthy businessmen into transferring over a million euros. The scam, which occurred shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, exploited the growing realism of AI voice technology. Research by Queen Mary University of London demonstrated that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often perceiving them as more trustworthy. The global financial impact of such scams has risen sharply, exceeding $547 million between January and June 2025. This rise in deepfake fraud has prompted legal action, including a US federal law criminalizing the distribution of AI-generated intimate images and a similar move by Australia to ban specific deepfake generation apps. While AI voice technology offers benefits like restoring speech for individuals with disabilities, its misuse in identity theft, fake news, and illegal content creation raises significant societal and ethical concerns.",
