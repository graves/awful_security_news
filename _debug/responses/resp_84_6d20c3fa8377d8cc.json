  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major outage on October 20, 2025, lasting several hours and disrupting services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking. The outage stemmed from a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented access to data stored in DynamoDB and other services like EC2. Although the root cause remains unclear, experts attribute the widespread impact to the internet's overreliance on a small number of cloud providers, highlighting a critical lack of redundancy and competition. Past outages—such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software flaw and AT&T’s network failures—demonstrate a recurring pattern of systemic fragility, suggesting that the internet’s decentralized design has been compromised by centralization. Experts warn that without greater diversification and fail-safes, future outages will continue to have global consequences.",
