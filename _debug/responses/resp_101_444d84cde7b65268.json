  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a 34-year-old man pardoned by President Trump in 2021 after participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has been arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The threat was allegedly communicated via text, and Moynihan was arraigned in Clinton, New York, with a bail amount ranging from $10,000 to $80,000. Moynihan previously served 21 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.

Critics, including Jeffries, argue that the blanket pardon of over 1,500 Capitol riot defendants—including individuals with prior convictions for crimes like domestic violence and sexual abuse—has allowed violent individuals to re-enter society and commit new offenses.",
