  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a significant outage starting at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern Time on October 20, 2025, affecting its US-EAST-1 region and causing widespread disruption to numerous online services including Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, the McDonald’s app, Coinbase, and Signal. The issue was reported through AWS’s Health Dashboard and confirmed by user reports on DownDetector. By 6 a.m. Eastern Time, AWS confirmed recovery across most services and stated it was working toward a full resolution. Experts such as Patrick Burgess of BCS emphasize that the modern internet is fundamentally dependent on a few major cloud providers, making such outages impactful and widely felt, even if users only notice failures in apps like Snapchat or Roblox. The incident is attributed to a technical issue, not a cyberattack, and is resolved through established cloud infrastructure protocols. This event illustrates the fragility and interconnectedness of global digital services underpinned by centralized cloud computing platforms.",
