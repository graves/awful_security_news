  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on Trump’s threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China’s retaliatory export controls on rare earth minerals. This renewed tension follows a history of tit-for-tat tariffs, with the US previously imposing up to 145% tariffs and China responding with reciprocal measures. China justifies its controls as a defense of national security, particularly in response to US restrictions on Chinese tech firms and industries. Experts note that both countries are weaponizing economic interdependence, with China adopting a broader national security framework earlier than the US. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is now in doubt due to the intensity of the dispute, with analysts suggesting that neither side is willing to back down. The conflict highlights deepening global uncertainty, with rare earths and semiconductors at the core of the strategic competition. Ultimately, the article suggests that while both nations have significant tools of economic and technological leverage, the long-term outcome will depend on how global markets and economic conditions respond to the ongoing escalation.",
