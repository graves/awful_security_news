  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is actively opposing a proposed FDA labeling change that would warn pregnant individuals about a potential link between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD in children. The push for a label change originated from claims by former President Donald Trump, who asserted without scientific evidence that Tylenol use during pregnancy increases autism risk. Despite this, major studies and health organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists and international regulatory bodies such as the European Union, United Kingdom, and Health Canada, state that there is no clear causal link between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. The FDA has not found sufficient evidence to support such a link and maintains that acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately. Kenvue argues that the proposed labeling changes are arbitrary and not supported by scientific data, and has urged the FDA to deny a citizen’s petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network, which is closely tied to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The controversy highlights the tension between political messaging and scientific evidence in public health policy.",
