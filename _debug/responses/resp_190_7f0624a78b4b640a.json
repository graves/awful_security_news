The foundation, which holds significant voting power despite owning only 28.1% of shares, pushed for a more extensive reconfiguration of the board, rejecting a proposal to bring in new members with new skills. This leadership transition follows earlier changes, including the removal of former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen and the announcement of 9,000 job cuts. Despite being Europe's most-valued company in 2024 due to high demand for its weight-loss drugs, Novo Nordisk has faced declining share prices and reduced profit forecasts due to increasing competition from rivals like Eli Lilly. The proposed appointment of Lars Rebien Sorensen, former CEO of Novo Nordisk and current head of the foundation, to replace Lund reflects the foundation’s strong influence on corporate governance and leadership decisions.",
