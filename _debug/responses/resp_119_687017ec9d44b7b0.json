    "The Trump administration proposed a 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' to incentivize colleges to adopt politically aligned policies, including banning transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports in alignment with their gender identity, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized tests for admissions.",
    "Six out of the original nine universities indicated they would not sign the compact, with MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth explicitly rejecting it.",
    "The rejection of the compact reflects broader tensions between federal policy and academic autonomy, particularly regarding issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and scientific merit in higher education funding.",
    "The White House held a virtual meeting with several institutions to discuss the compact, but no binding agreement emerged, and two schools—UVA and Dartmouth—subsequently reaffirmed their refusal.",
    "University leaders argue that the compact undermines academic integrity, scientific research funding, and equitable access to education, especially when tied to political priorities rather than merit-based evaluation.",
    "The administration has previously canceled billions in federal research grants over disagreements on transgender policies, DEI programs, and antisemitism on campus, increasing pressure on institutions to comply with political directives."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' approaches, multiple institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the proposal. The compact demands policies such as barring transgender students from restrooms or sports, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international student enrollment, and requiring standardized admissions tests. Institutions argue that such policies conflict with academic integrity, scientific merit, and inclusive educational values. Despite a White House meeting with several schools, including UVA and Dartmouth, no agreement has been reached, and growing dissent signals a significant challenge to federal political influence in higher education. The administration's prior cancellations of federal research grants over DEI and transgender-related policies have further intensified resistance, raising concerns about the future of academic freedom and merit-based funding in the U.S. higher education system.",
