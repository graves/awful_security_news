  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In early October 2025, the Big Cities Health Coalition — a coalition of public health leaders from major U.S. cities — issued a strong public call for vaccination, criticizing federal officials, including President Donald Trump and CDC vaccine advisers, for spreading false claims and altering immunization schedules in ways that limit access and erode public trust. The coalition highlights the rising measles outbreaks, such as one in upstate South Carolina involving over 100 quarantined students, as evidence of the dangers of vaccine hesitancy. Local officials argue that political interference has undermined science-based public health decisions, with declining trust in the CDC noted in a KFF poll. Major medical organizations like the AAP and ACOG have also distanced themselves from CDC guidance. The article emphasizes that public health is now a shared responsibility across jurisdictions, with local systems relying on collaboration due to the mobility of populations and the interconnected nature of disease spread. Despite federal efforts to restore scientific integrity, the crisis underscores the urgent need for transparent, evidence-based, and trusted messaging to protect communities during the approaching respiratory virus season.",
