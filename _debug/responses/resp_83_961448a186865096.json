  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have survived its first major test after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed at least 44 people. Both sides accuse each other of ceasefire violations: Israel claims Hamas attacked beyond the Yellow Line in Rafah, while Hamas accuses Israel of failing to return all deceased hostages and violating truce terms. Despite the tensions, both Hamas and the Al-Qassam Brigades reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement. Humanitarian aid continues into Gaza, signaling a partial adherence to the ceasefire's humanitarian goals, though the Rafah border crossing remains closed. US diplomats Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are present to advance the next phase, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with them ahead of a visit by Vice President JD Vance. Internal conflicts in Gaza, including an alleged public execution and clashes between Hamas and Israel-backed militias, further complicate the situation. Political pressure in Israel, especially from far-right figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, underscores the fragile nature of the agreement.",
