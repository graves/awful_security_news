  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "City health officials, united through the Big Cities Health Coalition, are urging widespread vaccination amid growing concerns that federal officials—including President Donald Trump and CDC advisers—are spreading false claims and altering vaccine schedules. The coalition, composed of public health leaders from major cities across both Democratic and Republican states, emphasizes that vaccination protects children, schools, and families from outbreaks of diseases like measles and flu. A measles outbreak in South Carolina involving over 100 unvaccinated students illustrates the urgent need for public health action. Declining public trust in the CDC, with only half of Americans now trusting it, is attributed to perceived political influence in vaccine policy. In response, city health leaders argue that public health decisions must be science-driven, not ideologically driven, and highlight the importance of cross-jurisdictional collaboration to address health threats that cross state lines.",
