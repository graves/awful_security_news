  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would use tariff revenue—specifically from Section 232 tariffs—to fund the WIC program during the government shutdown, preventing a collapse of a vital food assistance program for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. This decision follows a funding lapse due to Congress’s failure to pass a spending bill for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1, 2025. The White House, through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, claimed the move was necessary due to congressional inaction and political obstruction, while critics including budget experts and the National WIC Association raised concerns about legality, transparency, and long-term sustainability. Despite bipartisan support for WIC, political leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson have blamed Democrats for the shutdown, highlighting the program’s vulnerability as a symbol of broader governmental dysfunction. While the administration asserts that tariff funds can be redirected through legislative designation, legal experts argue that without congressional appropriation, such reallocation lacks authority. With WIC enrollment rising due to inflation and improved access, advocates stress the need for sustained and adequate funding beyond the short-term fix.",
