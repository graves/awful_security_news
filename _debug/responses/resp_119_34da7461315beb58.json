  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has publicly objected to President Trump's use of his performance of 'Danger Zone' in an AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, where a crown-wearing Trump is shown in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protest crowds in Times Square. The video, posted in response to widespread 'No Kings' protests, uses music from the 1986 film Top Gun, which was created by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock, with Loggins as the performer. Loggins asserts that the use of his music is unauthorized and morally inappropriate, arguing that such content serves to divide Americans rather than unite them. While copyright law generally permits such use if royalties are paid, artists often choose to object publicly to uphold artistic integrity. The White House did not directly respond to the objection, instead sharing a Top Gun film still with the caption 'I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED,' suggesting limited engagement. This incident echoes previous legal challenges by musicians like The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, who have sued Trump over political misuse of music, highlighting a broader concern about the ethical boundaries of using copyrighted content in political messaging.",
