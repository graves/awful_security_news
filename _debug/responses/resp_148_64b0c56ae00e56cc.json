  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed expectations of an imminent Trump-Putin summit, with the White House stating there are no plans for a meeting in the immediate future and the Kremlin emphasizing that serious preparation is required. Initially announced as a meeting in Hungary within two weeks of a October 16 phone call, the summit is now delayed due to a fundamental disagreement over ceasefire conditions: Russia demands control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and the dismantling of Ukrainian military capabilities, while Trump and Ukraine advocate for a freeze of battle lines. A preparatory meeting between U.S. Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was also canceled, indicating reduced diplomatic momentum. The U.S. and Ukrainian leadership criticize Russia for stalling peace efforts and continuing military actions, asserting that only Ukraine’s leadership can drive meaningful progress. The delay undermines Trump’s credibility and highlights a deepening rift in peace proposals.",
