  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live-fire artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate highway — a rare event not seen in over 70 years. A 155mm shell from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated during the exercise, sending fragments that struck and damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause, and the affected shell batch will be frozen. The incident raised safety concerns, especially after California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the decision to fire over a major highway. This event occurred amid a broader surge in U.S. 155mm shell production (tripled since 2022) driven by Ukraine’s war with Russia, and coincided with a VIP visit involving Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. A 2024 Reuters investigation had previously highlighted manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and a shift from TNT to a less stable explosive, which the Army reversed due to production demands. Experts like retired Marine Colonel Mark Cancian emphasized that while the shells were fired high and theoretically safe, the premature detonation was abnormal and concerning.",
