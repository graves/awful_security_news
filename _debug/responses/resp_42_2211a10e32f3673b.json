This marks the first full shutdown in a period of political deadlock, with the last major shutdown occurring in 2018—lasting 35 days and becoming the longest in nearly 50 years. The 2018 shutdown cost the U.S. an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected around 800,000 federal employees, with 300,000 furloughed and 300,000 exempted from pay. The current situation reflects deep political divisions, including a narrow House majority and lack of Senate votes to end a filibuster, making bipartisan compromise difficult. This ongoing shutdown raises concerns about economic impact, public service disruptions, and long-term political instability.",
