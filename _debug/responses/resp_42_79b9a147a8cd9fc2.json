  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza appears to have withstood its first major test after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 44 people in response to claims that Hamas attacked Israeli forces, killing two soldiers—Major Yaniv Kula and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz. Both Israel and Hamas reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, though both accused the other of violations. Hamas claimed to have found another Israeli hostage and warned that further escalation would hinder recovery efforts, while Israel accused Hamas of attacking beyond the Yellow Line and delaying the return of all deceased hostages. Aid deliveries were resumed despite a prior halt, signaling Israel’s intent to uphold core ceasefire components, though the Rafah Crossing remains closed. Internal Hamas security operations, including an alleged public execution in Gaza City, have heightened tensions, and political figures like Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized the resumption of aid as a 'shameful backdown.' The next phase of the ceasefire depends on continued diplomatic engagement led by US officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as well as the resolution of security and humanitarian issues.",
