  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, President Donald Trump suggested that popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be priced at $150 per month, citing a contrast between drug prices in the US and Europe. Though Dr. Mehmet Oz, the White House physician and CMS Administrator, clarified that the price reduction has not been finalized, the announcement sparked widespread excitement among patients who have struggled with high costs. Patients such as Janet McCaskill and Kay Powell, who currently rely on compounded or discounted versions costing $150 to $500 per month, expressed hope for improved access. The proposal led to a significant drop in stock prices for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, reflecting investor uncertainty. Experts caution that while a $150 price would greatly improve affordability and access, especially for uninsured or underinsured patients, it remains a speculative promise, not a confirmed policy. The initiative falls under the broader Most Favored Nation drug pricing framework, which aims to align US prices with those in other countries. Despite the potential benefits, concerns remain about safety and efficacy of compounded drugs, and experts note that even $150 may not be fully accessible due to out-of-pocket costs, regulatory hurdles, and lack of formal commitments from drugmakers. Overall, the article highlights the urgent need for affordable access to GLP-1 medications and the political and economic forces shaping drug pricing in the U.S.",
