  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on a threatened 100% tariff by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese goods in response to China’s export controls on rare earth minerals. China justifies its actions as a national security measure in retaliation for U.S. restrictions on Chinese firms in key sectors. This conflict builds on a history of tit-for-tat tariffs, including Trump's previous 25% and 20% tariffs and Biden's targeted restrictions on semiconductors and tech exports. Both countries are using economic tools as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, with experts noting that China has shown greater strategic preparation and the U.S. faces challenges in maintaining coherence. The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea is under pressure, as both sides accuse each other of double standards and trade bullying. The broader implications include a deepening of great power competition, with technology and rare earths at the core of national security strategies. Experts suggest that neither side is willing to back down, and the outcome will depend on global market reactions and how both economies manage the costs of continued escalation.",
