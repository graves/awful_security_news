  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New US tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture have added significant cost pressures to the housing market, exacerbating existing challenges such as high mortgage rates and weak demand. Homeowners like Anthony Cabrera and industry professionals like Jean Lin and Michael Trubrig report rising material and labor costs, with companies like RH and IKEA warning of price increases. Experts including Peter Harrell, Buddy Hughes, and Matthew Walsh emphasize that while the tariffs may not collapse the homebuilding industry, they are compounding a fragile market by increasing input costs and reducing affordability—especially for low-margin affordable housing. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs predict that consumers will bear up to 55% of the tariff burden, with costs expected to rise further in the coming months and potentially ramp up again in January. Overall, the tariffs represent a growing burden in an already strained housing sector, affecting both individual buyers and large-scale construction operations.",
