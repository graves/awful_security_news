  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan, which would have introduced a global carbon-pricing system charging ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions. The decision, made during a London meeting, follows Trump's public condemnation of the initiative as a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' and his call for countries to vote against it. While 63 countries previously supported the framework, key supporters such as China, the EU, and Britain were pressured, and countries like Argentina and Singapore changed their stance. The delay undermines global efforts to reduce shipping emissions, with the IMO aiming for a 20% cut by 2030 and full elimination by 2050. Climate scientists and maritime industry leaders warn that this setback threatens progress against climate change, with rising storms and altered ocean currents already impacting shipping safety. Despite opposition from fossil fuel-aligned nations, the framework remains a critical step toward sustainable maritime transport.",
