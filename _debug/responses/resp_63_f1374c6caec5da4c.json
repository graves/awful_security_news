  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is challenging proposed changes to the acetaminophen safety label that would warn pregnant women about a potential link between Tylenol use and autism or ADHD in children. The FDA is under pressure from a citizen’s petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network, which is aligned with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to add stronger warnings to over-the-counter products. However, Kenvue and medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, assert that there is no scientific evidence of a causal relationship between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. A large-scale 2024 study of over 2 million children found no significant links, and a 2025 meta-analysis concluded only an association, not causation. The controversy was ignited by President Donald Trump’s public claim that Tylenol use during pregnancy increases autism risk, a claim lacking scientific support. Regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada have affirmed that acetaminophen remains safe during pregnancy, and the FDA has not updated its official position despite the political push. Kenvue argues that proposed label changes would be arbitrary and contrary to science, and the company has met with Kennedy to clarify the lack of evidence behind the claims.",
