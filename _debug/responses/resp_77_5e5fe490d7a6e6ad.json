  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which critical internet services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking became inoperable for several hours. The root cause appears to be a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS) that prevented access to data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services, despite the data remaining safe. Experts attribute the outage to a technical fault, not a cyberattack, and highlight a broader systemic issue: the internet’s overreliance on a few centralized cloud providers, which reduces resilience and increases vulnerability when one component fails. Previous outages, including one in 2021 and a global CrowdStrike software failure in 2024, reinforce concerns about infrastructure fragility. Experts warn that without greater redundancy and competition in cloud services, internet disruptions will continue to be frequent and impactful.",
