  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, contradicting his earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. The meeting, described as tense and frank by European officials, culminated in Trump pushing for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the devastation and risks of prolonged conflict. Trump denied asking for a full surrender of Donbas, stating only that 78% of Ukraine’s land is already occupied and that a halt at current lines is necessary. Ukrainian officials downplayed the meeting as aggressive, calling it a constructive dialogue with clear next steps. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously proposed a territorial swap involving Donbas and southern regions, which remains a point of contention. This episode marks a significant shift in Trump’s approach to ending the war, influenced by his recent success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza and growing concerns over escalating violence in Ukraine.",
