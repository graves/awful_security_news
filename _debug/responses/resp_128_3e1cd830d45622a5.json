  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the economic and human consequences of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, focusing on the termination of the humanitarian parole program and the increased H-1B visa fees. These policies have led to job losses for immigrant workers like Maria in Florida, disrupted essential labor in healthcare, farming, and manufacturing, and caused significant economic setbacks. Businesses such as Goodwin Living are struggling to replace foreign workers, and international partners like South Korea are expressing concern over U.S. policy. Economists warn that the loss of immigrant labor could result in near-zero or negative job growth, reduced innovation, and economic stagnation. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office has downgraded economic growth forecasts due to these policies, and foreign workers are increasingly choosing to leave the country. Overall, the article highlights how immigration enforcement is not only a political issue but a critical factor in maintaining economic productivity, labor availability, and global competitiveness.",
