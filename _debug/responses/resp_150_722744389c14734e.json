  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), under the UN, has issued a global call to action to address critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events. Despite progress in climate monitoring—such as the expansion of multi-hazard systems from 52 to 108 countries—nearly half of all countries still lack sufficient capacity, with 16% having less than basic systems. The WMO highlights that 90% of weather-related deaths in the past 50 years have occurred in developing countries, and that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early warnings. Real-world examples, such as the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten in May 2025 due to a predicted glacier collapse, underscore the life-saving potential of early warnings. The article emphasizes that extreme weather events—floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US—have intensified due to climate change, with permafrost melt exacerbating risks. The WMO stresses that early warning systems enable early action, and its ultimate goal is not just to warn but to empower communities globally to respond effectively.",
