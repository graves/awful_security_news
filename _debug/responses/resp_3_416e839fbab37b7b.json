    "Tropical Storm Melissa is forming in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to become a hurricane by Saturday.",
    "Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean Sea.",
    "The storm is currently about 300 miles south of Haiti with sustained winds of 50 mph.",
    "A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.",
    "There is a low but non-zero chance Melissa could directly impact the mainland United States, with the most likely impacts being rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast.",
    "If Melissa follows the most likely track, it could strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning and bring over a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, leading to flash flooding and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.",
    "Melissa has the potential to bring significant rainfall to Jamaica and Puerto Rico as well.",
    "Alternative tracks could lead the storm to move westward toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras) or Cuba, with reduced rainfall and flood risk.",
    "The Caribbean Sea’s extremely warm waters, due to climate change, are fueling rapid intensification of storms like Melissa.",
    "This year, three of four Atlantic hurricanes (Erin, Gabrielle, Humberto) have undergone extreme rapid intensification, highlighting a trend linked to fossil fuel pollution and global warming.",
    "Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form afterward."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday. It is currently about 300 miles south of Haiti with sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, especially the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where it could deliver over a foot of rain, leading to dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may experience rain, though direct U.S. landfall is unlikely. Melissa’s rapid intensification is tied to the warm Caribbean waters, which have been exacerbated by climate change, following a pattern seen in hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. While the most likely path takes Melissa toward Hispaniola, a westward track toward Central America is also possible. The article emphasizes that the Atlantic hurricane season is not ending quietly and that late-season storms remain a risk, as shown by past events like Hurricane Nicole and Zeta.",
