  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and Dartmouth, have rejected a White House funding proposal that offers preferential access to federal grants in exchange for adopting ideological policies such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment at 15%, freezing tuition for five years, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes. The compact also requires annual anonymous staff and student polls to monitor compliance. Universities argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, merit-based research funding, and institutional autonomy. While the White House sees the compact as a way to foster a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas' and strengthen national education, critics emphasize that it undermines the core principles of free inquiry and independent governance in higher education. The White House has set a deadline of November 21, 2025, for initial signatories, with ongoing discussions among remaining institutions.",
