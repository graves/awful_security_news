  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition — to keep the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) operational during a government shutdown caused by Congress’s failure to pass a fiscal year 2026 spending bill. WIC, which serves nearly 7 million vulnerable women and children, faced a critical funding shortfall, with the National WIC Association warning of severe uncertainty around funding levels, speed of distribution, and duration of support. While the White House claims the move is a 'creative solution,' legal experts and budget analysts question its legality, arguing that Congress must first appropriate funds before federal agencies can spend them. The move reflects broader political tensions, with Republican leaders blaming Democrats for the shutdown and emphasizing the impact on vulnerable populations. Bipartisan support for WIC persists, and advocates stress the need for long-term, stable funding to prevent benefit cuts amid rising inflation and growing enrollment. The proposed use of tariff revenue ties trade policy to social welfare, illustrating a strategic policy approach that links economic instruments to domestic aid.",
