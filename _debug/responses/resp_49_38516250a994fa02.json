  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the remains of a deceased Israeli soldier, Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, as part of the ongoing process under the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire agreement. Haimi, a 41-year-old military officer, is the 13th deceased hostage to be identified since the ceasefire was signed on October 9, 2025. His body was retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza, transferred to Israeli forces, and identified by Israeli forensics. The identification comes amid concerns that Hamas may not be able to recover all deceased bodies due to extensive war damage, and one prior transfer involved a body that was not Israeli, suggesting possible misidentification. Israeli officials, including the Prime Minister’s office and Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, stress that the return of all deceased hostages must be fulfilled. The US, through President Donald Trump and envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, continues to pressure Hamas to comply, with Trump threatening to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the agreement. The article underscores the humanitarian, diplomatic, and military tensions surrounding the recovery of hostages and the enforcement of the ceasefire."
