  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests erupted in Gabes, Tunisia, as residents demand the shutdown of the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which they blame for decades of environmental and health crises, including respiratory illness, cancer, and the collapse of marine life. The protests, led by the powerful UGTT labour union and fueled by public anger over years of pollution and broken government promises, have brought the city to a standstill. Despite a 2017 pledge to phase out the plant, authorities have instead increased production, calling phosphate a pillar of the economy. Over 200 people have been hospitalized due to toxic exposure, and environmental activists claim the plant has poisoned the air, sea, and food supply. The unrest marks a significant political test for President Kais Saied, who has previously centralized power and faced mounting public dissent. In response, Chinese firms have been deployed to manage emissions, but the crisis underscores deep public distrust in environmental governance and calls for systemic change.",
