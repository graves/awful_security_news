  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing changes in weather, animal behavior, and using traditional signals like gunfire—is being used by shepherds to predict and warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially in the absence of reliable and trusted early warning systems. Despite government investments in technological systems like the $37 million GLOF-II project, communities report frequent failures, lack of maintenance, and poor communication, leading to a deep erosion of trust. In contrast, stories from individuals like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain show how traditional human-based responses have successfully saved lives. This highlights a critical issue: technology alone cannot ensure safety without community engagement, cultural relevance, and operational integrity. As climate change intensifies, with rising temperatures and glacial melt, the resilience of local knowledge systems is proving vital to protecting lives and livelihoods in Pakistan’s most vulnerable areas.",
