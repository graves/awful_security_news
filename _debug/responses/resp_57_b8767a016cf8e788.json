  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah man named Nicholas Rossi, who used the alias Arthur Knight and faked his death in 2020 to evade arrest, was sentenced to a prison term ranging from five years to life after being convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. The case emerged from a decade-old DNA rape kit backlog, where his identity was traced through tattoos and an Interpol notice. After being arrested in Scotland in 2021 and extradited to Utah in 2024, Rossi maintained his innocence and claimed he was being framed. Jurors found him guilty based on testimony from the victims, who described coercive financial demands and violent rape. The judge described Rossi as a 'serial abuser' and a 'flight risk,' emphasizing public safety concerns. The case underscores the dangers of flight and deception in sexual crimes and highlights the importance of DNA databases and cross-jurisdictional law enforcement cooperation.",
