  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces and expands upon the concept of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms into exploitative, profit-driven systems — using case studies of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber. He outlines three stages of decline: initial user-friendly growth, favoring business customers at user expense, and finally, profit maximization through data manipulation, predatory pricing, and reduced service quality. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and insufficient consumer protection regulations. He proposes policy solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, a 'right-to-exit' policy, and greater interoperability between platforms. Amazon and Facebook have responded by denying claims of product cloning and junk fees, but Doctorow cites research to support his assertions. The article raises broader concerns about the future of internet platforms and the need for regulatory reform to preserve user and business interests.",
