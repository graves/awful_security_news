  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. conducted its seventh military strike in the Caribbean against a vessel suspected of drug trafficking, linked to a Colombian terrorist organization. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the three individuals on board were killed, with no U.S. casualties, and called drug cartels 'the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere'. This action is part of a broader Trump administration strategy targeting drug traffickers and using lethal force, including CIA operations in Venezuela and threats against President Nicolás Maduro. The move has sparked diplomatic tensions with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing a civilian, prompting Trump to cancel all U.S. payments to Colombia. Critics, including Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, have raised alarms over the lack of due process, calling the policy of summary executions a violation of legal norms. A classified legal opinion justifies the designation of traffickers as enemy combatants, enabling lethal action without trial—marking a significant shift from traditional law enforcement methods like Coast Guard interdiction.",
