    "A Slovak court convicted 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula of a 'terror attack' and sentenced him to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "The shooting occurred during a government meeting and was motivated by Cintula's claim of 'moral despair' and political frustration with Fico’s government policies.",
    "Prosecutors reclassified the act as a 'terror attack' due to its political motivation, not premeditated murder, reflecting the broader concern over political violence.",
    "Cintula stated he intended to protest government decisions, such as halting military aid to Ukraine, and described Fico as 'drunk with power' and a symbol of corruption and irrationality.",
    "The prime minister, Robert Fico, has accused the liberal opposition and media of inciting the attack, though no evidence has been presented.",
    "Since 2023, Fico’s government has implemented increasingly authoritarian policies, including media crackdowns, restrictions on nonprofits, and a constitutional amendment limiting same-sex couples' rights.",
