The items were crafted by renowned 19th-century jewelers and represent deep historical and cultural ties to French monarchy. Among the stolen pieces, one of Eugénie’s crowns was recovered near the scene, though damaged. Experts, including art recovery specialist Arthur Brand, describe the theft as a 'national disaster' due to the irreplaceable value of these artifacts, which symbolize France’s imperial past and national pride. The jewelry has passed through generations and institutions, including the Orléans family and Van Cleef & Arpels, before being acquired by the Louvre in the 20th century. The loss is seen as a serious blow to cultural heritage, with suspects believed to have dismantled and sold the items to maximize financial gain.",
