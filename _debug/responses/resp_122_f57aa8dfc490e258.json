  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown—specifically the termination of humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans, along with increased enforcement and visa fees—has severely disrupted the U.S. labor market. Workers like Maria, a cleaning employee in Florida, and Haitian workers at Goodwin Living, are losing their jobs, while skilled workers such as H-1B visa holders are fleeing due to policy signals. The economic impact is profound: hiring has slowed to just 29,000 jobs per month from June to August 2025, down from 400,000 monthly during the post-pandemic boom. Experts warn that without foreign labor, U.S. job growth could turn negative, inflation may rise, and economic growth forecasts have been downgraded. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July 2025, funds extensive immigration enforcement, including 10,000 new ICE agents and expanded detention centers, further escalating labor shortages in agriculture, construction, and technology sectors. The article underscores that immigrants are not only essential laborers but also contributors to innovation and economic resilience, making the current policy shift both economically damaging and socially disruptive.",
