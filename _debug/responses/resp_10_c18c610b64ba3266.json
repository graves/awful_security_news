  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' in which she alleges that she was raped by a powerful man described as a 'well-known Prime Minister' — widely believed to be Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom. The memoir, released in October 2025, contains harrowing details of her abuse and her attempts to seek justice, including claims that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was 17 and that he paid millions to settle a civil case. The article highlights the contradiction between Prince Andrew’s public denial of ties to Epstein and evidence, such as emails from February 2011, showing he continued to communicate with Epstein. Furthermore, it alleges that Andrew’s team attempted to hire online trolls to harass Giuffre during her legal case. These revelations have intensified scrutiny on Prince Andrew and the British royal family, prompting him to relinquish the title Duke of York while retaining the title Prince, and reigniting a transatlantic scandal about the connections between power, wealth, and sexual abuse.",
