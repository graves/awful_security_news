  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is allegedly linked to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon through its supply chain, particularly in Pará, where illegal cattle ranching in protected areas has been documented. Human Rights Watch found that JBS does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested zones to be 'laundered' via transit systems, obscuring their origins. This is enabled by Brazil’s inadequate livestock tracking system—based on group-level transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual records. The report highlights violations in protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, with the state agency Adepará authorizing cattle transport without environmental oversight. Despite JBS’s past commitments under the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement and new policy timelines (2026 for Pará, 2032 for the federal level), experts and advocacy groups argue that voluntary corporate action is insufficient and that stronger federal regulation, including public access to GTAs, is urgently needed to stop deforestation and protect Indigenous communities.",
