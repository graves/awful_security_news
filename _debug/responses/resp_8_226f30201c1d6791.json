  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a Pentagon memo requiring nearly all military officials, including commanders and senior civilian leaders, to obtain prior approval from the Office of Legislative Affairs before engaging with Congress or state lawmakers. The policy, signed on October 15, 2025, applies to top military officials but excludes the Pentagon Inspector General. The Pentagon claims the measure improves messaging consistency and prevents contradictions in budget and policy proposals, while critics argue it reflects a broader pattern of restricting communication with Congress, undermines transparency, and is logistically impractical given the volume of routine engagements. Assistant Secretary Dane Hughes has been tasked with reviewing current practices and recommending improvements. The policy follows a history of similar restrictions by Hegseth, including limiting interactions with think tanks, and has drawn strong criticism from lawmakers and reporters who see it as an effort to reduce accountability and democratic oversight.",
