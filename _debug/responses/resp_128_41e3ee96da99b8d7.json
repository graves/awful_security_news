    "The population growth is attributed to improved conservation measures, including new management rules in Canada and reduced ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements.",
    "Despite progress, the species remains vulnerable due to threats such as ship collisions and entanglement, and reproduction rates remain low, especially among injured or underfed females.",
    "In 2024, four mother whales had calves for the first time, and some established mothers showed shorter intervals between births, indicating a potential shift in reproductive health.",
    "Only 11 calves were born in the most recent year, which is below researchers' hopes, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is seen as a positive sign.",
    "Environmental groups warn that ongoing threats to the Marine Mammal Protection Act and weakening of NOAA’s science-based safeguards could jeopardize continued recovery.",
