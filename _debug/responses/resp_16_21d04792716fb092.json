    "A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica.",
    "Melissa could bring over a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, increasing the risk of catastrophic landslides and flooding.",
    "There are two primary track scenarios: one toward Jamaica and western Haiti, potentially becoming a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday; the other moving west toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras), possibly affecting Cuba.",
    "Although a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, there is a low chance of impact on Florida, the Bahamas, or Cuba due to its potential path.",
    "Recent trends show more rapid intensification of Atlantic hurricanes due to global warming, as seen with storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto in 2025.",
    "Hurricane season officially ends on November 30, but tropical systems can still form after that date."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa is actively moving through the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by the end of the week, posing severe flooding and mudslide threats to Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic due to heavy rainfall. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the storm could affect Florida, the Bahamas, or Cuba depending on its path. Forecasters are tracking two main scenarios: one where Melissa turns northwest toward Haiti and Jamaica, potentially becoming a Category 1 hurricane, and another where it moves west toward Central America. The storm's intensification is linked to broader climate trends, such as global warming, which has led to increased rapid intensification of hurricanes in recent years. The Atlantic hurricane season continues through November 30, with tropical systems still possible beyond that date.",
