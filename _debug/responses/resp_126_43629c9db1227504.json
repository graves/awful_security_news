Europe, with 71 international players, leads the continent in representation, prompting discussions between the NBA and FIBA about launching a new European league as early as 2027.

The Atlanta Hawks tie an NBA record with 10 international players on their opening roster, and all 30 teams now have at least one international player. Meanwhile, the league tracks milestones such as LeBron James’ career records, the 14 millionth point being scored around November 17, and the Brooklyn Nets’ lack of top-tier scorers, highlighting contrasts in team development. The article underscores how basketball is becoming increasingly global, driven by talent, tradition, and evolving league strategies.",
