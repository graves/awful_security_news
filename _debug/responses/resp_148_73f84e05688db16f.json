  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s climate-vulnerable regions—particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are increasing due to climate change. Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, communities lack trust in these systems due to frequent failures, poor maintenance, and lack of community involvement. Instead, local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain rely on Indigenous knowledge—such as observing weather patterns, animal behavior, and using traditional signals like gunfire—to predict and warn villagers of floods. In one case, timely human intervention saved hundreds of lives, demonstrating the effectiveness and cultural relevance of traditional knowledge. The article highlights a broader issue: even with technological infrastructure, climate resilience depends on community trust, local knowledge, and inclusive implementation. As global warming accelerates, Pakistan’s reliance on Indigenous human knowledge may remain a critical, underappreciated component of disaster preparedness.",
