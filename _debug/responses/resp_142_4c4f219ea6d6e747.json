  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual weather patterns, animal behavior, or using traditional signals like gunfire or fire—to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite government investments in early warning systems (EWS), including the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems have frequently failed due to technical malfunctions, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. Residents report that official warnings are not trusted, with real-life cases like that of shepherd Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain showing how traditional human-based early warning systems successfully saved lives. Pakistan, despite low emissions, is one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, with rising temperatures accelerating glacier melt and increasing GLOF risks. The article underscores that effective climate resilience requires not only technology but also community trust, intergenerational knowledge, and inclusive governance, suggesting that Indigenous practices remain a vital, underappreciated component of disaster preparedness.",
