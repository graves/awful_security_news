  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the exploitative labor conditions in Guatemala’s garment factories (maquilas), where tens of thousands of mostly female workers face long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats of dismissal. Despite their crucial role in Guatemala’s economy—accounting for nearly 10% of GDP—workers lack formal contracts with US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Most factories are owned by Korean companies, which dominate the sector and operate with limited oversight. Workers report wage theft, impossible production quotas, and dangerous conditions, including dirty water and physical abuse. Union activity is suppressed, with threats, violence, and even murder of union leaders. The article highlights how US brands benefit from sub-contracting models that shield them from accountability. A major case involving Rutilia Cano, who lost her pension when her factory closed, illustrates the financial devastation faced by long-term workers. Despite promises from President Bernardo Arévalo to improve labor standards, enforcement remains weak due to resistance from factory owners and institutional failure. The article concludes with a warning about the gendered and systemic nature of global garment supply chains, calling for urgent reform and transparency.",
