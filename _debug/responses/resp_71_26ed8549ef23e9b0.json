  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the public reaction to President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire deal, noting that while the agreement was seen as a diplomatic win, it has not significantly boosted Trump’s approval ratings. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC shows that Americans remain largely disapproving of both Trump’s handling of the Gaza issue and his economic policies, with the economy—especially inflation and cost of living—being a more pressing concern than foreign affairs. Despite initial spikes in approval, public sentiment remains lukewarm, and recent events, such as rising regional tensions and the fragility of the deal, suggest it may not last. The article concludes that Americans are prioritizing economic stability over foreign policy outcomes, reinforcing the idea that Trump’s political standing is more affected by domestic economic performance than by international achievements.",
