    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its extreme cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquito species, Culiseta annulata, in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík.",
    "The discovery was made by Björn Hjaltason, who first observed the insect at dusk on October 16, 2025, and later confirmed it with entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson.",
    "The mosquitoes identified are of the species Culiseta annulata, native to the Eastern Hemisphere and known for withstanding cold winters by sheltering in protected areas.",
    "This is the first recorded instance of mosquitoes thriving in the natural environment in Iceland; a single mosquito of a different species was previously found on an airplane at Keflavík Airport, but that was not in the wild.",
    "Scientists are uncertain about how the species arrived, with theories involving ships or containers, and ongoing monitoring in spring 2025 is needed to assess whether the species can survive the winter and establish itself.",
    "Climate change is a potential contributing factor due to rising temperatures, which may expand mosquito habitats and allow for more species to establish in colder regions like Iceland.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson caution that while warming may increase the likelihood of mosquito presence, it is not certain that climate change directly caused this discovery, and the broader ecological implications remain uncertain."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long known for its extreme cold and mosquito-free status, has officially confirmed the presence of wild mosquitoes in its natural environment. The first such discovery occurred in Kiðafell, Kjós, western Iceland, when Björn Hjaltason observed and collected a mosquito at dusk on October 16, 2025. The insect was identified as Culiseta annulata, a cold-adapted species from the Eastern Hemisphere. Scientists believe the species may have arrived via ships or cargo containers, though its long-term survival in Iceland remains uncertain. While climate change may have contributed to warmer conditions enabling mosquito survival, experts remain cautious, noting that such shifts are complex and not yet clearly established. This discovery marks a pivotal moment in Iceland’s ecological history and raises broader questions about how global warming is altering species distributions.",
