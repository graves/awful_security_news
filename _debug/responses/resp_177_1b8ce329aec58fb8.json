  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israel Defense Forces have identified the bodies of two Israeli hostages — Arie Zalmanowicz, an 85-year-old man from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Master Sgt (res) Tamir Adar, a 38-year-old community security member — returned by Hamas under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal. Zalmanowicz was killed in captivity after being abducted on 7 October 2023, while Adar was killed during the initial attack. Their remains were transferred through the International Committee of the Red Cross and delivered to Israeli forces, who transported them to Tel Aviv for formal identification. The return of these 15 deceased hostages marks progress in the agreement, which requires Hamas to return all deceased Israeli captives. However, Israel has criticized Hamas for delays, citing difficulties in locating bodies due to destruction in Gaza. The agreement has also led to the release of over 2,000 Palestinian detainees and a temporary halt in fighting, though violence has flared again. Over 68,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the initial attack, according to Hamas health ministry figures.",
