  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is actively scrutinizing federal enforcement actions during the Operation Midway Blitz protests in Chicago, particularly focusing on the use of force, lack of warning to demonstrators, and failure to comply with her body-worn camera mandate. While CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE Special Response Teams lack them and have not received them despite being trained in crowd control and protest responses. A pastor, Rev. David Black, testified that he was struck with pepper balls during a protest in Albany Park without warning, prompting further investigation. Federal leadership is described as unstable, with key officials like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino having recently departed, raising concerns about accountability. The Trump administration has denied media reports of tear gas use without warning, and legal experts are questioning the transparency and consistency of federal operations during the protests.",
