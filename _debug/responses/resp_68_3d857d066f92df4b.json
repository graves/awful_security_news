  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in 2025, national parks across the U.S., including Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite, remain open with limited staffing due to furloughed National Park Service employees. While some tourists, like Nudrat Mahajabin, visit despite closures, advocates and local businesses express growing concern over safety risks, such as unauthorized drone use, base jumping, and trash buildup. In West Virginia, state leadership and local businesses like Rob Dobson’s rafting company report resilience, while others like Eddie Love’s cabins see significant drops in bookings. In Washington, DC, closures of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo have driven a surge in visits to private attractions like Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of rangers and staff compromises emergency response and visitor safety, with environmental issues like litter accumulating. The economic impact on local tourism economies is significant, especially during peak months, and raises questions about the long-term sustainability of national park operations during federal shutdowns.",
