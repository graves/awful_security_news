  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a formal legal defense against federal charges of lying and obstructing Congress, claiming the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His attorneys argue that Trump's public attacks on Comey, combined with the unconstitutional appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan after the 120-day limit expired, constitute a violation of constitutional protections and the rule of law. They also request access to prosecutorial records to demonstrate a pattern of selective prosecution, where other top Trump administration officials were not charged. The case raises significant questions about executive overreach, the integrity of prosecutorial independence, and the constitutional role of Senate confirmation in federal appointments.",
