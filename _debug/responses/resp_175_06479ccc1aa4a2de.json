  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire is progressing better than expected, according to US Vice President JD Vance, who visited Israel to assess its implementation. The truce remains fragile after a Hamas attack killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting Israeli air strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians. Despite this, Hamas has returned the bodies of 13 of the 28 deceased Israeli hostages, and the US continues to pressure Hamas to disarm, warning that non-compliance may result in its complete destruction. Meanwhile, humanitarian efforts by the UN’s World Food Programme have delivered over 6,700 tonnes of food to Gaza, though only two crossings remain open—both in the south—leaving northern Gaza with dire shortages. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are engaging with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push forward on long-term peace measures, including an interim Palestinian government and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The ceasefire, based on the first phase of Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, faces ongoing challenges related to security, compliance, and aid access.",
