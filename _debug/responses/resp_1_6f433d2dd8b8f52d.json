He was arrested in Scotland in 2023 based on a distinctive tattoo and an Interpol notice, and extradited to Utah in January 2024. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence during the trial, but was found guilty by a jury. A Utah judge sentenced him to between five and life in prison, citing his status as a flight risk and serial abuser. The case highlights the dangers of rape kit backlogs, the use of aliases to evade justice, and the importance of international cooperation in tracking fugitives. The victims emphasized the long-term emotional trauma and a need for accountability and safety in the face of abuse.",
