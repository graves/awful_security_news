  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital Lima and the neighboring province of Callao to address a surge in crime, following deadly protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured. The emergency, approved by the Council of Ministers and effective just after midnight on October 21, 2025, authorizes the deployment of armed forces and police to restore public order. This move follows Jeri’s inauguration after the ousting of former President Dina Boluarte and comes amid growing public pressure from young people in the 'Generation Z' group who demand stronger measures against crime. The declaration echoes a previous emergency imposed by Boluarte in March, though experts argue that repeated such measures have not effectively reduced crime levels, raising questions about the long-term efficacy of emergency responses.",
