  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A preliminary investigation by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable in the Glória funicular in Lisbon failed to meet the safety specifications set by the operator, CARRIS, and was not certified to carry passengers. The cable snapped shortly after the funicular cars began their journey on Calçada da Glória, causing one car to derail and crash into a building, killing at least 16 people and injuring several others. Eyewitnesses, including Bruno, described the event as chaotic and sudden. The report also revealed serious maintenance failures, including false documentation of completed tasks and a maintenance plan falsely labeled as compliant. While the findings are preliminary and not conclusive, they highlight critical safety lapses in infrastructure operations and maintenance protocols, raising concerns about public transport safety in Portugal.",
