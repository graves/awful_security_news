  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Missouri, a growing public backlash against a new gerrymandered congressional map—signed into law by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe—has led to a grassroots campaign led by People Not Politicians Missouri to overturn it through a voter referendum. The map, which targets the long-standing Democratic district of Kansas City represented by Emanuel Cleaver II, has drawn opposition from both local voters and some Republican legislators, including Bill Allen and Jon Patterson. A coalition including the Democratic National Committee and activist Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan has joined the effort, citing concerns over dilution of voting power, lack of affordable housing, and mental health resources. The group has collected over 100,000 signatures, aiming to reach 106,000 by December 11, 2025, to qualify for a 2026 referendum. However, state officials including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins have challenged the referendum, claiming it violates constitutional law and that signatures were collected prematurely. The case underscores a broader national debate over whether redistricting should be a political act or a democratic process controlled by voters.",
