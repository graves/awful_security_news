  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, has been elected president of Bolivia in a decisive victory over former president Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of 20 years of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. With 54.5% of the vote, Paz’s win reflects widespread public anger over record inflation, fuel shortages, and economic mismanagement under MAS. His campaign, backed by rural and working-class voters, promotes a return to market-based reforms, including ending the fixed exchange rate and cutting fuel subsidies. However, he faces significant economic challenges, including depleted foreign reserves and inflation at 23%, and criticism over vague promises of social support. His running mate, former police officer Edman Lara, brought new energy through anti-corruption activism, though their campaign was marked by tensions. Paz’s victory signals a sharp political and economic shift, with hopes of restoring U.S. relations and ushering in a new era of governance. The new administration will take office on November 8, 2025, with the challenge of stabilizing the economy and maintaining social cohesion.",
