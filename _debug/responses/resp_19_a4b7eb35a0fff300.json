  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ange Postecoglou, the Australian football manager appointed by Nottingham Forest in late 2025, was dismissed after just 39 days in charge following a poor run of results, including a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea. He failed to win a single game during his tenure, drawing two and losing six, prompting the club to announce his immediate departure. This marks the shortest managerial tenure in Premier League history, beating Les Reed’s record by one day. The decision comes after the departure of previous manager Nuno Espírito Santo, who had led the club to its highest league finish in 30 years. The club's instability in leadership has now led to its third managerial change this season, with fans reportedly booing Postecoglou at the final game.",
