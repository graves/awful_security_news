  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ian Roberts, the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for unlawfully possessing firearms while in the country illegally. Originally from Guyana, Roberts worked in school districts across the U.S. for two decades before being hired in 2023. He was detained by ICE on September 26, 2023, after fleeing in a district-issued vehicle, where agents found a handgun wrapped in a towel. A federal indictment alleges he made a false attestation on an I-9 form and was in possession of four firearms—two pistols, a rifle, and a shotgun—after being found in a wooded area. Authorities previously rejected an appeal to reopen immigration proceedings, confirming his status as an illegal alien. The school district has filed a lawsuit against the consulting firm it used in the 2023 hiring process, citing concerns about improper promotion of Roberts. School board chair Jackie Norris initiated a review of Roberts’ expenditures and later ended her campaign for the U.S. Senate, highlighting public and political fallout from the incident.",
