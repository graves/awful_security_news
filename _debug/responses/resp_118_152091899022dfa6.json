  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a close and highly personal gubernatorial race in New Jersey in 2025, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has gained national support from President Donald Trump. Despite New Jersey’s historically blue political leanings, the race is seen as purple due to past alternation of party control. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, has drawn national endorsements from President Barack Obama and has criticized Ciattarelli’s past business dealings and ties to Trump, particularly over opioid-related claims. Ciattarelli, who previously called Trump a ‘charlatan,’ has been endorsed by Trump and has accused Sherrill of being barred from her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal. Both candidates are making strong personal attacks, with Ciattarelli threatening defamation lawsuits. Voter concerns center on affordability, including rising energy costs and property taxes. Experts like Ben Dworkin emphasize that despite political polarization, the electorate remains focused on economic issues. The race could result in the first time since the 1960s that a governor from the same party serves three consecutive terms.",
