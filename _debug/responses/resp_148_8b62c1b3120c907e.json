The mourning period, marked by massive public turnout including a 30km march from Nairobi, drew national and international attention. Odinga, a key architect of Kenya’s return to multiparty politics and the 2010 constitution, is widely revered as a champion of democracy and peaceful reconciliation. International figures like former U.S. President Barack Obama praised his legacy, while local officials like Siaya County Governor James Orengo called for public restraint. His body is being transported to his ancestral home in Bondo for burial, underscoring both the deep public affection and the political sensitivity surrounding his passing.",
