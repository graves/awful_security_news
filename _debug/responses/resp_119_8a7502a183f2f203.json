  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pickleball, now played by nearly 20 million Americans, has seen a sharp rise in eye injuries—up 405 cases annually from 2021 to 2024—according to a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology. The majority of injuries (70%) occur in adults 50 years or older, challenging the assumption that youth athletes are most at risk. Injuries stem from impacts with the ball, paddle, or falls due to the game’s fast pace and small court size. Experts including Dr. Corey Lacher and Dr. Daniel Henick emphasize that standard eye protection—especially shatter-resistant polycarbonate gear meeting ASTM F3164 standards—could prevent up to 90% of these injuries. A major barrier is lack of awareness among players, with many unaware of the risks. Recommendations include standardized guidelines, visible court signage, improved product accessibility, and role modeling by professional athletes. The study notes limitations, including a small sample and data from only participating emergency departments. Despite these, the key takeaway is the urgent need for public awareness and standardized safety protocols to prevent preventable, life-changing injuries.",
