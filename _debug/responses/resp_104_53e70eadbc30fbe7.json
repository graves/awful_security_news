    "The term 'enshittification' was coined by Cory Doctorow and has been widely adopted to describe the decline in quality of internet platforms over time.",
    "Doctorow identifies three stages of enshittification: (1) initial user-focused growth, (2) business-focused monetization, and (3) degradation of user and merchant experiences.",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples where enshittification is evident, especially in data practices, pricing models, and algorithmic bias.",
    "Amazon is accused of cloning products, charging junk fees (45–51 cents per dollar earned), and distorting search results (first result 29% more expensive than best match).",
    "Facebook is accused of altering feeds to promote ads, forcing publishers to publish longer content, and charging for boosted content.",
    "Doctorow attributes platform degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations.",
    "He proposes solutions such as 'right-to-exit' policies (e.g., taking e-books with you), increased interoperability between platforms, and a shift from the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article presents a theory of 'enshittification'—a concept coined by internet activist and author Cory Doctorow—arguing that major internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber have degraded in quality over time. Doctorow outlines a three-stage model: in Stage 1, platforms grow rapidly and serve users well with good experiences and low prices; in Stage 2, they shift focus to businesses, monetizing user data and content; in Stage 3, they begin to harm users and merchants through predatory pricing, manipulated algorithms, and hidden fees. The article highlights Amazon’s alleged practice of cloning products and charging junk fees (up to 51 cents per dollar), and Facebook’s manipulation of feeds to promote ads. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak regulation, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. He proposes solutions including a 'right-to-exit' policy and greater interoperability between platforms. While Amazon and Facebook have denied the claims, Doctorow supports them with studies and data, and the article reflects a broader public concern about platform power and the need for regulatory reform.",
