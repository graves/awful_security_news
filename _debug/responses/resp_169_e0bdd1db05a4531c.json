  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of sophisticated AI voice deepfakes have enabled fraudsters to impersonate real individuals, such as Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, to deceive wealthy businessmen into sending millions of euros. The scam, which occurred in early 2025, prompted public and governmental responses, with Crosetto publicly exposing the fraud. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voices are now nearly indistinguishable from human ones, with participants often trusting AI voices more than real ones. Global losses from deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. AI voice technology, while beneficial in restoring speech for those with speech disabilities, poses serious risks including identity theft, financial fraud, and the creation of illegal content like AI-generated child sexual abuse material. In response, governments such as the United States and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize the publication of AI-generated intimate images, reflecting growing international concern over the misuse of AI voice and video technology.",
