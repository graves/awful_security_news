  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In early October 2025, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg issued two memos requiring Pentagon officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—to obtain prior approval from the Department’s Legislative Affairs Office before communicating with Congress. This policy shift, described as a 'pragmatic step' by spokesman Sean Parnell, aims to improve accuracy and transparency in messaging. However, it sparked backlash when most Pentagon reporters chose to leave the building in protest of the new restrictions, suggesting concerns about reduced access to information and media freedom. The move appears part of a broader effort by Hegseth to centralize control over the Pentagon’s external communications, particularly with legislative bodies. The second memo established a working group to further define engagement guidelines, indicating ongoing policy refinement.",
