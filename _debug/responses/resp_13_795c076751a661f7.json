  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has officially stepped back from using his royal titles, including Duke of York, after years of public scrutiny stemming from allegations of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and ties to an alleged Chinese spy. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and the wider royal family, comes following a 2015 lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed Andrew was involved in sexual misconduct with underage girls. Despite his repeated denials, the controversy intensified after court documents revealed Prince Andrew's business dealings with Yang Tengbo, a man linked to Chinese investors. The prince will no longer attend royal events, such as Christmas celebrations, but will continue living at Royal Lodge and retain his title as 'Prince' due to his status as the son of Queen Elizabeth II. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will now be known without the title Duchess of York, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, keep their titles. Virginia Giuffre, who filed the lawsuit and died by suicide in April 2025, has left behind a posthumous memoir that further details her claims, adding emotional and legal significance to the ongoing debate.",
