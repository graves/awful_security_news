    "Paz’s party (PDC) won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which won 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate—meaning Paz lacks legislative majority and must form alliances to govern.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), won Bolivia’s presidential runoff in October 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The election was driven by widespread economic crisis, including high inflation, fuel scarcity, and declining natural gas exports. Paz’s moderate platform, emphasizing private sector growth and gradual reform, resonated with voters disillusioned by MAS policies but wary of austerity. While Paz’s party holds a narrow legislative majority, it lacks control over the legislature, forcing coalition-building. His campaign was energized by the populist appeal of running mate Edman Lara. Both candidates pledged to improve U.S. relations and seek American financial support. Paz plans a $1.5 billion economic deal with the U.S. to secure fuel and has committed to phasing out universal fuel subsidies, replacing them with targeted support. The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including securing fuel supplies, managing labor union opposition, and stabilizing a fragile economy.",
