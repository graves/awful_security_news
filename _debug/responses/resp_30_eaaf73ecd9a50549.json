  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following over a week of deadly clashes along their 1,600-mile disputed border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The violence, which began on October 10 after Afghanistan accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes in Paktika province, resulted in civilian deaths and widespread attacks on both sides. Pakistan claims it targeted only militant camps of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), while Afghanistan accused Pakistan of targeting civilians, including killing eight people, including three cricket players, during a gathering. As a result, Afghanistan has withdrawn from a planned T20I cricket tournament with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The ceasefire includes mutual commitments to refrain from attacking each other's security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure. This marks the deadliest escalation between the two nations since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and raises concerns about regional stability, especially given the ongoing threat posed by the TTP and the deep-rooted mistrust between the two neighbors.",
