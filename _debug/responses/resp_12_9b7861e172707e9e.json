  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes and other household items with cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline. The case began when Angela showed recurring symptoms after consuming shakes made by her husband. Over several days, Craig used multiple poisons, including potassium cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline from Visine eyedrops, which were purchased and stored with deceptive medical justifications. Digital evidence from a computer in his dental office showed searches for methods of murder and poison dosages, indicating premeditation. Key staff members, including Caitlin Romero and Dr. Ryan Redfearn, discovered suspicious deliveries and raised concerns, leading to the eventual investigation. Forensic toxicology confirmed lethal levels of all three poisons in Angela’s blood. The case underscores how calculated, methodical poisoning using common household items can go undetected until critical symptoms appear and staff raise alarms.",
