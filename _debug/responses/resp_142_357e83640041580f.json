  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil's Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating inside protected areas such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous Territory and Terra Nossa. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the lack of traceability in cattle movement, due to Brazil’s GTAs system, which only records group-level data and fails to track individual animals. Cattle from illegally deforested land are reportedly 'laundered' through a series of transfers that conceal their origins, allowing JBS to unknowingly supply products linked to deforestation. Despite past promises, including a 2009 agreement with Greenpeace to identify all indirect suppliers, JBS has not fulfilled these commitments. The article underscores that the current system of animal movement tracking in Brazil is inadequate, with experts calling for mandatory, public, and individual-level traceability mechanisms to be implemented urgently. With Pará experiencing a 421% increase in deforestation and illegal land grabs, and the upcoming COP30 climate summit in the region, the issue has significant global relevance, urging both corporate accountability and stronger governmental regulation.",
