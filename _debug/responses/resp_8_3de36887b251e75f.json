The stolen items are estimated at $102 million, with eight of nine items still missing. French prosecutors and officials, including Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and prosecutor Laure Beccuau, have acknowledged significant security failures and expressed concern over the potential dismantling and resale of the jewelry through black-market money laundering.
