  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with over 50 drones and missiles targeting power and heat facilities in a single night. These attacks, repeated over 15 days, are part of a strategy to inflict suffering through cold and terror. Ukrainian officials report that Russian drones continuously circulate over damaged sites, prolonging the humanitarian crisis. In response, Ukraine has launched retaliatory strikes, such as targeting the Bryansk Chemical Plant with Storm Shadow missiles. Despite hopes for U.S. support, Ukraine is not receiving Tomahawk cruise missiles and remains short on air defenses. President Volodymyr Zelensky is turning to Europe for urgent assistance, including financial support from frozen Russian assets, to fund air defense systems like the Patriot. The article highlights growing tensions over a possible Budapest summit with Putin, concerns about shifting U.S. diplomatic postures, and an analysis that Russian aggression increases when Western leaders express frustration. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya identifies a cyclical pattern: when U.S. leaders like Trump become frustrated, Russia escalates attacks, showing a calculated response to diplomatic shifts.",
