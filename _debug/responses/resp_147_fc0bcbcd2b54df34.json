  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Officials from the United States and Russia have dismissed plans for a near-term summit between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin, despite Trump’s earlier announcement of a meeting in Hungary within two weeks. The delay stems from deep disagreements over ceasefire conditions, with Russia demanding control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and retaining occupied territories—positions that conflict with Trump’s call to freeze battle lines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov maintains that Moscow’s position has not changed since the Alaska summit, while US officials and European leaders criticize Russia’s stalling tactics and ongoing aggression. A planned preparatory meeting between US Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov was canceled after a phone call, and Ukraine insists on direct talks with Putin, which Russia has ruled out until a practical peace deal is reached.",
