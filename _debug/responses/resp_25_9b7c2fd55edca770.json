  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents in Beverly Hills, have been resentenced by Judge Michael Jesic to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The brothers, who previously served life without parole, took full responsibility for the killings, citing years of childhood sexual abuse and self-defense. Family members and prison staff testified to their remorse, rehabilitation, and positive contributions to prison life, including Erik’s support groups and Lyle’s beautification program. While the Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing due to claims of fabricated abuse and a moderate risk of recidivism, the state parole board has recommended that the brothers be considered for parole, with a June 13 hearing scheduled. The final decision rests with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who holds the power to approve or deny parole and has not yet acted. The brothers have also filed a habeas corpus petition seeking a new trial, citing new evidence of abuse by their father. The case reflects broader debates about justice, rehabilitation, and the role of trauma in criminal behavior.",
