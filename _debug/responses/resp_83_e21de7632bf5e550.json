    "The Supreme Court agreed to review whether the federal government can bar habitual drug users from possessing guns, citing concerns about public safety and armed encounters with law enforcement.",
    "The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the United States and Pakistan, who was indicted in 2023 after marijuana and cocaine were found at his home, with the prosecution based on his habitual drug use.",
    "A federal district court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court decision that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots, and the 5th Circuit upheld that reasoning, ruling that laws targeting habitual users are not historically grounded.",
    "The Trump administration appealed the 5th Circuit's decision, arguing that habitual drug users with firearms pose a significant risk to society and law enforcement, especially when impaired.",
    "The DOJ claims Hemani was involved in fraud linked to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps affiliates and attended a celebration of Qasem Soleimani, a key figure in Iran, though Hemani disputes these claims.",
    "Hemani’s legal team argues that the historical basis for the law is weak, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana, suggesting a significant overlap between legal marijuana users and gun possession.",
    "The case is significant because it extends the ongoing national debate over the Second Amendment and the limits of federal law, especially in light of the previous Supreme Court’s 2022 decision and the Biden administration’s pardon of Hunter Biden for a similar offense.",
    "This case is part of a broader trend of the Supreme Court examining gun rights and restrictions, including a separate case on whether states may restrict gun carrying on private property without owner consent."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing guns, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Pakistan, who was indicted in 2023 for marijuana and cocaine found at his home. The prosecution rests on his habitual drug use, but a lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court precedent that requires such gun prohibitions to have historical roots. The Trump administration appealed, arguing that habitual drug users with firearms pose a public safety risk, especially when impaired, and that such prohibitions are necessary to protect law enforcement. The case is further complicated by the fact that Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned. The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments in 2026 and issue a decision by the end of June. The outcome could significantly shape future interpretations of the Second Amendment and the limits of federal gun regulations, especially in light of growing state legalization of marijuana.",
