  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "North Korea conducted multiple short-range ballistic missile tests just before the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, marking the first such launches under President Lee Jae-myung’s administration. The missiles, which flew approximately 350km and fell inland, were detected by South Korea’s military, which has increased surveillance in anticipation of further activity. Experts interpret the launch as a deliberate act by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to assert the regime’s presence and strength during a major international diplomatic gathering. This comes after North Korea’s display of its long-range Hwasong-20 missile in a military parade, signaling continued advancement in its nuclear delivery capabilities. The timing—just one week before the summit—raises concerns about regional stability, as leaders from the US, China, and other nations gather in Seoul. North Korea maintains that its weapons development is a defensive necessity, and while diplomatic talks with the US under former President Donald Trump are possible, the regime insists on retaining its nuclear arsenal.",
