The incident occurred during a period of increased EU-wide efforts to phase out Russian energy imports, making Hungary’s continued reliance on Russian oil a notable policy anomaly. MOL, Hungary’s state-owned energy company, confirmed the fire, stated that emergency protocols were followed, and emphasized that domestic fuel supplies remain secure, potentially using strategic reserves. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán affirmed fuel security and declared the investigation into the blaze ongoing. Air quality monitoring found no health risks, and eyewitnesses reported visible flames and smoke over several kilometers. The fire underscores Hungary’s unique energy strategy in contrast to the rest of Europe, and highlights the risks associated with dependence on foreign energy sources amid geopolitical shifts.",
