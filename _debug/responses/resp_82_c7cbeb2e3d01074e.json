  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman reported missing in Philadelphia on October 4, 2025, were found in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school after a new anonymous tip led investigators to return to the site. DNA tests confirmed her identity. Keon King, a 21-year-old man from Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and other offenses. Prosecutors allege that King had cellphone contact with Scott and that a stolen black Hyundai Accent was seen at a recreation center on the night of her disappearance. The vehicle later caught fire and was destroyed, preventing a full inspection. King had a prior arrest in a similar case, though charges were dropped due to non-appearance of witnesses. Authorities believe others may have been involved, and homicide charges are under consideration. The case has drawn significant public attention due to the emotional impact on Scott’s family and the strong evidence linking King to the timeline and location of her disappearance.",
