  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Hamas has returned the remains of two more Israeli captives killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, bringing the total number of returned bodies to 12 out of 28 as part of a ceasefire agreement. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insists that all 28 bodies must be returned before honoring ceasefire commitments such as opening the Rafah border crossing or allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. Hamas claims that recovery efforts are hampered by a lack of equipment and infrastructure in Gaza, while Israel accuses Hamas of delaying the return of all remains. The situation remains tense, with both sides blaming each other for ceasefire violations, and humanitarian aid continues to be blocked despite sufficient supply for three months. The fragile ceasefire underscores deep mistrust and unresolved issues over accountability, access, and human rights.",
