  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox in California — the first suspected cases of local transmission — have raised public health concerns, though officials stress the risk to the general population remains low. These cases differ from previous U.S. cases, which were all among international travelers. Both individuals were hospitalized and are now recovering at home; no close contact link has been confirmed. Health officials in Long Beach and Los Angeles County are investigating further, with a few close contacts vaccinated as a precaution. Experts warn that the emergence of a new clade I variant in the U.S. could signal community spread, especially given the ongoing federal government shutdown and reduced CDC capacity. The article underscores the importance of surveillance and public health infrastructure, especially when new viral strains emerge in the absence of full operational capacity.",
