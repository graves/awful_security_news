  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance visited Israel to reassure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the US commitment to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, downplaying concerns over its fragility despite private administration worries. Following a Hamas-linked attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, both sides accused each other of violations, yet reaffirmed their commitment to the truce. Vance declined to set deadlines for Hamas disarmament or hostage return, emphasizing the need for time and infrastructure. Trump, meanwhile, suggested the attack was not orchestrated by Hamas leadership, called for possible 'eradication' of Hamas, and signaled to allies that they may enter Gaza to intervene. The US, through Witkoff and Kushner, is pushing for proportionate responses and a stable ceasefire, with the next 30 days seen as critical for the deal to survive and for negotiations to advance to a reconstruction phase. Israeli officials are demanding US pressure to demilitarize Hamas before talks move forward.",
