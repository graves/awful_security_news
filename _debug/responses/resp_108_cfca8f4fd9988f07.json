    "The project includes 22 cast concrete cars arranged in an underwater traffic jam, which act as coral habitats due to their structural design.",
    "Artist Leandro Ehrlich contributes to the project, believing that over time, corals will cover and transform the sculptures, making them disappear.",
    "Reefline aims to restore a historic coral reef that once existed off Miami Beach but was buried by sand in the 1970s.",
    "The project is funded by a $5 million Miami Beach city bond and requires an additional $6 million in private fundraising for its first phase.",
    "A marine learning center will be established on land to educate visitors about coral reef conservation and climate change.",
    "Future phases may include a constellation of 57 giant starfish sculptures, which could one day symbolize the city of Miami Beach."

Led by artist and cultural placemaker Ximena Caminos and coral scientist Colin Foord, the project includes a coral nursery, public access for swimmers, and an onshore marine learning center to educate the public. Funded by a $5 million city bond and seeking an additional $6 million in private funds, the first phase will begin this month and is expected to take at least a decade to complete. Over time, the sculptures will be colonized by coral, transforming into vibrant underwater ecosystems and potentially becoming symbolic landmarks for Miami Beach.",
