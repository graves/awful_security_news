  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Donald Trump has repeatedly used the phrase 'common sense' as a core political strategy, particularly in justifying controversial policies and dismissing opposition as ideological or nonsensical. Drawing on historical roots in Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet, the article highlights how 'common sense' serves as a populist rhetorical tool that appeals to rural voters, older demographics, and those who identify with the 'Make America Great Again' ideology. The phrase is used across various contexts—such as advising pregnant women not to take Tylenol, questioning economic data, and justifying the deployment of the National Guard in cities—often to signal that a policy is intuitive, timeless, and widely shared. While Democrats have also employed the phrase in policy proposals like gun reform and healthcare, Trump's usage is more demagogic and expansive, framing opposition as outside the mainstream. The article concludes that 'common sense' has become one of the most powerful and controversial rhetorical tools in the MAGA movement.",
