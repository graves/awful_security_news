  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing—traditionally the base of operations for the first lady—to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates major renovations to federal buildings. President Donald Trump announced the project, claiming it would accommodate up to 999 people and would not interfere with the main structure of the White House. The demolition has been carried out without formal review, with the White House arguing that site preparation and demolition fall outside the commission’s jurisdiction. The East Wing, built in 1902, will be temporarily relocated, and offices will be moved during construction. Carrier Global Corp. has donated an energy-efficient HVAC system. The project, which began with site preparation in September 2025, is scheduled to be completed before Trump’s term ends in January 2029. The move has sparked controversy over transparency, federal oversight, and historical preservation, with questions about whether private funding can justify bypassing official approval processes.",
