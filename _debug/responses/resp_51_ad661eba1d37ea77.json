  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli soldier killed on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack on a kibbutz, has been identified and returned to Israel for burial as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. He is the 13th deceased hostage to be transferred since the ceasefire was signed on October 9, 2025. The IDF confirmed the identification through forensic examination, and the body was retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza and delivered to Israeli authorities. This transfer comes amid ongoing diplomatic pressure, with Israel accusing Hamas of failing to locate and return all deceased hostages due to destruction in Gaza. One previously handed-over body was not an Israeli hostage, raising concerns about misidentification. US officials, including President Donald Trump, have warned of military action against Hamas if it violates the ceasefire, and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have held high-level meetings with Israeli military leaders to reinforce compliance. The return of Haimi’s body underscores both the emotional and political dimensions of the hostage crisis and the fragile enforcement of the ceasefire agreement.",
