The island, frequently the first landmass hit by western Pacific cyclones, has conducted repeated evacuation drills to prepare for such events. This storm comes amid a period of ongoing natural disasters, including deadly earthquakes in Cebu and southern regions and Typhoon Ragasa in September, which already caused deaths and mass evacuations. Scientists link the increasing intensity of such storms to climate change, emphasizing the growing vulnerability of disaster-prone, impoverished communities in the Philippines.",
