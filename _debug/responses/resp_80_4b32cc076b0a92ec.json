  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 20, 2025, the body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, one of 28 hostages taken during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack, was formally identified by Israeli authorities after being returned by Hamas. The return of his body, along with that of Ronen Engel — a 54-year-old Israeli man whose wife and daughters were released — brings the total number of identified deceased hostages to 12. The ceasefire in Gaza, which began last week, is under increasing strain due to the slow return of remaining bodies, continued Israeli military strikes, and Hamas's claims that it has returned all accessible remains. The US State Department warns of a possible Hamas ceasefire violation, while both sides accuse each other of breach: Hamas says it has fulfilled its obligations, and Israel claims Hamas is using the bodies as leverage. The Rafah crossing remains closed, cutting off humanitarian aid, and protests have erupted in Israel as families demand full accountability. The Israeli government insists the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed.",
