    "A Slovak court found Juraj Cintula guilty of terrorism charges in connection with an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, shot Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter.",
    "Fico was seriously injured, with wounds to his abdomen, hip, hand, and foot, and made a public appearance months after the attack.",
    "The court determined that the attack targeted a political leader specifically, not a random citizen, justifying the terrorism classification.",
    "Cintula claimed he aimed to stop Fico’s policies, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The prosecution argued Cintula’s actions constituted terrorism, while the defense contended that attacks on public officials are not inherently terrorism.",

    "Fico has forgiven Cintula despite the severe injury and ongoing health issues.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 in the town of Handlova. The attack, which wounded Fico severely, was deemed a terrorism offense by the Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica, due to the specific targeting of a political leader. Cintula claimed his motive was to oppose Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom. The verdict highlights deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico accusing the opposition of fueling anger and the opposition criticizing Fico for undermining democracy. Despite the serious consequences, Fico has forgiven Cintula, and the case underscores the tension between political activism and violence in democratic societies.",
