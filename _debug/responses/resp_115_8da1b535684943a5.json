  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how President Donald Trump has consistently conflated urban crime with illegal immigration, using this narrative to justify the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in cities across the U.S., including Chicago, Memphis, D.C., and Portland. Despite legal constraints — such as the National Guard’s inability to make arrests — these deployments are being used to support immigration enforcement operations, including guarding ICE facilities and protecting agents during raids. The actions have caused significant fear among immigrant and U.S. resident communities, who cannot distinguish between ICE agents and National Guard troops. Experts and advocacy groups argue that the administration is using public protests and rising immigration enforcement as a pretext for military mobilization, while data show that violent crime has actually decreased in many cities. The article highlights legal challenges, such as court rulings that the use of National Guard troops in domestic policing violates the Posse Comitatus Act, and raises broader concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the blurring of lines between law enforcement and immigration enforcement.",
