Despite only a small number of supporters signing up with the DSA at his rally, the campaign has catalyzed a surge in DSA membership, with national numbers reaching 80,000 and a dramatic increase in grassroots organizing and volunteer engagement. The article highlights growing public support for socialist ideas—evidenced by a Gallup poll showing declining approval of capitalism and rising support for socialism among Democrats—while also revealing internal tensions within the DSA, including ideological purism, de-endorsements of figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and debates over the party’s stance on Israel and Palestine. Other progressive candidates, such as Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson, are now attempting to replicate Mamdani’s success by leveraging DSA energy and socialist values in local politics, even without formal membership. The article concludes that democratic socialism is no longer a fringe movement but a growing political force responding to voter demands for systemic change, economic justice, and a new kind of political leadership.",
