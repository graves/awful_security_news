  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, who had been sentenced to over seven years for fraud and identity theft, including fabricating his background and stealing donors' identities. Santos, expelled from Congress after revelations of false claims about his education, employment, and religious identity, was released from FCI Fairton, New Jersey, on October 17, 2025. The commutation, which erased all fines, restitution, and probation, drew both praise and criticism within the Republican Party, with some, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, supporting it as a matter of justice, while others, such as Nick LaLota, argued the crimes warranted greater punishment. Trump justified the decision by comparing Santos’ deception to past misstatements by Senator Richard Blumenthal, and the move reflects a broader pattern of executive clemency for former Republican politicians since Trump's return to office in January 2025.",
