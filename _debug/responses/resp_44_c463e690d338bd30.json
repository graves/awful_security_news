    "A Slovak court sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024.",
    "Cintula shot Prime Minister Fico five times from a distance of just over one meter during a public greeting in Handlova, injuring Fico severely in the abdomen, hip, hand, and foot.",
    "The court ruled that Cintula's act constituted terrorism, citing his targeting of a political leader and his stated motive of opposing Fico's policies on Ukraine, media, and culture.",
    "Cintula claimed he did not intend to kill Fico but to stop his policies, which he believed were damaging Slovak freedom and culture.",
    "The verdict has highlighted deep societal divisions in Slovakia, especially between Fico’s populist government and the liberal, pro-EU opposition, which accuses Fico of undermining democratic standards and media freedom.",
    "Fico, who has been in power since 2006, has faced criticism for ending state military aid to Ukraine, strengthening ties with Moscow, and reforming public broadcasting, measures seen as anti-democratic by opponents.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on public officials are terrorism, but the court found that the specific targeting of a political leader with political motives justified the terrorism classification.",
    "Fico has expressed forgiveness toward Cintula, despite ongoing health complications from the attack.",
    "Cintula plans to appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust' and stating he will challenge the terrorism designation."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula shot Fico five times, seriously injuring him, and claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and cultural freedom. The court ruled that the act constituted terrorism, not merely a criminal attack on a public official, citing the targeted nature of the attack and Cintula’s political motivation. The verdict highlights deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico’s government accused of undermining democratic norms and media freedom, while opposition parties accuse him of eroding liberal values. Fico has forgave Cintula, and Cintula plans to appeal the sentence, calling it unjust. The case underscores tensions between populist governance and democratic standards in Central Europe.",
