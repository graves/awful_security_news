  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A daring daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris saw four masked thieves steal high-value historical jewellery—including a necklace from Emperor Napoleon and a tiara from Empress Eugenie—valued at €88 million. Using a modified truck and power tools, the thieves gained access to the Galerie d'Apollon in under eight minutes, threatening guards and escaping on scooters. Security failures, including missing CCTV and a non-triggering alarm system, allowed the heist to occur. Experts fear the jewellery has already been melted down and sold, as the thieves likely did not intend to keep the full value. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have condemned the attack as a serious threat to national heritage, prompting urgent security reforms across France's cultural institutions.",
