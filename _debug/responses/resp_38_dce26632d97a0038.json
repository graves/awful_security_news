  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar actions in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that protests against ICE agents constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president has exclusive authority to determine such emergencies, relying on the precedent of Martin v. Mott (1827). Lower courts, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, have blocked the deployment, claiming that protests do not equate to riots and that state and local law enforcement are sufficient. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision quickly, with implications for future National Guard deployments across the U.S., as the ruling could set a precedent for executive power in domestic emergencies.",
