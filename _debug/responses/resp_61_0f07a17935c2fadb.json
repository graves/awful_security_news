  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated by over a billion Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists worldwide on October 20, 2025. Rooted in myths of light triumphing over darkness, the festival spans five days, each with unique traditions: Dhanteras (buying gold and cleaning), Choti Diwali (Krishna’s defeat of Narakasura), Diwali (Lakshmi Puja and family gatherings), Padwa (marital love and Govardhan Hill story), and Bhai Dooj (sibling bonds). While primarily religious, Diwali has become a cultural celebration transcending faith, observed in India, Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji, and beyond. Key religious interpretations include Rama and Sita’s return, the liberation of Guru Hargobind and 52 kings (Sikhs), Lord Mahavira’s enlightenment (Jains), and Emperor Ashoka’s embrace of Buddhism (Buddhists). Traditions such as diyas, rangoli, and fireworks reflect both spiritual and social values, and the festival marks the start of a new financial year in many communities.",
