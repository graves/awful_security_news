The controversy highlights a broader shift among tech leaders in the Bay Area toward supporting Trump’s policies. Additionally, internal reports indicate that Salesforce has historically supported ICE operations, including using AI to evaluate tips and improve deportation efforts, raising ethical and political questions about the company’s alignment with federal enforcement agendas.",
