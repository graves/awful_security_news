    "A 155mm artillery shell fired by the US Marine Corps during a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, prematurely detonated over I-5 interstate, causing shrapnel to strike a California Highway Patrol cruiser.",
    "The demonstration occurred despite the fact that the route over I-5 had not been used since the 1950s, making it an unusual and potentially dangerous training exercise.",
    "The incident raised safety concerns, especially given that the same batch of shells had previously fired successfully the day before, and no injuries were reported, but shrapnel damage was confirmed.",
    "The US has significantly increased 155mm shell production since 2022, with over 3 million rounds sent to Ukraine, and there have been prior manufacturing issues such as cracked shells and changes in explosive composition.",
    "In 2024, a Reuters investigation found that the US initially switched from TNT to a more accident-resistant explosive in shells, then reverted to TNT during the Ukraine war for cost and production efficiency, raising questions about shell stability and safety.",
    "California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the firing over the highway as 'dangerous' and ordered the closure of I-5 ahead of the event, while Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended it as an established safe practice.",
    "A retired Marine Corps colonel, Mark Cancian, noted that while the shells were fired high and should not have posed a risk, the premature detonation was abnormal and indicates a potential flaw in manufacturing or handling.",
    "The shell batch was likely frozen and will not be reused until further investigation confirms safety."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th-anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate, a route not used since the 1950s. A 155mm artillery shell fired by an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the highway, causing shrapnel to strike and damage a California Highway Patrol cruiser. The event occurred despite Governor Gavin Newsom's concerns and highway closure, with Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defending it as a standard safe practice. The same shell batch had previously fired successfully the day before, raising questions about manufacturing consistency. A 2024 Reuters investigation found past issues with shell manufacturing and explosive changes, including a switch from TNT to a more stable explosive and later a return to TNT for cost and production efficiency. Experts, including retired Marine Corps colonel Mark Cancian, stress that while high-flying shells should not pose a danger, the premature detonation is abnormal and raises serious safety concerns, with the shell batch now likely being frozen and not reused until further investigation is completed.",
