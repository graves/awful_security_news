  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has stated he did not want a 'wasted meeting' after plans for a face-to-face summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin were shelved. The US and Russia remain at odds over the core issue of a ceasefire at the current front line, with Moscow insisting on full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the Donbas and recognition of Russian sovereignty, while Ukraine and allies back freezing the front line as a necessary first step. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was canceled after being deemed 'productive,' and Trump has publicly embraced a ceasefire proposal that would halt fighting along the existing battle lines. European leaders, including Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, have criticized Russia for avoiding diplomacy, asserting that only the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine could force a genuine discussion. The cancellation of the Budapest summit appears to stem from mutual distrust, particularly following speculation about US missile deployments, which Russia interpreted as a direct threat and may have prompted engagement. Despite these developments, the broader peace process remains stalled, highlighting deep structural disagreements over the future of the war in Ukraine.",
