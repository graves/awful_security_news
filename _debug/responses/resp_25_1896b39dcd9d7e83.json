Zalmanovich, a 85-year-old farmer and founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz, was believed killed in captivity on November 17, 2023, while Adar, a 38-year-old educator and nature lover, died during the initial assault. Their remains were transported to Israel for identification and burial. This return follows a US-proposed ceasefire agreement signed on October 9, 2025, which required Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours. However, Israel and the US have expressed concerns that some bodies remain unrecovered or were misidentified, and US Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the immense difficulty of retrieving bodies buried under rubble, stating that recovery will not happen overnight. The event underscores both the human and political dimensions of the hostage crisis and the fragile implementation of ceasefire agreements.",
