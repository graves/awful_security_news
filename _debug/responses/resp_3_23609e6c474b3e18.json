  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is on track to become a hurricane by Saturday, raising significant concerns for the northern Caribbean, particularly Hispaniola, where heavy rainfall and dangerous mudslides are predicted. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica, while Puerto Rico may receive substantial rain. The storm’s exact track remains uncertain, with two main scenarios under consideration: one where it turns north toward Hispaniola, and another where it moves west toward Central America. The storm’s development is fueled by extremely warm Caribbean Sea waters, a trend linked to global warming and observed in other recent hurricanes. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, there is a low but non-zero chance, especially in a late turn scenario. The article highlights Melissa as the first named storm to form in the Caribbean Sea this season, emphasizing broader climate-driven trends in storm intensification.",
