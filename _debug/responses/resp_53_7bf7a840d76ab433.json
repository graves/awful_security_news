  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a formal legal defense against federal charges alleging false statements and obstruction of Congress, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated, personal vendetta by President Donald Trump. His attorneys claim that Trump has consistently targeted Comey for his public criticism, citing a pattern of personal attacks. They also argue that the appointment of White House adviser Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney was unlawful, as it violated the constitutional requirement of Senate confirmation after the 120-day interim limit had passed. The defense contends that such an appointment circumvents Congressional oversight and constitutes an abuse of power, drawing a parallel to the earlier dismissal of Trump’s own indictment, where a judge found the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith unlawful. The case raises significant constitutional and political questions about executive overreach and the protection of free speech in the face of retaliation.",
