  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare ceasefire zones between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The plant has been without off-site power for four weeks—the longest blackout since the war began—forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that repairs to damaged power lines are now being carried out, with both sides accusing each other of causing the outage: Ukraine claims Russia intentionally cut power to test reconnection, while Russia blames Ukrainian shelling. This marks the 10th grid failure at ZNPP since the war began, and Russia has continued targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including a strike on a Slavutych substation that impacted the Chernobyl site. The IAEA has played a key role in mediating between the warring parties to allow safety-critical repairs to proceed, emphasizing the urgent need for nuclear safety and the risks posed by ongoing military aggression.",
