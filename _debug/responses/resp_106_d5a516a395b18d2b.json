  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Biden, has left the Democratic Party and now identifies as an independent, citing internal disunity, political disloyalty, and failure to anticipate the 2024 election outcome as key reasons. In her new book, Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, she reflects on the June 2024 presidential debate, where she observed former President Biden's health and noted public scrutiny over his age and fitness. She attributes the Democratic Party's defeat to a lack of unity, exemplified by public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney expressing doubts about Biden. Jean-Pierre also details the bias she faced as a Black woman in a predominantly white, male political space, and expresses deep appreciation for the visibility of Black women and other marginalized communities within the Biden-Harris administration. Ultimately, her decision to become independent is not a political defection but a call for accountability and political reimagining, urging the public to engage in political discourse and reject silence in the face of threats such as Project 2025 and anti-DEI policies.",
