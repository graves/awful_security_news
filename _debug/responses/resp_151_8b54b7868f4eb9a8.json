  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli forces killed 11 members of a Palestinian family in Gaza City, marking the deadliest single breach of the fragile ceasefire that began eight days earlier. The attack occurred when Israeli tanks fired on a civilian vehicle carrying the Abu Shaaban family in Zeitoun, violating the agreed 'yellow line' demarcation. Hamas condemned the incident as a 'massacre' and called on U.S. President Donald Trump and mediators to pressure Israel to comply with the ceasefire. Meanwhile, Israel has continued to block key border crossings like Rafah and has not allowed international machinery to recover bodies buried under rubble, hindering both humanitarian aid delivery and victim recovery. Humanitarian conditions remain dire, with only 560 tonnes of food delivered daily and 49% of Gazans receiving less than six litres of water per day. Bodies of Palestinian victims show signs of torture, and Israel has returned 135 bodies under the ceasefire, including 15 with unidentified identities. The situation underscores deepening violations, humanitarian collapse, and a growing crisis of trust in ceasefire mechanisms.",
