  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon used in multiple global conflicts, remains a key point of discussion in the ongoing war with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for the delivery of Tomahawks to enable Ukraine to strike deep inside Russian territory—such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov—aiming to inflict damage and pressure Russia into negotiations. However, the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, has stated that few Tomahawks are available for export due to domestic military needs. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-based launch system, such as the Typhon, to use the missiles effectively. While Ukraine has developed its own Flamingo cruise missile with similar range, its capabilities remain unclear and unproven. The Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin and SVR head Sergey Naryshkin, has reacted with alarm, viewing the potential delivery as a hostile act that could trigger war and threaten global security. Despite the strategic potential of the Tomahawk, Ukraine currently relies on drones and air defenses, and the primary need remains robust, scalable air defense systems to counter Russia’s growing missile and drone attacks.",
