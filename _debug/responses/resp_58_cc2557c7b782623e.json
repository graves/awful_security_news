  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes Donald Trump’s response to the 'No Kings' protests, where millions of Americans protested against his perceived authoritarianism and monarchy-style rule. Trump and Vice President JD Vance mocked the protests with AI-generated memes depicting him as a king, reinforcing a narrative of unchecked executive power. This behavior, combined with Trump’s commutation of George Santos’ sentence and unilateral military actions in the Caribbean and Venezuela, signals a growing erosion of constitutional norms and democratic oversight. Protests, which drew over 7 million participants, reflect broad public concern about the health of American democracy. Key figures like Rand Paul, Mike Johnson, and civil rights leaders challenge the administration’s actions as illegal and politically motivated. The article concludes that Trump’s behavior — including contempt for dissent and refusal to engage with democratic norms — is not only undermining public trust but also proving the protesters’ point: the U.S. is moving toward an autocratic model.",
