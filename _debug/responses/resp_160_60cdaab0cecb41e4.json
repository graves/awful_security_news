  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food supplies to Gaza remain critically low, with only 750 metric tonnes of food entering daily—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two border crossings being open. Despite a ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump, access remains severely restricted, especially in northern Gaza where aid has not reached in large convoys. The WFP operates 26 distribution points, still far short of the planned 145, and many Palestinians are storing food due to fears of renewed conflict. The Rafah crossing remains closed until Hamas delivers the bodies of deceased captives, and humanitarian access is limited by political and military conditions. The article emphasizes the urgent need for more open crossings and sustained political agreements to prevent famine.",
