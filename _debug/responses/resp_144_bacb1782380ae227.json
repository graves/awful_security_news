    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, and already restricted seven others: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium.",
    "The restrictions apply to both rare-earth metals and specialized equipment used to refine them, with foreign companies needing special approvals to export products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals.",
    "China cited national security and international non-proliferation concerns, particularly citing direct or indirect transfers of controlled rare-earth materials to military or sensitive applications.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth of rare-earth minerals and products in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports originating from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are critical for defence technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, Virginia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, and AI semiconductors, making them strategically vital.",
    "The move is seen as a 'signaling manoeuvre' by China to strengthen its leverage ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting during the APEC summit in South Korea, where such actions are viewed as part of pre-meeting diplomacy.",
    "Analysts, including Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS and Kristin Vekasi of the University of Montana, state that the restrictions deepen US industrial vulnerabilities and could accelerate China's military capabilities, undermining US efforts to build domestic supply resilience.",
    "The restrictions do not apply to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief, ensuring humanitarian exceptions."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, adding five new metals—holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium—to its existing restrictions on seven others, bringing total restrictions to 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals. These controls, announced by the Ministry of Commerce and effective from December 1, 2025, apply to both metals and specialized refining equipment. Foreign companies must obtain special approvals to export products containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals, with uses being scrutinized for military or sensitive applications. China cites national security and non-proliferation concerns, noting unauthorized transfers of materials to military entities. The move comes just weeks before US President Donald Trump’s visit to South Korea for the APEC summit, where he is set to meet President Xi Jinping. Analysts interpret the action as a strategic signaling maneuver to strengthen China’s leverage in upcoming trade talks, especially given the US’s heavy reliance on Chinese rare-earth supplies—70% of which were sourced from China between 2020 and 2023—used in critical defence systems like F-35 jets, submarines, and AI semiconductors, as well as in consumer technologies such as electric vehicles and LED screens. While humanitarian exemptions for emergency medical or disaster relief are maintained, the restrictions deepen global supply chain vulnerabilities and could accelerate China’s military and technological capabilities at the expense of US industrial resilience.",
