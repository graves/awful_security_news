  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major military operation on October 21, 2025, Myanmar’s armed forces arrested over 2,198 people, including 445 women and 1,645 men, at KK Park—a notorious scam centre in Myawaddy Township, Kayin State, near the Thai border. The site, spanning over 250 low-rise buildings, has long been used by international criminal syndicates for illegal gambling, money laundering, and online romance and investment scams. The military seized 30 Starlink satellites, which are used to maintain internet connectivity for scam operations. The raid reportedly targeted top leaders of the Karen National Union, linking armed conflict with criminal enterprises. The operation comes amid growing international pressure from Thailand and China, especially after Chinese actor Wang Xing was trafficked and rescued in January 2025. Human rights groups warn that many employees are victims of trafficking, lured by false job promises and forced into slave-like conditions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has also sanctioned over 20 individuals and companies in Myanmar and Cambodia linked to scam operations, underscoring the global scale and severity of the issue.",
