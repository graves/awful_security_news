  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced the termination of all US payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to combat drug production, despite years of financial support. The move escalates a long-standing diplomatic rift between the two leaders, rooted in disagreements over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean. Colombia, the world’s top cocaine producer, has been a key US ally in South America, with the US providing over $210 million in assistance this fiscal year. Trump warned Petro that US military action would close down drug production zones, while Petro responded by invoking Colombian literature and criticizing US foreign policy as greedy and ignorant. The situation reflects a broader ideological clash between Trump's punitive approach and Petro’s socialist, humanitarian vision for governance.",
