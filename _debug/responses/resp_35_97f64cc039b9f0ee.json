  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges of lying and obstruction during congressional testimony, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His legal team claims that Trump’s personal attacks on Comey, including public posts, demonstrate a clear intent to punish him for protected speech. Additionally, they argue that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney violated the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause, as her appointment came after the 120-day limit for interim roles, circumventing Senate confirmation. The case raises critical constitutional and political questions about executive power, retaliation, and the legitimacy of prosecutorial appointments in response to political criticism.",
