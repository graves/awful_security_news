  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the midst of a federal government shutdown, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the U.S., including individuals from New York such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, organized a bipartisan citizen lobbying effort in Washington, D.C. Despite their diverse political affiliations — Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing is a Democrat, and Martin did not discuss her politics — all shared a personal experience with cancer. The event, organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, focused on urging Congress to increase cancer research funding, expand access to cancer screening, and retain health insurance subsidies. Volunteers visited 484 congressional offices, demonstrating that shared personal trauma can transcend political differences. A candlelight vigil on the National Mall memorialized 10,000 individuals affected by cancer. The article highlights the power of personal experience to foster empathy, and underscores a broad public consensus that cancer-related policies are a priority across party lines, even as national politics remain deeply divided.",
