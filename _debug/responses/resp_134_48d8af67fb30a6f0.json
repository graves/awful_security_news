The shutdown is causing severe disruptions: federal workers are facing missed paychecks, key programs like WIC and Head Start are at risk, and agencies such as the FAA and the National Nuclear Security Administration are experiencing operational problems. The Nov. 1 ACA enrollment deadline adds urgency, as millions will enroll without expanded subsidies. The White House lunch meeting with Trump is expected to be a display of Republican unity, not a breakthrough in negotiations. Both sides remain entrenched, with Republicans citing lack of Democratic engagement and Democrats accusing Trump of inaction. The situation remains unresolved, with no clear path to a bipartisan resolution.",
