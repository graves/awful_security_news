The ban, led by Deputy Mayor Noel Duque and communicated through RTVE, is based on increased adoption requests during Halloween and past reports of cruelty. While black cats are traditionally linked to witchcraft in Western cultures, other cultures like Japan and Egypt view them as symbols of good fortune. Terrassa, home to over 9,800 cats and 12 black cats in its adoption center, implemented the measure as a precautionary, temporary, and exceptional step to protect animal welfare, with exceptions evaluated individually and normal adoption resuming after the period.",
