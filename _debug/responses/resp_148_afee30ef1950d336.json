The plan includes ending new Russian gas contracts from January 2026, short-term ones from June 2026, and long-term contracts by January 2028. Although Hungary and Slovakia opposed the move due to energy security concerns, the proposal passed with a weighted majority. The EU is also negotiating a package of sanctions that would ban Russian LNG imports from January 2027, one year earlier than originally planned. The initiative is seen as a crucial step toward energy independence, with support from key EU leaders and international pressure, including from U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized Europe for allegedly 'funding the war against itself'.",
