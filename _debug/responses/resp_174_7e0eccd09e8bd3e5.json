    "There is growing call for political action, including government-mandated data resilience standards requiring use of multiple cloud providers and continuous data replication to reduce systemic risk.",
    "The dominance of US cloud providers is seen as economically efficient due to economies of scale, but also raises geopolitical risks in times of conflict or government intervention.",
    "UK and European experts, including Nicky Stewart and Stephen Kelly, argue that diversifying cloud providers and building a sovereign, competitive, and interoperable cloud market is essential for national resilience and innovation."

With AWS and Microsoft dominating the UK cloud market at 30–40% each, even services not directly hosted on their platforms face 'nested dependency' risks due to shared underlying infrastructure. Experts warn that the assumption of resilience in major tech firms is flawed, and that market concentration poses systemic economic and geopolitical risks. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised alarms over unfair competition, recommending strategic market status for AWS and Microsoft to enforce diversification. Experts and policymakers now advocate for political action, including mandatory use of multiple cloud providers and data replication standards, to build national digital resilience and support innovation from UK-based and European providers.",
