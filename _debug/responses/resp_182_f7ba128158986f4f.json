  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Belize has entered into a bilateral agreement with the United States to serve as a 'safe third country' for migrants deported from the U.S., allowing them to apply for asylum instead of returning to their home countries. The deal, which requires Senate approval, includes strict safeguards such as nationality eligibility limits, background checks, and Belize’s authority to approve or reject transfers. Prime Minister John Antonio Briceño describes it as a targeted labor program for skilled Central Americans, not open immigration. The agreement aligns with a broader U.S. strategy under President Donald Trump to deport migrants to third countries, following Supreme Court rulings that allow such deportations without asylum hearings. Similar deals have been made with Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras. Critics, including Belize's opposition leader Tracy Taegar Panton and international human rights groups, raise serious concerns about national sovereignty, financial costs, and the risk of migrants facing violence or abuse in destination countries.",
