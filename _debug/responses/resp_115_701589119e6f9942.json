  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify their nest architecture in response to infection by the deadly fungus Metarhizium brunneum. Infected ants self-isolate and healthy ants—especially nurses—distance themselves from foragers, showing a form of proactive social distancing. Using CT scans, researchers observed that infected colonies build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and spaced entrances, which reduces disease transmission. This combination of social and structural behaviors represents a form of 'architectural immunity' that is the first documented in non-human social species. Experts like Sarah Kocher suggest that these natural strategies could inspire the design of public spaces to reduce disease spread, offering a novel, nature-based model for human health and urban planning.",
