    "Scientists have long been puzzled by a mysterious, diffuse gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008.",
    "The glow has been attributed to two main theories: pulsars (rotating remnants of dead stars) and dark matter collisions, particularly involving WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).",
    "Traditional models assumed dark matter was spherically distributed, but new supercomputer simulations show it could be squashed into an egg-shaped structure, matching the observed bulge-like shape of the glow.",
    "This new simulation suggests a 50% chance that the glow is due to dark matter, challenging the long-held dominance of the pulsar theory.",
    "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate by 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively confirm or rule out the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter, the results reinforce the plausibility of WIMPs as a candidate and support continued global efforts to detect them via particle experiments like LZ."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has long been debated as a possible sign of dark matter or pulsars. While traditional models assumed dark matter was spherically distributed, new supercomputer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues show that dark matter could be squashed into an egg-shaped structure at the galactic center — matching the observed bulge-like glow. This increases the likelihood that the glow could originate from dark matter, particularly WIMPs, which annihilate and produce detectable gamma rays. Although not definitive, the findings support the dark matter theory and suggest a 50% chance it is correct. A new observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to operate in 2027, will provide high-resolution gamma-ray data to confirm or refute the link. This work reignites hope in the decades-long search for dark matter and reinforces the central role of WIMPs in scientific models.",
