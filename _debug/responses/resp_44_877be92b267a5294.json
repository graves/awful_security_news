  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered in Mexico and operated by Duncan Aviation, crashed near Lansing, Michigan, during a post-maintenance test flight on October 17, 2025. The plane, which had not flown since March 25, 2025, descended rapidly—reaching 24,000 feet per minute—before plunging into woods. Pilots reportedly requested stall recovery, and air traffic control attempted contact seven times without success. The crash killed all three people on board, including two pilots and a maintenance representative. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation, noting the incident mirrors a 2024 crash involving a similar Hawker jet, which also occurred during a stall test flight. This recurrence raises serious concerns about the reliability of stall warning systems and maintenance practices in business aviation.",
