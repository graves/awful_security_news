  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Donald Trump has withdrawn from plans for a face-to-face summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine, citing the lack of progress on a ceasefire at the current front line. The US and Ukraine support freezing hostilities along the existing battle line, while Russia insists on full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbas and demands for recognition of Russian sovereignty over the region. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was canceled after a 'productive' call, signaling a shift in diplomatic strategy. Reports suggest tensions rose during a phone call between Trump and Putin, with speculation that Trump pressured Ukraine to give up parts of Donbas — a move Zelensky rejected. Russia's engagement in talks appears tied to concerns over the US deploying long-range Tomahawk missiles, which may have prompted a response. European leaders and Zelensky emphasize that the front-line freeze is the essential first step in diplomacy, and that Russia is avoiding genuine negotiations, framing the current impasse as a failure of trust and strategic alignment.",
