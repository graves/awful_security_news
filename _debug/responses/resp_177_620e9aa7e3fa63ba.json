  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest has been shelved, with the White House stating there are no plans for such a summit in the immediate future. This follows a failed preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which was deemed unnecessary after a 'productive' call. Central to the breakdown of talks are stark disagreements over the war in Ukraine: Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky advocated for a ceasefire at the current battle line in Donbas, while Russia demanded complete Ukrainian troop withdrawal and recognition of Russian sovereignty over the region. Russia has consistently rejected the idea of a frozen front line, calling it temporary and insufficient for sustainable peace. The only topic that prompted Russian engagement was the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, suggesting that military posturing has become a key diplomatic lever. Given the lack of progress and the failure of previous summits, such as the one in Alaska in August, the White House may have opted to avoid further high-risk diplomatic encounters.",
