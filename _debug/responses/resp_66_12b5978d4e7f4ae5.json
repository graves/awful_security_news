The law, which was announced on April 1, 2023, follows a period of public consultation and expert review that began in January 2023. It is designed to ensure that technology companies, especially those handling sensitive personal information, adhere to strict data protection standards. The legislation establishes a National Data Protection Authority (NDPA) to oversee compliance, investigate violations, and ensure transparency in data practices. Key provisions include mandatory data minimization, user consent protocols, and clear penalties for non-compliance. The law is inspired by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and aims to align national policies with international best practices. It also emphasizes the balance between individual privacy rights and the operational needs of technology businesses. Public debate on the law intensified during the second quarter of 2023, with stakeholders from the technology sector, consumer advocacy groups, and government agencies engaging in discussions. The law's implementation is set to begin on April 15, 2023, with a phased approach to ensure smooth adoption by businesses.","tags":["Data Protection","Privacy Law","Cybersecurity","Technology Regulation","Consumer Rights","Government Policy"],"timeOfPublication":"10:30:00+08:00","title":"New National Data Protection Law Enacted to Strengthen Privacy Rights"}
