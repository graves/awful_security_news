  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday, beginning at 07:11 GMT in its Virginia data center, disrupted over 113 AWS services, including financial apps, social media platforms, communication tools, gaming services, media organizations, and smart home devices. The root cause was a technical update to DynamoDB’s API that caused a DNS failure, preventing apps from finding server addresses and leading to a cascading failure. Despite AWS resolving the issue by 10:11 GMT, users faced processing backlogs, and platforms like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, and major news outlets reported outages. Experts confirmed the incident was due to human error, not a cyberattack, and emphasized that while such outages are not rare, their scale reflects the deep integration of cloud infrastructure into modern digital life. AWS's dominance in the cloud market (30%) amplifies the global impact of such events.",
