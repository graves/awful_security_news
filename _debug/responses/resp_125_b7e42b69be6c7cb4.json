  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of stalling diplomatic efforts to end the invasion of Ukraine, warning that any peace agreement involving territorial concessions would be unacceptable. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s shifting positions—initially supporting Ukraine’s recovery of lost territory, then suggesting the division of the Donbas region—European and Ukrainian officials remain resolute in their opposition to such proposals. They emphasize that borders must not be changed by force and reaffirm support for using Russia’s frozen assets abroad to financially aid Ukraine. A potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest is expected, though no date has been set, and the Kremlin has stated preparation is needed. The article highlights a tense diplomatic landscape, with international sanctions and coordination among the Coalition of the Willing reinforcing global support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and resistance to Russian territorial demands.",
