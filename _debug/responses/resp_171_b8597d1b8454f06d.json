  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing wave of AI-powered voice scams has targeted prominent Italian businessmen, including Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scam, which occurred in February 2025, was only uncovered when Crosetto himself received a suspicious call and reported it to the police. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants rating them as more trustworthy. Global losses from such deepfakes have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025, and AI-generated content, including child sexual abuse material, has become a major global concern. In response, the United States and Australia have introduced legislative measures to criminalize the publication of AI-generated intimate images, while technology companies like Resemble AI and DeepMedia are monitoring and attempting to detect synthetic media. Despite the risks, AI voice technology also offers valuable applications, such as helping individuals who have lost their ability to speak.",
