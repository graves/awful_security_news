  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prabowo Subianto's first year as Indonesia's president has faced significant challenges, including public protests over rising costs of living, corruption, and inequality, as well as a major scandal involving a free school meals programme that has led to over 9,000 children falling ill from food poisoning. Despite promising 8% annual economic growth by 2029, critics question whether his policies—particularly the costly and poorly implemented school meal initiative—are effective or sustainable, especially given Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure for safe food delivery across thousands of islands. The programme, which costs $28 billion annually, is criticized for poor oversight, contractor dependency, and lack of food safety standards. At the same time, Indonesia faces external pressures such as 19% US tariffs on exports and competition from Vietnam and Malaysia, which have successfully attracted manufacturing. Domestic issues include falling foreign investment, shrinking manufacturing, and a lack of skilled labor for emerging digital industries. While officials like Airlangga Hartarto defend policies and point to new initiatives like the Danantara sovereign wealth fund, experts warn that economic data may be politicized and that public trust is eroding. The article highlights Indonesia’s broader economic strain amid global headwinds and internal mismanagement, making it a critical moment for political stability and policy reform.",
