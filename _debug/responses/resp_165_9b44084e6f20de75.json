  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III and son of Queen Elizabeth II, has formally announced that he will relinquish all royal titles, including Duke of York and Knight of the Garter, effective immediately. This decision comes days before the release of Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which alleges that Andrew sexually abused her when she was a minor, trafficked by Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The allegations, first brought to public attention in 2021, were settled out of court in 2022 for $16 million, sparking public outcry over taxpayer funding. Andrew's long-standing ties to Jeffrey Epstein—including flights on Epstein’s private jet and private meetings—have been further exposed by newly released documents, including a 2019 email showing he told Epstein they were 'in this together'. Despite denying the claims, Andrew has now stepped away from public life, and his family has welcomed the title removal as 'vindication' for Giuffre and survivors. The broader implications include growing scrutiny of the British royal family’s accountability, especially regarding its handling of titles and public figures linked to sex trafficking and national security risks.",
