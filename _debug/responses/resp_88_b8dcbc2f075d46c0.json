The broader trend shows increasing support among Democrats for socialist ideas, with a Gallup poll indicating 66% of Democrats view socialism positively. Other progressive candidates, such as Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson, are now using DSA-inspired strategies, reflecting a growing demand for bold, activist-driven politics. The article highlights a fundamental realignment in American politics: voters are demanding more from their representatives, pushing the Democratic Party to move beyond centrist moderation and embrace a more progressive, working-class agenda.",
