  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has lifted a 38-plane-per-month production cap on Boeing's 737 MAX, allowing the company to increase output to 42 planes per month. This decision, made in October 2025, follows a 2024 safety incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that was missing four critical bolts, which led to the original production restriction. The FAA conducted extensive safety reviews to ensure that the increased production would not compromise safety or quality. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg was personally contacted by FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford to confirm the change, and the company now plans to immediately begin producing at the new rate. This milestone marks a significant step in Boeing’s recovery from the 2024 safety crisis and reflects renewed confidence in its manufacturing and regulatory oversight.",
