Senate Majority Leader John Thune has declared that Ingrassia's nomination will not pass, and at least one Republican senator, Rick Scott, has publicly opposed the nomination. Other GOP senators, including Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and James Lankford, have expressed hesitation or stated they will wait to see Ingrassia in person during his confirmation hearing. Ingrassia's ties to White nationalist Nick Fuentes and his history of promoting conspiracy theories and anti-Israel rhetoric further fuel concerns about his suitability for a federal whistleblower protection office. His legal team has disputed the authenticity of the texts, claiming they are satirical or manipulated. As a result, the nomination appears likely to be blocked, and the White House may decide to withdraw it.",
