  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a global call to action to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack such systems—particularly in developing nations. With over 2 million deaths attributed to weather, water, and climate hazards in the past 50 years, and 90% of those deaths occurring in developing countries, the WMO warns that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in nations without early warnings. Despite progress in early-warning adoption (from 52 to 108 countries in the last decade), assessments show half of 62 assessed countries still have only basic capacity. The article emphasizes that extreme weather is spiraling due to climate change, citing real-world examples such as the 2025 glacier collapse in Switzerland that allowed evacuation of Blatten, and major weather disasters in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and southern Europe. The WMO stresses that early warning systems are not just about alerting but empowering communities to take early action, with growing progress especially in Africa.",
