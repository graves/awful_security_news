  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The remains of 23-year-old Kada Scott, a woman who had been missing for about two weeks, were found in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia.

Keon King, 21, of Dover, Delaware, was arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, arson, conspiracy, and other related offenses. Evidence including cellphone location data and video footage of a stolen black Hyundai Accent parked near the site supports King’s involvement. Prosecutors believe he may have used the vehicle to transport Scott and that further charges, including homicide, are being considered. Authorities also indicate that others may have been involved after the fact, and investigations are ongoing. The case underscores the importance of community tips, digital evidence, and thorough forensic investigation in solving missing persons cases.",
