  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenny Loggins has objected to the use of his song 'Danger Zone,' from the 'Top Gun' soundtrack, in an AI-generated video on President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, depicting Trump dumping excrement from a fighter jet during 'No Kings' protests. Loggins, who was not consulted, criticized the video as divisive and inappropriate, calling for unity among Americans. The video, which remains online, follows a pattern of Trump using AI-generated content and copyrighted music in political posts, including earlier use of Blue Oyster Cult’s 'Don’t Fear the Reaper' in a post about Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. Other musicians, such as Adele and Bruce Springsteen, have similarly objected to Trump’s political use of music. The 'No Kings' protests, which denounced Trump’s authoritarian policies, saw widespread participation, and Trump dismissed them as a 'joke,' underscoring the tension between political expression and public sentiment.",
