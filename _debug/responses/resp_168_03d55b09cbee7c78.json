  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food supplies to Gaza remain critically low at around 750 tonnes—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two Israeli-controlled border crossings being open. While aid has increased since the US-brokered ceasefire, access remains severely restricted, with humanitarian agencies like WFP unable to use key routes such as Salah al-Din Street or the Rafah crossing, which remains closed. The WFP emphasizes that opening all crossings is essential to sustain the ceasefire and prevent famine, particularly in northern Gaza. Hamas has confirmed the handover of 13 of 28 pledged captives’ bodies, a condition tied to the reopening of aid routes, while many Palestinians are rationing and storing food due to ongoing uncertainty about the ceasefire’s duration.",
