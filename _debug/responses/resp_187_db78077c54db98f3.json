  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew's ability to live in the 30-room Royal Lodge, a Grade II-listed property on the Windsor estate, is explained by a 2003 lease agreement with the Crown Estate that required large upfront payments totaling around £8 million, effectively eliminating future rent obligations. The payments covered renovations and included a £5 million repair cost and a £2.5 million premium, with final costs exceeding initial estimates. Despite not paying annual rent, Prince Andrew is still responsible for maintaining the property, including painting, landscaping, and structural upkeep. The lease, set to end in 2078, allows his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie to continue residing there after his departure. The arrangement has come under public and political scrutiny due to Prince Andrew’s controversial links with Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous allegations of abuse, sparking debate over whether royals should live in taxpayer-funded properties without contributing financially. Critics, including the Chancellor and members of Parliament, argue that the arrangement is a misuse of public funds and call for Prince Andrew to pay his fair share or move out of royal property.",
