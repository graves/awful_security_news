The construction, which includes clearing trees and demolishing façades and windows, is set to be completed by January 2029. While the White House claims offices will be temporarily relocated and the main structure preserved, critics highlight procedural violations, lack of oversight, and potential disruption to the first lady's office. Carrier Global Corp. has donated HVAC systems, and Trump asserts the project is privately funded with no cost to taxpayers, though the donor list remains undisclosed.",
