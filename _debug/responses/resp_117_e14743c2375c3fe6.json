    "The Trump administration has made it harder for immigrants to become U.S. citizens by increasing the number of correct answers required on the civics test from 6 out of 10 to 12 out of 20.",
    "The list of possible questions has expanded from 100 to 128, with more difficult questions replacing easier ones such as those about geography (e.g., 'What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?') with complex historical and political questions (e.g., 'Why did the United States enter the Persian Gulf War?').",
    "Applicants must now demonstrate 'good moral character' by providing evidence of positive contributions to American society, and immigration officers may conduct more rigorous background checks, including interviews with coworkers, family members, or neighbors.",
    "USCIS officials argue the changes ensure 'full assimilation' and uphold the integrity of the naturalization process, claiming the current test is 'too easy' and fails to assess true commitment to American values.",
    "Critics, including immigration law professor Amanda Frost, argue there is no evidence that current naturalization practices allow individuals who don't share core American values to become citizens, and that immigrants and their descendants have historically contributed positively to U.S. society and economic growth.",
    "Advocates such as Julie Mitchell of the Central American Resource Center express concern that the changes may disproportionately impact individuals with low literacy levels and limited access to preparation materials, potentially reducing naturalization rates and increasing uncertainty in the process."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, including a harder civics test for immigrants applying for citizenship after October 20, 2025. The test will require applicants to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly—double the previous requirement—and will feature a longer list of 128 possible questions, including more difficult historical and political inquiries like the reasons for U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf and Vietnam Wars. Simultaneously, applicants must now prove 'good moral character' by providing evidence of positive contributions to society, and immigration officers may interview coworkers, family, or neighbors. While USCIS claims these changes ensure 'full assimilation' and uphold national values, critics—including legal experts and advocacy groups—argue there is no evidence that the current process allows individuals who don't share American values to become citizens, and that the changes may disproportionately affect low-literacy individuals and those without access to preparation materials, potentially reducing naturalization rates and increasing the process’s uncertainty.",
