The books, covering topics like LGBTQ pride, racism, and Critical Race Theory, were taken out under executive orders from former President Donald Trump and guidance from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, which banned discussions of gender ideology, DEI, and identity-based celebrations. Students from these schools claimed they were punished for protesting, becoming afraid to discuss race and gender in class. The ACLU filed suit, arguing the removals were politically motivated, not pedagogically sound. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles found that the actions were driven by improper partisan interests and ordered the immediate return of all removed books and curricular materials.",
