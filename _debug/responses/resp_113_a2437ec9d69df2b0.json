  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the midst of a federal government shutdown and deep political polarization, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the U.S., including New York, participated in an annual lobbying event organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Despite differing political affiliations—such as Mary Catherine Johnson, a Trump voter, and Lexy Mealing, a Democrat—volunteers united around their shared personal experience with cancer. They lobbied members of Congress for increased funding for cancer research, expanded access to screening, and continued support for insurance subsidies. While some lawmakers opposed subsidies, bipartisan support was found for research and screening. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, honoring 10,000 individuals affected by cancer. Personal stories and emotional resonance overrode political differences, demonstrating that shared human experiences can foster unity and civic engagement in a divided nation.",
