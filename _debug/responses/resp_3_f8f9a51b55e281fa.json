    "The Trump administration's proposed work rules for Medicaid enrollees — requiring at least 80 hours per month of work, study, job training, or volunteering — may disqualify millions, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034, mostly due to these rules.",

    "The technology being tested does not use artificial intelligence to infer activity levels; it only verifies income via payroll provider connections, limiting its usefulness in confirming work, study, or volunteer hours.",

    "A $200 million federal budget has been allocated to help states develop compliance systems, but this is roughly four times the cost of Georgia’s existing Medicaid work requirement program, which has struggled with enrollment and oversight.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration’s proposed work requirements for Medicaid enrollees — mandating 80 hours per month of work, study, or volunteering — are facing widespread skepticism due to ineffective pilot programs in Louisiana and Arizona. In Louisiana, only 7% of texted enrollees completed income verification, and Arizona’s pilot verified eligibility only for SNAP, not Medicaid. The technology being tested relies on payroll provider connections to verify income, not on AI to track work, study, or volunteer hours. Experts and state officials warn that without better tools, public awareness, and reliable access to technology, millions of eligible individuals—especially in rural or low-income areas—risk losing Medicaid coverage. The federal government has allocated $200 million for state implementation, but the tools are still under development, and no solution has been proven to work across diverse populations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these rules will result in 10 million fewer Americans having health coverage by 2034, making this a major public health and equity issue.",
