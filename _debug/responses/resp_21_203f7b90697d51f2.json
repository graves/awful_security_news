  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's plans for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have collapsed, with the White House confirming no immediate plans for a meeting. This follows a previous statement that a summit would occur within two weeks, which has now been abandoned due to a lack of progress in diplomatic dialogue. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a productive but inconclusive phone call, with officials noting that Lavrov lacks real influence and does not represent shifts in Russian policy. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date has been set and thus cannot be postponed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests that Russia's reduced interest in diplomacy stems from the U.S. withholding long-range missiles for Ukraine, implying that such capabilities are essential for peace. While Trump continues to advocate for a ceasefire and diplomatic resolution, the administration now views high-level meetings between aides as sufficient to assess positions, without needing a formal Trump-Putin summit. Future discussions may take place at the ASEAN summit in Malaysia.",
