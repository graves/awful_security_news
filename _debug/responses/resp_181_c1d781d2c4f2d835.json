  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump is being discussed, with Budapest proposed as a venue. However, Putin's 'Flying Kremlin' aircraft is banned from EU airspace, requiring individual permission from member states like Bulgaria or Romania to fly over their territory. Hungary, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is seen as a favorable location due to its strong ties with both Putin and Trump, and has confirmed it will ensure safe access for the leader. Despite the EU's support for peace efforts and its position on Ukraine, it will not participate in the talks, with Orban asserting that the EU is 'pro-war'. The main logistical challenges include navigating political sensitivities, avoiding Poland, and securing transit routes through countries like Serbia or via Turkey. The summit remains uncertain, but the political dynamics—especially Hungary’s strategic alignment with both Putin and Trump—make it a significant development in current international relations.",
