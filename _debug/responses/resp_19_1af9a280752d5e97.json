  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from a fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza — which secured the release of 20 living hostages and prompted international scrutiny over Hamas’s failure to return deceased hostage remains — to push forward with high-stakes diplomatic initiatives. He is prioritizing negotiations with Vladimir Putin in Budapest and with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to end the war in Ukraine and resolve trade tensions. Despite his confidence in peace outcomes, Trump faces skepticism from European allies and analysts about his ability to influence Russia or China, given their strategic autonomy. Meanwhile, Trump’s outreach to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been met with cautious optimism, as he has declined to deliver long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing concerns about escalation and battlefield realities. The Gaza deal's success is seen as a model of momentum-driven diplomacy, but its fragility underscores the challenges of sustaining peace in complex conflicts where political leverage and logistics are uneven.",
