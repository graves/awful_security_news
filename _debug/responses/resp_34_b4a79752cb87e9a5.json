The flight, Flight 6469, departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 PM and turned around just 18 minutes later. Passengers, including Henry Gruver and his family, reported feeling anxious as the plane banked and the flight attendants were banging on the cockpit door. The FAA and SkyWest later confirmed a malfunction in the flight crew interphone system, which prevented communication between the pilots and attendants. The plane eventually took off again five hours late, causing the Gruver family to miss their connection to Japan and wait overnight at the airport. Passengers were not informed of the issue until police boarded after landing.",
