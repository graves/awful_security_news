Flooding affected multiple areas, including Samar and Panay islands, where thousands evacuated to shelters and one person was injured in a house collapse. A major landslide in Bukidnon, Mindanao, blocked a highway and left two people missing. Emergency measures such as dam releases and flight cancellations were implemented. The storm occurred amid recovery from a recent earthquake series, and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the urgent need to strengthen disaster preparedness as the country remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, a trend scientists link to climate change.",
