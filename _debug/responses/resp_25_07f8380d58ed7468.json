  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deadly crash on the Glória funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2025, resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation. Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet both certification standards set by the operator CARRIS and internal specifications. Additionally, maintenance records show falsified entries, with tasks marked as completed even when not performed. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the descent as chaotic and uncontrolled. While the interim report identifies serious safety failures, it is noted to be preliminary, and a final report is expected in 2026.",
