  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies for allegedly violating her orders restricting the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests. The judge initially issued a sweeping order requiring body-worn cameras and warning demonstrators before deploying crowd control tactics, but reports of tear gas use without warning have raised concerns. Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration-led campaign that resulted in over 1,000 arrests in Illinois, intensified public protests at the Broadview ICE facility, where more than 15 arrests were made in a single weekend. Federal officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, claiming compliance with the judge’s directives, though the judge expressed significant concern that her orders are not being followed. Russell Hott, the former ICE field office head in Chicago, left the city and is now scheduled to be deposed. The judge has emphasized her need for clear, accountable testimony and will continue to pursue answers until she is satisfied that her order is being properly implemented.",
