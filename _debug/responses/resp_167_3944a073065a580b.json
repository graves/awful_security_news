Despite a 2022 financial settlement, Prince Andrew has voluntarily relinquished his titles and Order of the Garter, seen as a symbolic gesture. Senior political figures including Peter Kyle and Robert Jenrick have urged him to speak to U.S. authorities and potentially leave public life, emphasizing that victims must be at the center of justice efforts. The memoir also exposes a broader network of powerful individuals exploiting young women, with Ghislaine Maxwell serving a 20-year sentence for trafficking.
