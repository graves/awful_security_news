  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, Illinois, in response to protests against ICE agents, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that the protests constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president has broad, deferential authority under the 1827 precedent of Martin v. Mott to deploy federal military forces. However, federal judges, including April Perry and the 7th Circuit, have blocked the deployment, arguing that protests are not equivalent to riots and that state and local law enforcement are adequate. The case raises significant questions about the limits of presidential power in domestic matters, particularly in distinguishing between peaceful protest and violent resistance, and could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the U.S.",
