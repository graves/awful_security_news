  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Doubts are growing over a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest aimed at achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine. The Kremlin has downplayed expectations of an imminent meeting, citing no precise timeframe and the need for extensive preparation. Reports indicate a planned preparatory meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US counterpart Marco Rubio has been canceled, reflecting possible divergent views on ceasefire conditions. Russia maintains its hardline demands—such as territorial concessions and Ukraine’s neutrality—unchanged since the Alaska summit, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders accuse Moscow of stalling and continuing military aggression. Trump’s call for a frozen battle line has drawn support from Ukraine and allies, but has been rejected by Putin. Russia has also ruled out direct talks with Zelenskyy until a peace deal is practically agreed upon, deepening the diplomatic impasse.",
