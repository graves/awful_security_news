  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is challenging federal charges of lying and obstructing a congressional proceeding by arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump, citing a pattern of public attacks and personal animus. His legal team claims the appointment of White House adviser Lindsey Halligan as interim US Attorney violated constitutional procedures, as she was appointed after the 120-day limit for interim service had expired, thereby circumventing Senate confirmation. The defense draws precedent from the dismissal of Trump’s own indictment in Florida, where a similar unlawful appointment was found unconstitutional. Comey’s attorneys argue that such actions constitute an abuse of power and violate the First Amendment, and seek dismissal of the charges based on both vindictive prosecution and procedural illegitimacy.",
