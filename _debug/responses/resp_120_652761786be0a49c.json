  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has suggested that Ukraine should surrender the Donbas region to Russia in exchange for an end to the war, proposing that the conflict be settled by 'stopping at the battle line' and cutting up the region. This comes after Ukrainian drones struck the Orenburg gas processing plant, a major facility operated by Gazprom and feeding gas from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak field, temporarily disrupting supply. The attack prompted retaliatory drone strikes by Russia, including one on a coal mine in Dnipropetrovsk and an alleged strike on a Russian oil refinery in Novokuibyshevsk. Both sides reported drone exchanges, with Russia claiming to have shot down 45 Ukrainian drones and Ukraine reporting 62 drones launched into Russian territory. Trump’s comments mark a significant shift in U.S. policy, abandoning earlier support for Ukraine’s territorial recovery and instead advocating for territorial concessions, which contradicts Kyiv’s goals. At the same time, Ukraine claims that Russian forces are modifying bombs to strike deeper into Ukrainian territory, increasing the civilian impact of attacks.",
