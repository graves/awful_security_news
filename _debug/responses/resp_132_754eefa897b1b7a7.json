  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study showed that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that this public health strategy has made a measurable impact. Since the 2015 LEAP trial and subsequent guidelines, peanut allergy rates in U.S. children aged 0 to 3 have declined by over 27% and over 40% after 2017. Data from electronic health records show that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015, with early allergen introduction now widely supported by medical experts and advocacy groups. Despite initial slow adoption—only 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists followed the updated guidelines—current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other bodies advocate for introducing peanuts and other allergens between 4 and 6 months of age without screening. Experts like Dr. David Hill and Dr. Gideon Lack emphasize that small, safe exposures to peanut products are effective and supported by science, helping to reduce the prevalence of a dangerous, life-threatening condition.",
