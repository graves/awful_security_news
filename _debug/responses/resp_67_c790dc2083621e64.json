  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging the credibility of Patrick Fitzgerald, James Comey’s lead defense attorney, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017 during his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Fitzgerald denies the claims, stating that the memos shared with him were unclassified at the time and that no classified material was disclosed. Prosecutors argue that the case raises a potential conflict of interest, as Fitzgerald may have been part of a leak chain, and the ethical principle that one cannot be both a witness and counsel in the same case is being invoked. Both sides present conflicting evidence, with the DOJ citing quarantined evidence and Fitzgerald relying on a Justice Department inspector general’s report to refute the allegations. The dispute is significant because it raises broader questions about the integrity of legal representation in high-profile political cases involving former officials.",
