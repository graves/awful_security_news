  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, including potentially giving up the strategically important Donbas region. Trump, who previously suggested Ukraine could regain all lost territory, now advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the 'realities' of the conflict and high casualties. Zelensky described the meeting as tense but constructive, emphasizing agreement on a ceasefire at the current front, and later endorsed this position. European officials noted the meeting was marked by friction and direct disagreement, with Trump criticizing Ukraine’s request for long-range missiles and expressing concern about escalating the conflict. A prior phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a territorial swap involving eastern Donbas and southern regions, though Trump later shifted to supporting a standstill at the current front. Trump denied asking Ukraine to surrender all of Donbas, asserting that the war should end at present battle lines due to devastation and loss of life. The meeting reflects a significant shift in Trump’s strategy, prioritizing rapid war-ending over Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and signals deepening tensions in U.S.-Ukrainian diplomacy.",
