  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as observing animal behavior, cloud formations, and using gunfire or fire signals—to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), despite government efforts to deploy early warning systems (EWS). These systems, including the $37 million GLOF-II project, have failed to gain trust due to technical malfunctions, lack of maintenance, and poor community engagement. Real-life accounts from shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain demonstrate that human-based early warnings, passed down through generations, have saved lives more effectively than malfunctioning technology. Pakistan’s rising temperatures, with a 1.3°C increase since the 1950s, have intensified glacial melt and flood risks. The government’s lack of transparency and accountability in EWS implementation has led to widespread public skepticism, with communities turning to traditional practices as a more reliable form of climate resilience.",
