    "Brett James, a Grammy-winning songwriter known for collaborations with Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, while attempting a visual approach to runway 7 in Franklin, North Carolina.",
    "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the plane entered a 'tightening spiral' during flight, which led to the crash; no mechanical issues were found in the aircraft.",
    "James had requested a visual approach to runway 7, which was approved by air traffic control, but failed to tune his radio to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), leading to loss of communication with controllers.",
    "The pilot announced his position at 6,800 feet and intended to perform a 360-degree turn, but the controller attempted to reiterate that the radio frequency had not been changed, and there were no further communications.",
    "The Cirrus SR22T aircraft flew over the runway and continued descending into a left turn before entering the spiral and crashing.",
    "James's work with major music artists, including co-writing 'Out Last Night' for Kenny Chesney and 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' for Carrie Underwood, made him a highly influential figure in country music."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the plane, a Cirrus SR22T, entered a 'tightening spiral' due to a loss of communication with air traffic control after James failed to tune to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), despite being instructed to do so. The incident occurred after James announced his position at 6,800 feet and planned a 360-degree turn, but the controller noted the radio frequency had not changed.
