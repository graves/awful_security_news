  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s efforts to quickly convene a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been abandoned, with the White House now stating there are no plans for such a meeting in the immediate future. This follows a previous pledge to meet within two weeks after a phone call, which appears to have failed due to a lack of progress or alignment in positions. A proposed meeting between U.S. Secretary Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was deemed productive but insufficient, as the Russian position remains maximalist and Lavrov is seen as a symbolic figure with limited influence. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky links Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest to the U.S. withholding long-range Tomahawk missiles, suggesting that military support is key to peace. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date was set, so it cannot be postponed. The administration continues to support peaceful resolution of the Ukraine war, though high-level engagement remains stalled, with future talks possibly occurring at regional events like ASEAN.",
