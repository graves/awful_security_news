Maduro responds with mass military mobilization, claiming over 8 million militia members and militarizing 20 out of 23 states under the 'Independence 200' campaign. The U.S. has justified these actions by labeling drug trafficking groups as enemy combatants, raising legal and ethical concerns, including the detention of two survivors from a recent strike. Internal dissent within the Pentagon and the retirement of SOUTHCOM Admiral Alvin Holsey signal growing unease over the legality and escalation of military actions. Meanwhile, Venezuelans express anxiety and fear of conflict, with public protests emerging in support of U.S. pressure on Maduro, while Maduro strengthens his domestic control through emergency decrees and repression of civil liberties.",
