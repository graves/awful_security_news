  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, 38, to a prison term of five years to life for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. Rossi, who has a history of sexual abuse and prior sex-related charges in Ohio, reportedly faked his death in 2020 and fled to Scotland, where he was arrested in 2021 due to distinctive tattoos linked to an Interpol notice. After being extradited to Utah in January 2024, he was convicted in both an August and September 2025 trial, with the judge describing him as a 'serial abuser' and 'flight risk.' The victim described the abuse as leaving a trail of fear, pain, and destruction and called for accountability and safety. Authorities identified Rossi through a decade-old DNA rape kit, and his use of aliases, including 'Arthur Knight,' indicates a long-standing pattern of evasion. The case underscores the challenges of clearing rape kit backlogs and the dangers posed by serial abusers who flee justice.",
