    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its harsh climate, has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting in the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The mosquito was discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected it at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The species Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere and is adapted to cold climates, allowing adult mosquitoes to survive in sheltered conditions during winter.",
    "This is the first confirmed record of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment, despite a prior single specimen being found on a plane at Keflavík International Airport years ago.",
    "Theories for how the mosquito arrived include ships or containers, though the exact origin remains unclear.",
    "Climate change may facilitate the spread of mosquitoes, but experts remain cautious about attributing the discovery directly to warming temperatures.",
    "Iceland has already experienced extreme heat due to climate change, such as record-breaking temperatures in May 2025, which were made 40 times more likely by climate change.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson suggest that while warming may increase the potential for mosquito establishment, it is not certain that climate change caused the discovery.",
    "Further monitoring in the spring is needed to determine whether the species can survive the winter and become established in Iceland."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland has confirmed its first wild mosquito sighting, with three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, on October 16, 2025. The discovery, made by resident Björn Hjaltason and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift, as mosquitoes were previously believed to be absent from Iceland due to its cold climate. The species is adapted to cold environments and can survive winter in sheltered conditions. While climate change may have contributed to warmer conditions enabling mosquito survival, experts like Colin J. Carlson caution that it is not certain the discovery is directly linked to global warming. A prior mosquito found on a plane at Keflavík International Airport years ago was not considered natural. Ongoing monitoring is needed to determine if the species can establish a permanent presence in Iceland, highlighting broader concerns about how climate change may expand the range of disease-carrying insects globally.",
