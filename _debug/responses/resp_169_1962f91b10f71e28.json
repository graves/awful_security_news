Satellite analysis by Forensic Architecture shows only Israeli tanks present, with no gunfire, contradicting official statements. The Hind Rajab Foundation alleges that the 401 Armoured Brigade, under Colonel Beni Aharon, and the 'Vampire Empire' unit under Major Sean Glass and Colonel Daniel Ella, directly carried out the killings and tampered with the crime scene. A soldier, Itay Choukirkov, is being sued under Argentinian law, and Shimon Zuckerman, a war influencer, is being prosecuted for footage showing genocidal operations. The incident has prompted broader concerns within Israeli security circles about international war crime prosecutions and their impact on military and intelligence agencies.",
