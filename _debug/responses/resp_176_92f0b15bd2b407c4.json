    "A life-changing eye implant, the Prima implant, has enabled blind patients with geographic atrophy to regain central vision and read again.",
    "The implant, developed by Science Corporation in California, works by using a microchip under the retina to convert video images from smart glasses into enhanced signals sent to the brain via the optic nerve.",
    "In a multinational trial involving 38 patients across five European countries, 27 out of 32 participants were able to read again, achieving a 25-letter improvement on an eye chart after one year.",
    "Sheila Irvine, a 70-year-old patient from Wiltshire, regained the ability to read books, crosswords, and street signs, which was previously impossible due to geographic atrophy.",
    "The technology is still not licensed for public use and remains only available in clinical trials, with uncertain long-term costs and scalability.",
    "Experts like Dr. Peter Bloomfield of the Macular Society see the results as 'encouraging' and a major breakthrough, especially for those with no prior treatment options for dry AMD.",
    "The implant is not suitable for conditions where the optic nerve is damaged or non-functional.",
    "Patients must maintain high concentration and stillness to use the device effectively, limiting outdoor use and requiring disciplined daily routines."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A groundbreaking eye implant, the Prima device developed by Science Corporation, has enabled blind patients with geographic atrophy—a severe form of dry age-related macular degeneration—to regain central vision and read again. In a multinational trial involving 38 patients across five European countries, 27 were able to read with significant improvement, including a 25-letter gain on an eye chart after one year. The implant, which uses a 2mm microchip under the retina and images from smart glasses, sends enhanced visual signals to the brain via the optic nerve. Patient Sheila Irvine, who lost vision over 30 years ago, now reads books, crosswords, and street signs, describing the experience as 'out of this world.' While the technology is still in clinical trials and not yet licensed for public use, experts believe it could eventually be available on the NHS, offering unprecedented hope for millions affected by dry AMD.",
