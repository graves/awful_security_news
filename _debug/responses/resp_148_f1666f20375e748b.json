  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a global call to action for strengthening early-warning systems against extreme weather events, emphasizing that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capacity. With over 2 million people dying from weather-related disasters in the past 50 years—90% in developing nations—climate change is intensifying risks. Despite progress in early-warning adoption, 50% of 62 assessed countries still have only basic systems. The WMO highlights that fragile and conflict-affected regions face the greatest vulnerability, while progress is seen in Africa. Real-world examples, such as the evacuation of Blatten, Switzerland, after a glacier collapse in May 2025, demonstrate the life-saving potential of early warnings. The organization stresses that early warnings are not just alerts but tools for empowering communities to take proactive action, especially as extreme weather events spiral due to climate change.",
