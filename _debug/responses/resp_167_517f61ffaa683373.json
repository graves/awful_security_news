  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-powered voice scams targeting wealthy Italian businessmen has emerged, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to clone the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request money for a fictional kidnapping of journalists. This incident, occurring shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni secured the release of journalist Cecilia Sala, highlights the growing sophistication of AI voice cloning, which can now produce voices indistinguishable from real human ones. Research from Queen Mary University of London confirms that AI-generated voice clones are rated as equally realistic as real voices and are even perceived as more trustworthy. Global losses from deepfake scams have reached over $547 million between January and June 2025, with rising misuse in fraudulent calls and non-consensual sexual content. The US and Australia have responded with new laws banning the distribution of AI-generated intimate images. While AI voice technology offers ethical benefits—such as helping individuals with speech impairments—the technology poses serious threats to personal identity, financial security, and public trust.",
