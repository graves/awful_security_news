  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tesla is set to report record sales of nearly 500,000 vehicles in its third quarter of 2025, driven by a surge in U.S. EV purchases before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit. However, analysts project that adjusted earnings will fall short of the $2.5 billion earned in the same period last year, reflecting major headwinds. The loss of the tax credit and the elimination of regulatory credit sales — a long-standing revenue source — threaten Tesla’s financial stability. Increased global competition, especially from Chinese automaker BYD, which is expected to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest EV seller, adds to the pressure. Tesla’s future growth is now increasingly tied to its self-driving technology and robotaxi program, which launched in late June. The company’s upcoming earnings call will also include discussions on Elon Musk’s controversial $1 trillion stock-based pay package, which will be voted on by shareholders at the annual meeting next month.",
