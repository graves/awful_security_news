  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the LEAP trial demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing food allergies, new research shows a significant real-world decline in peanut allergies in the U.S. Children aged 0 to 3 saw a 27% to 40% drop in allergy rates after 2015 and 2017 public health guidelines recommended early exposure. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records and found that approximately 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. The original LEAP trial by Gideon Lack showed that early allergen exposure reduced allergy risk by over 80%, with lasting effects into adolescence. Despite initial resistance from medical professionals, adoption of the guidelines has increased, and current recommendations encourage parents to introduce peanuts and other allergens between 4 and 6 months of age via small, safe exposures like peanut butter or yogurt. Advocacy groups like FARE support these practices as a vital step in reducing the prevalence of food allergies nationwide.",
