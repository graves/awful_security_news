The theft, completed in just seven minutes, has been valued at $102 million (88 million euros), with French authorities highlighting significant security vulnerabilities. The Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, has long warned of outdated infrastructure, and a report by the Court of Auditors reveals only a quarter of one wing has video surveillance. This incident follows a string of museum thefts, including at the Natural History Museum and a museum in Limoges, and has prompted political and public outcry over underfunding and staff cuts despite soaring visitor numbers. The Louvre, a global cultural landmark with over 8.7 million visitors annually, remains under investigation and is expected to reopen shortly.",
