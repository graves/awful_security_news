The removals were driven by executive orders from President Trump and guidance from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, which banned instruction on Critical Race Theory, DEI, and gender ideology. These policies led to the removal of nearly 600 books and the cancellation of cultural events like Black History Month and Holocaust Remembrance Day, while teachers were instructed to erase posters of activists and artists such as Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo. Students and their families, represented by the ACLU, argued that such actions violated their First Amendment rights and created a climate of fear in classrooms. Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles found that the actions were politically motivated and ordered the immediate return of all removed books and curricula.",
