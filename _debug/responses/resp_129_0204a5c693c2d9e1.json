  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in over two decades, won a decisive 54.5% in the presidential runoff, ending more than a decade of leftist rule under the MAS party. His victory marks a significant shift in Bolivia’s foreign policy, with a clear pivot toward the United States, where U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the change as a transformative opportunity for cooperation on investment, security, and immigration. Paz rejected an IMF bailout, emphasizing resistance to neoliberal policies, and has begun negotiations with the Trump administration to secure vital fuel imports to address severe shortages and inflation. The new government faces a fragile economic situation, including a depleted U.S. dollar reserve and profligate spending. Paz’s campaign was energized by Edman Lara, a former police captain turned social media figure, whose populist messaging resonated with rural and working-class voters. Despite this, Paz is warned by former President Evo Morales that gaining political support from MAS supporters comes with a mandate to avoid neoliberalism, repression, and anti-protest measures. The government plans to target subsidies to poor families through direct cash transfers while maintaining fuel prices for transport workers. A key challenge lies in reforming the judiciary, which has long been seen as politically biased, risking alienation of Bolivia’s Indigenous majority. Protests erupted after the election due to concerns over electoral fraud, echoing past unrest following Morales’ 2019 re-election. The inauguration on November 8, 2025, will mark the beginning of a new political era in Bolivia, with significant implications for regional politics and economic policy.",
