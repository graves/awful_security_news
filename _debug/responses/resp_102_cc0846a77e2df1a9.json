  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that reversing the long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infants has significantly reduced food allergies in the U.S. The shift, spurred by a landmark 2015 study (LEAP) that found early peanut exposure reduces allergy risk, led to updated guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Researchers analyzed health data from over 120,000 children and found a 43% drop in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergy rates over the past decade, preventing at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy. While experts like Dr. Corinne Keet caution about data limitations and incomplete guideline implementation, the results confirm a major public health benefit: peanut allergies, which are often lifelong, have been effectively reduced through early allergen introduction.",
