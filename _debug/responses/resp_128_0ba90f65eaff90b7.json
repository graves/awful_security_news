  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College, an incident that went unprosecuted for over a decade due to systemic failures in campus sexual assault cases. Keeler, who began pursuing charges immediately after the assault, was ultimately able to press forward after an Associated Press story in 2021 highlighted the reluctance of prosecutors to act. Cleary was tracked down in France in 2024 through an unrelated vagrancy arrest and extradited to Pennsylvania, where he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault in 2025. A judge sentenced him to two to four years in prison, citing his remorse, guilty plea, and history of mental illness, while noting that the case exposed deep flaws in how such crimes are handled, including lost forensic evidence and prolonged delays. The case underscores the emotional toll on survivors and the urgent need for reform in campus sexual assault response systems.",
