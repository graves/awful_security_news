  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia launched a coordinated and sophisticated attack on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 using 465 drones and 32 missiles, destroying a key power source and leaving the city without electricity and water for much of the day. This marks a strategic evolution in Russia’s campaign to cripple Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, targeting not only power stations but also natural gas delivery facilities. The attacks, made possible by modified drones and missiles that evade Western air defenses, have severely degraded Ukraine’s ability to provide heat and power during an expected harsh winter. Corrupt practices in the procurement of anti-drone systems have further undermined infrastructure resilience, with officials admitting that funds were misallocated toward ineffective measures. As a result, residents are forced to rely on personal power sources, gas-powered appliances, and emergency supplies, highlighting the growing threat to civilian survival. Experts warn that Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is now at risk of collapse, potentially leading to one of the most severe winters since the war began.",
