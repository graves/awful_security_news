  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and major quarterback changes. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Giants, with second-year QB Bo Nix delivering a heroic performance that included multiple touchdowns and a game-winning field goal. In another historic moment, New England Patriots' quarterback Drake Maye broke Tom Brady’s franchise completion record (88.5%) with a 91.3% completion rate in a 31-13 win over the Titans, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of passes, throw for over 200 yards, and rush for over 50 yards in a single game. Meanwhile, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets both suffered crushing losses, leading to the benching of Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields, respectively. The Packers also defeated the Cardinals in a tense game, with defensive star Micah Parsons stifling Arizona’s final drive. Overall, the season has become increasingly unpredictable, with 26 lead changes in the final two minutes of regulation — the most in NFL history — highlighting the growing volatility of outcomes in the league.",
