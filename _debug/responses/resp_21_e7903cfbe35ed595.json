  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and mental health providers across the U.S. are raising alarms about a policy shift within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system that limits long-term one-on-one therapy sessions for veterans, especially those with chronic conditions like PTSD. The policy, intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins since January 2025, mandates strict session caps (often between 4 and 24 visits), with providers facing disciplinary action if they extend care beyond those limits. Veterans like Michael, a combat veteran from Afghanistan, describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized when sessions are abruptly ended, even when they are not clinically ready to discontinue treatment. Providers report that such policies undermine patient-therapist trust, fail to account for individual mental health needs, and have led to staff resignations. While the VA maintains that there are no formal limits on appointments and that care is patient-centered, critics—including mental health professionals and the American Psychological Association—argue that the implementation is unclinical, inconsistent, and harmful. The broader debate centers on whether short-term, time-bound therapy is appropriate for all veterans, especially those with long-term mental health challenges, and whether the VA should prioritize system efficiency over individual recovery and trust-building.",
