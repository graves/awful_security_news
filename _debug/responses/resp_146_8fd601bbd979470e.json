  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, with forecasted strong winds and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The provincial government activated evacuation plans for coastal and landslide-prone areas, reflecting a recurring pattern in which Catanduanes is often among the first landmasses affected by western Pacific cyclones. This event occurs amid a broader context of increasing natural disasters in the Philippines, including recent earthquakes in Cebu and the southern region, and Typhoon Ragasa, which has already displaced thousands. Scientists warn that these storms are becoming more intense due to human-driven climate change, underscoring the growing vulnerability of the countryâ€™s impoverished, disaster-prone communities to extreme weather.",
