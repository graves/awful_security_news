  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a Slovak court convicted Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, of terrorism for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 during a public event in Handlova. Cintula fired five shots at Fico from within one meter, seriously injuring him. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that the attack was terrorism due to its targeted nature against a political leader, rejecting claims that it was merely an attack on a public official. Cintula, who claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture and stated the attack was a 'scream against fear', has vowed to appeal. The verdict highlights deep societal and political divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition parties for fueling anger and opposition accusing him of eroding democracy and media freedom. Despite the conviction, Fico has publicly forgiven Cintula, and the case remains a focal point in national debates over political violence, freedom of expression, and democratic stability.",
