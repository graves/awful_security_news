    "The WMO reports that weather, water, and climate hazards have caused over 2 million deaths globally in the last 50 years.",
    "While 108 countries now use multi-hazard early warning systems (up from 52 in the previous decade), half of the 62 assessed countries have only basic or less-than-basic capacity.",
    "The situation is most severe in fragile, conflict-affected regions, though progress is being made in Africa with more countries establishing functional websites and standardized alerts.",
    "Early warning systems enable early action and save lives; the WMO emphasizes that their mission is not just to warn, but to empower communities to respond effectively.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has issued a global call to action, urging the expansion of early-warning systems for extreme weather events as climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of disasters. Despite progress in monitoring over the past decade—such as the rise in countries using multi-hazard alerts from 52 to 108—nearly half of all nations still lack adequate systems, with 90% of weather-related deaths in the last 50 years occurring in developing countries. The WMO warns that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early warnings, and that climate-driven weather events such as floods in Pakistan, Nigeria, and South Korea, and wildfires in southern Europe and the US, are now affecting all regions. A critical case in Switzerland shows how monitoring a melting glacier in May 2025 allowed the evacuation of the village of Blatten, demonstrating the life-saving potential of early detection. The WMO emphasizes that early warning is not just about alerting people, but empowering them to act—highlighting the urgent need for global investment and coordination to plug monitoring gaps, especially in fragile and conflict-affected regions.",
