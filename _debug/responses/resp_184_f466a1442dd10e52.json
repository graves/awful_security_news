  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is beginning demolition of parts of its East Wing to construct a new $250 million ballroom, announced by President Donald Trump as part of a 'full modernization' project. Although Trump claims the new space will be 'near' but not touching the original structure and will respect its historical integrity, critics including the National Park Service, the Society of Architectural Historians, and the American Institute of Architects express deep concern over the lack of a rigorous design and review process. The East Wing, built in 1902 and last altered in 1942, is being gutted, with construction visible on-site, and the project is privately funded by unnamed 'Patriots'. Clark Construction is overseeing the work, with McCrery Architects designing the space, which may host up to 900 people and feature gold chandeliers. Critics argue that such a major alteration to a historically significant building—considered the 'People's House'—should follow decades-old preservation protocols, not be executed rapidly in a manner reflective of Trump’s personal style. This project continues a long tradition of presidential renovations, from Nixon’s pool-to-press room change to Truman’s complete rebuild, but raises new questions about historical preservation in the face of modern political ambitions.",
