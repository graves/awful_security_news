  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Palestine solidarity activist, was detained by U.S. immigration authorities after his activism at Columbia University drew government scrutiny. A federal district court in New Jersey granted him release on a habeas corpus petition, asserting that his detention violated constitutional rights. The government, however, continues to pursue deportation, citing foreign policy concerns and claiming Khalil concealed his work with UNRWA. Legal experts, including the ACLU, argue that using immigration law to punish political speech is unconstitutional. While Khalil’s release from detention is currently upheld, his deportation case is ongoing and being appealed through the immigration system, with significant constitutional and free speech implications. The case is seen as a pivotal moment in the broader debate over political activism, free speech, and the limits of immigration enforcement in the United States.",
