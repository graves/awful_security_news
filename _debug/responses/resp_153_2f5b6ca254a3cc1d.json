  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has started a five-year jail term at La Sante prison in Paris, becoming the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned. The sentence follows a conviction for criminal conspiracy involving illegal campaign donations from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2007, which Sarkozy has consistently denied. Despite his claims of innocence, the presiding judge, Nathalie Gavarino, deemed the offenses of 'exceptional gravity,' leading to a mandatory prison sentence. Sarkozy will be held in solitary confinement under strict conditions, with limited contact and one daily walk, and his legal team has filed an appeal for release, pending review in two months. The case has sparked public protests, with supporters expressing sorrow over the erosion of democratic integrity, and has drawn significant attention as a landmark moment in political accountability, especially given the historical rarity of such a sentence for a former head of state in France.",
