  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, known for his work with major music artists such as Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, and Kenny Chesney, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, when his Cirrus SR22T aircraft entered a 'tightening spiral' during a flight to runway 7 in Franklin, North Carolina. The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report found no mechanical failures, but identified a critical communication failure: James did not tune to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) despite being instructed to do so, and failed to respond to air traffic control after announcing a 360-degree turn at 6,800 feet. This incident raises concerns about pilot communication protocols and aviation safety in visual approaches, particularly in remote or low-traffic areas.",
