The U.S. has conducted multiple military strikes in the Caribbean targeting vessels linked to drug trafficking, resulting in fatalities and survivor returns. Petro responded with cultural critique, referencing Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez's novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' to highlight the lack of understanding between the U.S. and Colombia. The situation reflects a deepening diplomatic rift, with implications for regional stability, international aid, and military intervention in drug-related activities.",
