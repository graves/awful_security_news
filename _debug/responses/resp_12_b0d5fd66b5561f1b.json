  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer based in Astoria, Queens, exemplifies a viable model of U.S. manufacturing by relying on skilled craftsmanship, premium pricing, and domestic sourcing rather than mass production. Despite President Donald Trump’s trade policies aimed at reshoring manufacturing, which have created economic uncertainty and led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, Steinway thrives due to its focus on quality and innovation. The company's production process, which takes up to 11 months and involves only four or five pianos per day, requires a highly specialized workforce that cannot be easily replicated. Challenges such as the scarcity of Sitka spruce from Alaska and the difficulty of finding skilled artisans further emphasize the uniqueness and resilience of this model. The article ultimately suggests that traditional, artisanal manufacturing — exemplified by Steinway — may offer a more sustainable path forward in a world where automation and trade wars are disrupting conventional manufacturing models.",
