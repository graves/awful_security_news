    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a global cloud outage affecting over 2,500 companies and a broad range of services, including social media, gaming, financial platforms, and streaming services.",
    "The outage originated in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which converts web addresses into IP addresses, disrupting internet connectivity for users worldwide.",
    "DownDetector recorded over 11 million user reports, with users of Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, McDonald’s app, Netflix, Disney+, Coinbase, and Signal reporting issues.",
    "Amazon's own services, such as Ring doorbell cameras, Alexa smart speakers, and Kindle, were also impacted, showing that even internal platforms are vulnerable to infrastructure failures.",
    "The outage is not unprecedented — AWS has faced similar disruptions in 2017, 2020, and 2021, with the 2021 outage lasting over five hours and affecting a wide array of global businesses.",
    "Experts like cybersecurity professor Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess note that such outages are typically due to technical issues, not cyberattacks, and are usually resolved within hours.",
    "The incident underscores how modern society is dependent on a small number of cloud providers (like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft), meaning a single failure can have cascading effects across the internet.",
    "Users often do not see the root cause — they only experience disruptions in services like Snapchat or Roblox — making it difficult to identify the source of the problem."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in early October 2025 disrupted global internet services, including social media, gaming, finance, and streaming platforms. The failure originated in AWS’s domain name system (DNS) in the US-EAST-1 region and led to over 11 million user reports across more than 2,500 companies, affecting services like Snapchat, Roblox, Robinhood, Netflix, and Disney+. Even Amazon’s own products, such as Ring and Alexa, were impacted. Experts noted that the incident is consistent with past AWS outages and is likely due to a technical failure rather than a cyberattack. The event highlights the fragility of modern digital infrastructure, where the failure of a single cloud provider can cascade across the internet and leave users unable to access critical services, emphasizing the need for resilience and redundancy in global technology systems.",
