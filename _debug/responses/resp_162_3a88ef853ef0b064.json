  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a pivotal political shift, Bolivia has elected Rodrigo Paz of the centre-right Christian Democratic Party (PDC) as president, ending nearly two decades of governance by the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party. With 54.5% of the vote in the run-off election, Paz narrowly outpaced right-wing candidate Jorge Quiroga, who received 45.4%. The election follows a major defeat for MAS in August’s preliminary vote, triggered by Evo Morales’s disqualification due to term limits and the split within the left-wing coalition. Bolivia faces severe economic challenges, including nearly 25% inflation, fuel and food shortages, and declining energy revenues since Morales’s tenure ended. Paz, son of former president Jaime Zamora, has pledged a 'capitalism for all' agenda with tax cuts, tariff reductions, and decentralisation, though his position on fuel subsidies remains unclear. Despite the shift in power, opposition from Morales—especially among Indigenous communities—remains strong, underscoring the political volatility and deep social divisions in the country.",
