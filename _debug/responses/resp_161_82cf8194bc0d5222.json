  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the construction of a new $250 million ballroom in the White House’s East Wing, marking the first major structural change to the complex since 1948. The project, which began on October 21, 2025, involves the demolition of the existing East Wing — previously used by the First Lady and for diplomatic visits — and will include a 90,000-square-foot space capable of seating up to 999 guests. Despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission due to a government shutdown, the project has moved forward, with construction led by McCrery Architects, Clark Construction, and engineering support from AECOM. Trump claims the initiative is privately funded and will not affect the main White House building, though critics remain skeptical. The project is expected to be completed before Trump’s term ends in January 2029 and reflects a broader trend of presidential modernization and personalization of the White House, especially in response to demands for more space for state functions and diplomatic events.",
