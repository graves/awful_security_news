  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A professional criminal gang robbed the Apollo Gallery at the Louvre museum, stealing eight royal crown jewels from the 19th century, including items belonging to Napoleon’s wife Marie-Louise, his sister-in-law Hortense, Queen Marie-Amelie, and Empress Eugénie. The thieves used a disc-cutter and a truck with an elevating platform to gain entry, demonstrating premeditation and technical skill. One crown was recovered damaged, suggesting it was dropped during escape. The heist raises serious concerns about museum security in France, especially as recent thefts—including raw gold and porcelain—reveal a growing trend of targeting saleable, non-displayable items. Authorities have responded with increased security measures, noting that such crimes are driven by financial gain rather than ideological motives, and that the stolen items can be easily broken down and sold on the black market. The incident follows a long history of museum thefts in France, including the 1911 Mona Lisa disappearance and the 1998 disappearance of a painting by Camille Corot.",
