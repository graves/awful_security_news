  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis is closely examining the federal government’s response to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a major ICE enforcement operation that led to over 1,000 arrests. The judge expanded her temporary restraining order to require all on-the-ground federal agents to wear body-worn cameras during protests, citing concerns about the lack of warning before the use of tear gas and pepper balls. While CBP agents are required to use cameras, ICE’s Special Response Teams have not been issued them and would require congressional approval. ICE agents are trained in crowd control and handling journalists, but a pastor, Rev. David Black, reported being struck multiple times with pepper balls during a protest in Albany Park without prior warning. Federal leadership has been described as a 'revolving door,' with key officials like Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino being deposed to provide on-the-ground accountability. The Trump administration has denied reports of tear gas use without warning, asserting the judge relies on selective media. Internal review processes exist, but the lack of transparency and consistent camera use raises serious concerns about accountability and public safety.",
