  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In September 2025, over 500 cancer survivors—including Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin—participated in an annual citizen lobbying event organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in Washington, D.C. Amid a federal government shutdown and deep political polarization, the volunteers from across the U.S. transcended partisan differences, focusing instead on shared personal experiences with cancer. They advocated for increased cancer research funding, expanded access to screening, and continued federal health insurance subsidies. Despite political disagreements, no volunteer discussed party affiliation, as one volunteer noted, 'Cancer doesn't care.' The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall honoring 10,000 names of individuals affected by cancer. The experience highlighted bipartisan public support for cancer care, with polls showing that 70% of Americans—including both Democrats and Republicans—consider it vital to fund medical research. This collective action demonstrates how personal trauma can foster empathy, bridge political divides, and mobilize citizens around a shared cause.",
