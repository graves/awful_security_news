  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister on October 21, 2025, following a political vacuum after the Liberal Democratic Party's July election loss and the departure of its long-time coalition partner, Komeito. Takaichi, a protege of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, won 237 votes in the lower house, defeating opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda with 149 votes. Her government is formed through a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party, which has shifted Japan’s political direction toward conservatism and nationalism. Despite her historic role as the first woman in the role, Takaichi opposes gender equality, same-sex marriage, and supports male-only imperial succession. Her government faces significant instability due to lacking a parliamentary majority and must rely on alliances to pass legislation. Key policy priorities include addressing rising prices and economic challenges, and she has begun to tone down controversial actions like visiting Yasukuni Shrine. The appointment marks a turning point in Japanese politics, with implications for regional diplomacy, domestic policy, and global perceptions of Japan’s leadership.",
