  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims in October 2025 linking autism to circumcision, citing two studies and a non-peer-reviewed 2025 preprint from WPLab. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, clarify that neither the 2013 nor 2015 studies establish causation—both show only weak, statistically limited correlations and fail to account for confounding variables. The 2013 study treated circumcision as a proxy for acetaminophen use without data on drug administration, while the 2015 Danish study had extremely small sample sizes and excluded home circumcisions. WPLab’s 2025 preprint, which claims acetaminophen triggers autism, has not been peer-reviewed and misrepresents prior research. Decades of evidence show acetaminophen is safe for infants when used appropriately. The claims are widely dismissed by the scientific community, which emphasizes that correlation does not imply causation.",
