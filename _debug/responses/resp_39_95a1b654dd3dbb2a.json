  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was executed in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 18, 2025, for the 1993 murder of Albert Luna Sr., Patricia Luna, Rochelle Luna (18), and Damien Luna (5), which he committed in retaliation for a theft he blamed on a family member, Albert Luna Jr. The execution was the second in Arizona that year and the fourth in the U.S. this week, following years of pauses due to procedural issues and public criticism. Officials including Attorney General Kris Mayes and Deputy Director John Barcello emphasized that the victims’ families deserve justice and closure. The process, which took about 10 minutes and involved multiple IV attempts due to poor vein access, highlighted ongoing concerns about the state’s execution procedures, especially after a 2014 botched execution of Joseph Wood. The execution resumed in 2022 after a review paused in 2023, with Governor Katie Hobbs ending the review in November 2024. Djerf had previously apologized in a statement, and no family members were present. The execution increased Arizona’s death row population to 107, with five more executions scheduled across the U.S. in 2025.",
