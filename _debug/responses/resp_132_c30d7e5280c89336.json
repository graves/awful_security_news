The shutdown has left federal scientists unpaid and without funding for participation, and the administration’s broader actions — including layoffs, funding cuts, and restrictions on scientific collaboration — have severely weakened the CDC’s capacity to share critical public health research. Experts like Michael Osterholm are stepping in to continue vital work through new open-access publications and private-sector research coalitions. Critics argue that these actions are intentionally limiting the flow of scientific information, creating a dangerous gap in public health preparedness during active disease threats.",
