  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, triggered by Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. China claims its measures are a justified defense of national security, targeting US trade restrictions on Chinese firms and industries. The actions come weeks before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea, raising concerns over a potential trade war. Historically, both nations have engaged in escalating tariffs and export controls, with the US using national security arguments to restrict Chinese access to technology, and China responding with similar measures. Experts note that both sides are strategically using economic tools to gain leverage, with China’s actions seen as 'pre-meeting choreography' and the US maintaining significant economic resilience. The article emphasizes how the trade conflict reflects deeper great power competition, where economic policy is increasingly tied to national security, and where neither side is willing to back down, leading to ongoing uncertainty in global markets.",
