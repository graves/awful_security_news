  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI director, has launched a legal defense strategy to have federal charges against him dropped, arguing that the prosecution is the result of a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unconstitutional. His attorneys claim that Trump’s actions—including public attacks on Comey and circumventing Senate confirmation—constitute retaliation for protected speech and unlawful executive overreach. They also argue that the Justice Department selectively prosecuted Comey while ignoring other top Trump administration officials, and that Halligan’s appointment after the 120-day interim limit expired violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case has drawn national attention due to its implications for executive power, prosecutorial independence, and constitutional safeguards against political retaliation.",
