  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser under Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information after a multi-year investigation that began with a 2021 suspected Iranian cyberattack on his AOL email account. Prosecutors alleged that Bolton shared over a thousand pages of classified information via personal emails to his wife and daughter. The case, which had been officially closed in 2021 over the publication of his 2020 memoir, was reignited after the breach and the subsequent FBI investigation. Despite political pressure from President Trump, who repeatedly criticized Bolton and called for prosecution, the case was built by six career prosecutors, including Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara, with support from the Justice Department's counterintelligence unit. A search of Bolton’s home and office in August 2025 uncovered documents labeled 'secret' and 'classified,' including those related to weapons of mass destruction. The indictment was finalized after internal delays and political pressure, with prosecutors affirming that the materials were personal diaries, not classified. This case underscores the tension between political influence and institutional integrity in U.S. criminal investigations, especially in cases involving former political allies and critics.",
