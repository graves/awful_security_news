  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, sparked by China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and the US response with a threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods. This escalation occurs just before a scheduled high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The conflict reflects a broader pattern of economic and technological rivalry, with both nations using export controls, tariffs, and national security arguments to gain strategic advantage. The US has long imposed tariffs and restricted access to critical technologies, especially semiconductors and chips, citing national security. In response, China has tightened its rare earth exports, a vital resource for US defense and technology industries. Experts note that the dispute reveals a deeper trend of great power competition, where economic interdependence is weaponized. While the US has broader economic resilience, China’s reliance on exports makes it vulnerable. The outcome hinges less on diplomatic negotiations and more on global market reactions, with both sides maintaining escalation tools in reserve to assert dominance.",
