  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is constructing a $250 million, 90,000 sq ft White House ballroom, with construction beginning in October 2025. The project has raised significant ethical concerns, particularly over potential 'pay-to-play' arrangements where corporate and wealthy donors gain access to the White House in exchange for large financial contributions. Donors, including executives from Blackstone, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Coinbase, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin, as well as owners of NFL teams like Woody Johnson and the Glazers, have been present at a donor event. YouTube has pledged $22 million as part of a settlement over the Capitol riot, making it the only confirmed donor. Donors may receive public recognition such as names etched into the structure. While the White House claims the renovation will not cost taxpayers and is necessary due to lack of space for state events, legal experts like Richard Painter warn it may set a dangerous precedent for political access and influence. Historical examples, including Bill Clintonâ€™s use of the Lincoln Bedroom, are cited to illustrate similar ethical concerns in past administrations.",
