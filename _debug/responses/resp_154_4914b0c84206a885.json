  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that food deliveries to Gaza remain critically low at just 750 tonnes per day, far below the 2,000-tonne target, due to only two active border crossings — Karem Abu Salem and al-Karara — being open. Despite an increase from five to 26 food distribution points, most are in the south and center, with no access to the north due to restrictions on Salah al-Din Street and the continued closure of the Rafah crossing. Humanitarian aid has not reached northern Gaza, and residents are rationing and storing food out of fear of renewed conflict. The ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump is seen as vital to sustaining aid, and the 20-point plan calls for full access to all crossings. Hamas has so far returned 13 of 28 captives’ bodies, with the remaining 15 still pending. The WFP emphasizes that opening more crossings is essential to prevent famine, especially in northern Gaza where the most vulnerable populations are affected.",
