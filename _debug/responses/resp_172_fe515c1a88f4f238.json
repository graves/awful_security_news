    "Eurostar has ordered 30 'Celestia' double-decker trains from Alstom, with the option for 20 more, representing a 30% increase in its fleet.",
    "The trains will be 200 meters long and, when paired, will offer a total of about 1,080 seats, marking the first time double-decker high-speed trains will operate through the Channel Tunnel.",
    "The expansion includes significant investment in the Temple Mills depot in London, which is the only UK depot capable of accommodating the larger trains.",
    "The trains will undergo a multi-year certification process across all Eurostar-operating countries due to safety and technical standards.",
    "Each train will be 4.33 meters high—just 16 cm taller than current E320 models—minimizing compatibility issues with existing infrastructure.",
    "Despite the innovation, experts like Pete Waterman argue that widespread adoption of double-deckers across the UK rail network is unlikely due to age and structural limitations of the existing infrastructure.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eurostar has announced a major expansion by ordering up to 50 double-decker 'Celestia' trains from Alstom, with the first six scheduled to enter service in 2031. This marks the first time double-decker high-speed trains will operate through the Channel Tunnel, offering about 1,080 seats when two trains run together. The new trains will be slightly taller than current models, and will require extensive certification across all Eurostar operating countries. The expansion includes a €80 million investment in the Temple Mills depot in London, the only UK facility capable of housing the larger trains. While Eurostar aims to grow its passenger numbers from 19.5 million to 30 million, experts such as music producer Pete Waterman warn that widespread adoption of double-deckers across the UK rail network is unlikely due to outdated infrastructure. Meanwhile, rival operators including Evolyn, Virgin, and a Gemini Trains–Uber partnership are seeking access to the Temple Mills depot, prompting the Office of Rail and Road to review access policies.",
