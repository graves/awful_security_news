    "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals, up from 376 in the previous year.",
    "The population growth is attributed to new conservation efforts, including improved maritime regulations and fishing gear management.",
    "North Atlantic right whales are vulnerable to ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear, which have historically caused high mortality and reproductive failure.",
    "A key positive development is that four mother whales had calves in 2025, with shorter intervals between calves among established mothers, indicating improved reproductive health.",
    "Only 11 calves were born in 2025, which is below researchers’ hopes, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging.",
    "The population shows cautious optimism due to no detected mortalities and fewer injuries than in recent years.",
    "Environmental groups warn that ongoing threats and policy rollbacks of marine protection laws, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, could jeopardize recovery.",
    "New management measures in Canada, especially in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, have been critical in safeguarding the whales as they migrate.",
    "Scientists emphasize that sustained modest annual growth is essential for long-term recovery, and that continued conservation is vital to prevent a reversal of progress."
