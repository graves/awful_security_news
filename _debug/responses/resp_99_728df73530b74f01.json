  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing mounting pressure to withdraw from the race, primarily from his boss John Catsimatidis and other Republicans aligned with Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo, running as an independent, is pushing Sliwa out of the race, arguing he is not a viable alternative to the Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa has strongly rejected this, asserting that he represents blue-collar workers and that billionaire donors should not determine who runs for mayor. Despite pressure from figures like Trump, who mocked Sliwa's personal interests, Sliwa has doubled down on his campaign, emphasizing the importance of voter choice. Tensions have also emerged over possible coordination between Sliwa and Mamdani, though Mamdani denies such coordination, stressing that New Yorkers should decide their future independently.",
