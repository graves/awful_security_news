  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite deep political polarization in 2025, hundreds of cancer survivors and advocates from across the U.S., including Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin from New York, united in Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress during a citizen advocacy day organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The event, held on September 16, 2025, brought together individuals with diverse political affiliations—some Republican, some Democrat—united only by their personal experiences with cancer. The volunteers, armed with personal stories and red information folders, visited 484 congressional offices to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening, and continued health insurance subsidies. Though some Republican lawmakers opposed subsidies, both parties supported research and screening. The day culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, where 10,000 tea lights honored individuals affected by cancer. The event underscores a powerful message: in the face of national political division, shared personal experiences—such as illness or loss—can foster empathy, dialogue, and collective action.",
