  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a close gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill faces off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite the state’s historical blue leanings. The race is notable for its personal attacks—Sherrill claims Ciattarelli’s company downplayed opioid dangers and that he caused mass deaths, while Ciattarelli blames Sherrill for being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation in 1994. National figures like Donald Trump and Barack Obama have endorsed the candidates, adding national stakes. Voter concerns center on affordability, with rising electricity costs and property taxes playing a major role. Experts note that New Jersey has a history of bipartisan governors, and a victory by Sherrill would mark the first time since the 1960s that a governor from the same party has served three consecutive terms.",
