The rebels confiscated all communication equipment, disrupting humanitarian operations. The detained personnel include staff from key UN agencies such as the World Food Program, UNICEF, and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. This follows a broader pattern of Houthi crackdowns in Sanaa, Hodeida, and Saada, where they have repeatedly accused UN staff of espionage—a claim the UN has denied. The UN has suspended operations in Saada and relocated its top humanitarian coordinator to Aden, reflecting the deteriorating security and operational environment. The incident underscores the ongoing threat to international humanitarian efforts in Yemen and the geopolitical tensions involving Iran and the Houthi rebels.",
