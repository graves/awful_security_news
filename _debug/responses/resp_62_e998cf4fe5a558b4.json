  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes growing military and political tensions between the United States and Venezuela under President Donald Trump, highlighting increased U.S. military activity—including Navy presence and Air Force B-52 bomber flights—and the authorization of covert CIA operations targeting drug-related vessels. It also reports the unexpected retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, a sign of internal friction. While Trump may be attempting to pressure Venezuela into compliance through regime change or military intervention, the article emphasizes that such actions are politically risky and face strong public opposition. Polling data from organizations like the Chicago Council and Reuters-Ipsos show that Americans generally oppose unilateral military interventions abroad, even for purposes like combating drug trafficking. The article concludes that Trump’s actions represent a significant shift in foreign policy toward greater militarism and could backfire due to lack of public support and the absence of credible evidence linking Venezuela to major threats to the U.S.",
