  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine after four weeks without off-site power, the longest blackout since the war began. The restoration efforts are being enabled by rare UN-backed ceasefire zones, allowing repairs to resume. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stresses that off-site power is essential for nuclear safety, and both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of causing the outage—Ukraine claims Russian sabotage, Russia blames Ukrainian shelling. The plant has lost connection to the grid ten times since the war started, and ongoing attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including a recent strike on Slavutych, have heightened regional risks. Ukrainian officials maintain that Russian military aggression and occupation are the primary threats to nuclear safety, while Russian forces claim their military presence is necessary to protect workers from shelling.",
