  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals that Israel has tortured and killed over 100 Palestinian detainees since October 2023, with bodies returned to Gaza showing severe physical abuse, burns, missing limbs, and signs of execution. Many detainees were subjected to beatings, gang rape, and psychological torture, including false claims about family deaths. A documented incident at Sde Teiman prison involved guards raping a detainee with shields to hide the act. Despite international reports from organizations like B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, Israel has denied abuse, with officials like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir defending punitive treatment. Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti remains imprisoned and alleges he has been beaten multiple times. The ceasefire deal released nearly 2,000 Palestinians, many of whom are severely injured or traumatized, and family members are left devastated by the conditions of the released bodies and the lack of identification. The article calls for urgent international investigations into these alleged war crimes.",
