    "Agricultural recovery is vital for food security, but the persistence of violence and the lack of trust in state protection have made farming dangerous and unfeasible for many."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno State, farmers face life-threatening attacks from Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), with targeted killings increasing sharply since 2024. Despite government efforts to reintegrate displaced farmers through initiatives like the Agro Rangers—armed guards meant to protect farming areas—many report persistent fear, kidnappings, and deaths. Farmers like Aisha Isa, Mustapha Musa, and Baba Modu describe living in constant danger, with some having lost family members. While officials such as Mohammed Hassan Agalama and James Bulus claim progress and normalcy, farmers assert that the military lacks sufficient coverage and that attacks continue unabated. The article highlights a growing crisis of food insecurity affecting over four million people, and criticizes both the scale of the Agro Rangers program and the speed of farmer resettlement as inadequate and risky. The situation underscores the urgent need for long-term, sustainable security and agricultural recovery in conflict-affected regions.",
