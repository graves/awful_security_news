  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of AI-generated voice scams has targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to imitate the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto and request large financial transfers. The scams, which occurred in early February 2025, were made possible by advances in AI voice cloning, which can now produce voices indistinguishable from real human ones. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that 58% of AI voice clones were mistaken for real voices, and participants often rated AI voices as more trustworthy than real ones. The scam targeted prominent figures like Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, with only Massimo Moratti transferring funds. Global losses from such scams have risen to over $547 million between January and June 2025. The misuse of AI voice technology is also growing in areas such as fake news and non-consensual sexual content, prompting governments like the U.S. and Australia to introduce legal bans and restrictions. While AI voice technology offers benefits such as restoring speech for those with disabilities, the potential for abuse and identity theft raises serious ethical and security concerns for individuals and society at large.",
