These incidents, attributed to unauthorized access by third parties, disrupted operations, caused passenger confusion, and triggered investigations by federal agencies including the FAA, Transport Canada, and the RCMP. While no physical threats or security breaches were found, the events highlight a growing vulnerability in airport communication systems to cyber intrusions, especially amid a broader trend of cyberattacks on the aviation industry. The attacks underscore concerns about foreign influence, disinformation, and the potential for cyberattacks to manipulate public perception and disrupt critical infrastructure.",
