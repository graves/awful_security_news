  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, Illinois, in response to protests at an ICE facility in the suburbs, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supports presidential deference in similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that protests constitute 'violent resistance' and that the president’s judgment of national emergency is unreviewable or at least entitled to great deference, supported by the 1827 Supreme Court precedent in Martin v. Mott. The Department of Justice frames the action as part of a broader national threat, including violence in other cities and threats from cartels. However, Illinois officials and courts, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, dispute this, asserting that protests are not equivalent to riots and that local law enforcement has adequately managed the situation. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision soon, with the outcome potentially setting a precedent for future National Guard deployments across the U.S.",
