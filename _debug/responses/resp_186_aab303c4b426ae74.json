  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is beginning demolition of parts of its East Wing in 2025 to construct a new $250 million ballroom for President Donald Trump, who claims the project will respect the original building and be 'near' but not touching it. Despite Trump's assertions, the project marks the first major change to the East Wing’s exterior since 1942, triggering criticism from architectural and historical experts who argue it bypasses standard National Park Service review processes and violates long-standing traditions of preserving the White House’s historic integrity. The renovation is being managed by Clark Construction and designed by McCrery Architects, with the Secret Service handling security. Critics, including former NPS chief Robert K. Sutton and organizations like the Society of Architectural Historians and American Institute of Architects, warn that the project reflects a lack of due process, transparency, and respect for historical continuity. This development is significant because it signals a shift in how the White House is being modernized—moving from precedent-based, slowly approved renovations to a rapid, president-driven change that raises concerns about cultural heritage and institutional accountability.",
