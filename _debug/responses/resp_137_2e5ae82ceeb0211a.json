  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals growing public anxiety about the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump, marked by declining confidence in job prospects and rising costs of living. While inflation and tariffs have persisted, with some blaming Trump’s policies for increased prices in food, housing, and energy, public approval of his economic leadership remains low at 36%, despite strong support among Republicans. The survey shows that 47% of Americans are not confident they could find a good job, and a majority report financial stress over groceries, housing, health care, and gasoline. Despite broader economic indicators like low unemployment, the public perceives economic instability, especially among younger adults and low-income households. These concerns signal a potential weakening of Republican political momentum in upcoming elections, as trust in Trump’s economic promises erodes amid ongoing inflation, hiring freezes, and partisan conflict.",
