    "The global shipping industry, responsible for about 3% of annual climate pollution (projected to rise to 17% by 2050), was targeted by a proposed legally binding carbon tax to fund emissions reductions.",

    "The tax was initially approved by IMO member nations in April 2025 but abandoned mid-session; a formal vote was delayed by 12 months after a contentious negotiation.",
    "Despite support from the European Union, Brazil, and small island states like Vanuatu, oil-producing nations including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia opposed the tax, citing economic burdens on consumers and shipping companies.",

Despite support from the European Union, Brazil, and small island nations like Vanuatu, the United States, led by President Donald Trump, strongly opposed the tax, branding it a 'scam tax' and threatening sanctions including port restrictions and visa bans on countries backing it. The tax was initially approved in April 2025 but abandoned mid-session, with member states agreeing to delay a formal vote by 12 months. Experts warn that the failure undermines global climate diplomacy, slows the transition to clean shipping, and signals a broader erosion of climate ambition, particularly ahead of the upcoming COP30 conference in Belém, Brazil.",
