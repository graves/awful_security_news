  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, has publicly transitioned from identifying as a Democrat to an independent, citing deep internal disunity, political disloyalty, and a failure to anticipate the 2024 election defeat and the rise of anti-DEI and anti-immigrant policies under Project 2025. In her new book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' she recounts the 2024 presidential debate where she observed Biden’s health and noted how political scrutiny intensified, reinforcing concerns about party cohesion. She blames the Democratic Party’s disunity—exemplified by public doubts from figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney—for weakening public support. Jean-Pierre also highlights systemic bias against Black women in political roles, crediting the Biden-Harris administration for recognizing and uplifting their voices. Ultimately, her shift to independence is framed not as a rebellion, but as a call for accountability, political transparency, and a reimagining of what American democracy can be—emphasizing that silence in the face of political threats is complicit.",
