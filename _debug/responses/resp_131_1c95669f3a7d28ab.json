  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced new export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five newly added ones, and restricted specialized equipment used to refine these metals. The controls, set to take effect on December 1, 2025, require foreign companies to obtain special approvals and justify the intended use of products containing rare-earth materials. China justifies these measures on national security grounds, citing concerns about foreign entities using Chinese rare-earth materials for military applications. The move occurs just weeks before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting a strategic signaling effort to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The U.S. is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and relies on them for critical defense systems, including F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI-driven semiconductors, as well as for consumer technologies like electric vehicles and smartphones. Analysts view the move as a calculated effort to widen the U.S. defense capability gap and signal China’s ability to disrupt supply chains, even though such actions may harm both economies due to interdependence. Exemptions exist for emergency medical and disaster relief uses.",
