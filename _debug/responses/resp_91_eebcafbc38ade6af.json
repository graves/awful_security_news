  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and drones—over 3,270 drones and 1,370 bombs in one week—to target Ukrainian military and infrastructure. Key areas of pressure include Kupiansk, Vovchansk, and Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian forces are resisting advances and claiming territorial recaptures. Although Russia has improved its battlefield tactics, including drone warfare and armored systems, it has suffered heavy casualties—estimated at 250,000 deaths—leading to internal recruitment shifts. Ukraine continues long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting up to one-fifth of refining capacity. Despite these efforts, Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unyielding in refusing ceasefire negotiations, and analysts suggest that neither side holds full strategic initiative, indicating a stalemate with ongoing, costly attrition warfare.",
