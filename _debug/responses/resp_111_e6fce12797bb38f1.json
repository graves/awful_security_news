    "Tech CEOs such as Dario Amodei, Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have made bold claims about AI writing significant portions of code, suggesting a shift toward AI-driven software development.",
    "Despite aggressive rhetoric, many software engineers remain skeptical, citing that AI-generated code often requires extensive human review and correction, and that real-world efficiency gains are modest or absent.",
    "AI tools are most effective in generating quick prototypes and handling repetitive tasks, but fail in complex problem-solving, which remains the domain of human engineers.",
    "Studies show mixed results: a METR study found experienced engineers took 19% longer with AI tools, while a Danish survey reported a 6.5% time saving — considered modest compared to expected gains.",
    "AI tools are being overused or misapplied, leading to 'workslaps' — messy, unreviewable code that creates more work for teams, and fosters a culture of compliance over critical evaluation.",
    "Human oversight and review are essential: experts like Boris Cherny and Simon Willison emphasize that every line of code should be reviewed by a human engineer, even if generated by AI.",
    "Some companies, like Amazon and Meta, have pushed AI mandates, resulting in employee pressure to use tools without clear benefit, and even leading to firings of engineers who didn’t comply.",
    "Concerns exist about long-term talent supply, as AI may displace junior software engineers, and about the environmental cost of training large AI models on vast human-generated content.",
    "The focus of startup incubators like Y Combinator has shifted entirely to AI, signaling a broader industry trend toward AI-centric innovation."

However, software engineers remain skeptical, citing that AI-generated code often requires extensive human review, fails in complex problem-solving, and leads to poor-quality, unworkable 'death spiral' loops. Studies show mixed results: some engineers report modest time savings, while others — especially experienced ones — take longer due to errors and inefficiencies. The use of AI tools is often misapplied, leading to a phenomenon called 'workslaps' where code becomes messy and unreviewable. Despite industry enthusiasm, experts stress that human oversight is essential, and AI cannot replace human judgment in designing and solving real-world software problems. Companies like Amazon and Meta have pushed AI mandates, even leading to firings of engineers who didn't use AI tools, raising concerns about talent displacement and overreliance. Meanwhile, startup incubators like Y Combinator have shifted entirely to AI-focused ventures, signaling a broader trend in technological investment and focus.",
