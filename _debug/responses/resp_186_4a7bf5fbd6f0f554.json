  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the end of US aid to Colombia, citing Colombian President Gustavo Petro as a 'drug leader' who fails to curb drug production. The decision follows a September military strike by the US on a Colombian fishing boat, allegedly killing fisherman Alejandro Carranza, which Petro condemned as a violation of sovereignty and 'murder'. The US claims the boats carry fentanyl and other drugs, but has not provided evidence. The incident, part of a broader pattern of US military operations in the Caribbean, has drawn criticism from UN human rights experts who label the actions as 'extrajudicial executions'. Colombia, which previously received over $740 million in US aid in 2023, now faces a potential cutoff. The situation is further complicated by US threats to conduct covert operations in Venezuela and attacks on Venezuelan soil, following accusations from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that the US is attempting to make Venezuela an American colony.",
