  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago to address protests at an ICE facility, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that upheld the president’s authority to deploy guard forces in Portland and Los Angeles. The administration argues that such actions are unreviewable or entitled to judicial deference and relies on the 1827 Supreme Court case Martin v. Mott to affirm presidential power in emergency decisions. However, state and local officials, including Judge April Perry and the 7th Circuit, oppose the deployment, asserting that protests are not equivalent to riots and that state law enforcement is sufficient. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision soon, which could set a precedent for future National Guard deployments during civil unrest across the U.S.",
