The Trump administration defended the law, citing public safety risks from armed, impaired individuals, while the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that habitual users should not be targeted.

Hemani’s legal team argues the historical basis for the law is weak, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana, suggesting a large overlap between lawful drug use and gun ownership. The case is significant not only legally but also politically, due to the prior conviction and pardon of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, under the same law.
