  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reveals widespread labor exploitation in Guatemala's maquila garment factories, where workers—mostly women—face brutal conditions, including long hours, daily quotas, sexual harassment, and wage theft, while being largely invisible to US brands. Despite their economic importance, these workers have little legal protection, with union activity frequently met with violence or dismissal. Korean-owned companies dominate the sector, controlling nearly two-thirds of investments and enabling exploitative practices. US fashion brands like Target, Ralph Lauren, and Carhartt benefit from low-cost clothing without direct responsibility for labor conditions. A lack of enforcement by the Guatemalan labor ministry and resistance from factory management further perpetuate abuse. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra endure financial devastation, including loss of pensions and severance, and many, like Alexandra, choose to exit the sector to protect future generations. Though progressive reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo aim to improve conditions, systemic power imbalances and institutional failures continue to undermine efforts to protect workers.",
