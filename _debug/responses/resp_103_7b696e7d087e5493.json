    "Enshittification is a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe how internet platforms degrade over time, shifting from user-focused services to profit-driven, exploitative models.",
    "The process occurs in three stages: (1) user acquisition through incentives and network effects, (2) favoring business partners at the expense of users, and (3) financial exploitation of both users and businesses, resulting in reduced value and increased costs.",
    "Platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber are cited as examples where enshittification has occurred, particularly through data exploitation, predatory pricing, and algorithmic manipulation.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to lack of competition and weak consumer protections, arguing that platforms have 'moats' (like network effects and high switching costs) that prevent users from leaving.",
    "Proposed solutions include stronger antitrust enforcement, ending the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law, enabling 'right-to-exit' policies (e.g., taking e-books with you), and promoting interoperability between services and devices.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have publicly disputed Doctorow's claims, with Amazon asserting that its services have improved and that claims of 'junk fees' and product cloning are false or misleading.",
    "The article highlights growing public and international concern over tech monopolies and calls for regulatory reform to restore user trust and platform fairness."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow introduces and defends the concept of 'enshittification' — the degradation of internet platforms into exploitative systems that prioritize profit over user value. He outlines a three-stage process: initial user acquisition through attractive offers, then prioritizing business partners at the expense of users, and finally financial exploitation of both users and businesses. Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon are cited as examples where this pattern has occurred. Doctorow attributes the decline to a lack of competition and weak regulation, and proposes solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, a right-to-exit policy, and increased interoperability. Amazon and Facebook have disputed his claims, but the article underscores growing public concern about platform power and calls for regulatory reform to reverse the trend of internet platforms turning into 'piles of crap'.",
