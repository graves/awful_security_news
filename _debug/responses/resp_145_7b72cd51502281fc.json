  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF)—a plan to reduce shipping emissions by implementing a global carbon tax of $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent—by at least 12 months, following threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on countries supporting the measure. Despite earlier approval in April, the vote in London was influenced by political pressure, with key nations like China, the EU, and Britain maintaining support, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted or voted to postpone. Industry leaders and climate advocates, including the International Chamber of Shipping and Vanuatu’s minister, criticized the delay as undermining climate goals and investment clarity. The NZF, aimed at cutting shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050, remains a critical step in addressing climate change impacts on shipping, including altered ocean currents and storm frequency.",
