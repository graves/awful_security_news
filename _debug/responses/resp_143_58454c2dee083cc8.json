  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Human Rights Watch has released a report alleging that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is contributing to illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas in Pará. The investigation reveals a major gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be moved through a 'laundering' system that obscures their origins. This is made possible by Brazil’s outdated livestock tracking system, which uses bulk transit permits (GTAs) that lack individual animal records. The report documents encroachments in protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where Indigenous and traditional communities face violence, displacement, and environmental destruction. JBS previously committed in 2009 to trace all indirect suppliers by 2011 but failed to deliver. While Pará’s governor and the federal Ministry of Agriculture have introduced traceability mandates for 2026 and 2032 respectively, Human Rights Watch warns the timeline is too slow and enforcement is weak. Experts emphasize that full transparency, public access to GTA data, and universal market requirements are essential to hold companies accountable and halt deforestation in the Amazon.",
