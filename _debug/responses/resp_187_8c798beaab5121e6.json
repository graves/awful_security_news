  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia's former president Alvaro Uribe has had two criminal convictions for fraud and bribery overturned by the Superior Court in Bogotá. The original conviction, based on testimony from former paramilitary commander Luis Carlos Velez, was found to lack credibility, and the court also determined that key wiretaps used to initiate the investigation were obtained illegally. The ruling, which spans 700 pages, reflects a significant reversal in a high-profile political case. The decision has drawn strong reactions from both domestic and international figures: current President Gustavo Petro criticized the outcome as an effort to cover up paramilitary ties and drug trafficking in Colombian politics, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended Uribe, calling his actions a defense of national sovereignty. The case underscores the complex legacy of Colombia’s armed conflict, where paramilitary and guerrilla groups have both committed atrocities and influenced political power structures.",
