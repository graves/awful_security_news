  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state Assembly member and pro-Trump politician. Despite New Jersey’s blue political leanings in national elections, the race is tightly contested, with polls showing a tie in some cases. The campaign is marked by personal attacks: Ciattarelli accuses Sherrill of being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal, while Sherrill alleges Ciattarelli’s medical company downplayed opioid dangers and claims he is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. President Donald Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli, while former President Barack Obama endorsed Sherrill. Both candidates emphasize affordability, with voters concerned about rising energy costs and property taxes. Experts note that New Jersey has a history of alternating governors from both parties, and no governor from the same party has served three consecutive terms since the 1960s. If Sherrill wins, she would become the first since the 1960s to serve three consecutive terms as governor. The race is seen as a pivotal moment in New Jersey politics, reflecting national trends and voter priorities on cost of living and political authenticity.",
