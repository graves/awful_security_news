    "The Pentagon under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has sidelined top military lawyers, including Lt. Gen. Joe Berger and Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer, by firing them after they raised legal concerns about the legality of policies such as deploying National Guard troops for immigration enforcement and firing large numbers of probationary civil servants.",
    "Hegseth has reduced the rank requirement for top uniformed legal officers from three stars to two stars, effectively demoting them and excluding them from key decision-making meetings.",

    "The legal concerns raised by military lawyers — including over the Caribbean strikes and the legality of war crimes investigations — are being dismissed or ignored, with top legal experts like Michael D’Annunzio being removed from key advisory roles.",
    "Defense officials and current JAG officers express deep concern that the new administration is undermining the independence and authority of military legal advisors, potentially weakening the legal foundation of military actions and operations.",
    "Hegseth’s personal experience in Iraq and his perception of JAGs as politically biased or obstructive, including the war crimes probe involving Col. Michael Steele, have shaped his strong opposition to military legal oversight."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon has systematically sidelined top military lawyers, including Lt. Gen. Joe Berger and Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer, by firing them for raising legal concerns about policies such as deploying National Guard troops for immigration and mass firing of civil servants. Hegseth has also demoted top legal officers from three-star to two-star ranks, removed key legal experts like Michael D’Annunzio from the Pentagon, and redirected JAGs to serve in the Justice Department as immigration judges. These actions reflect a broader effort to undermine the independence and authority of military legal advice, with officials warning that the erosion of legal oversight threatens the rule of law in military operations, including controversial strikes in the Caribbean and political events at military bases. Military lawyers, despite their constitutional duty to provide independent legal advice, are increasingly afraid of speaking up due to political pressure and fear of dismissal.",
