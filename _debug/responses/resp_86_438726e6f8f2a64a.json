  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in modern American culture, driven by political trends, media, and fashion. It traces the roots of the cowboy myth to 19th-century performances like the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and the romanticized portrayals of cowboys in films and politics. The current wave of cowboy popularity—seen in fashion, TV shows like 'Yellowstone,' Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' tour, and political figures such as Donald Trump—is tied to conservative values of individualism, patriotism, and traditionalism. However, the article emphasizes that this image is largely a myth, detached from the historical reality of cowboys who were predominantly Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. The article also highlights the growing visibility of Black cowboy culture, such as in the Bill Pickett Rodeo and the work of photographer Gabriela Hasbun, and critiques how mainstream narratives often 'whitewash' this history. Ultimately, the article presents the cowboy as a cultural symbol that reflects broader political and societal tensions, with its current prominence serving as both a reflection of national identity and a perpetuation of historical erasure.",
