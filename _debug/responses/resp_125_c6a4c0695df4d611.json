  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a 5-year prison sentence on October 21, 2025, becoming the first ex-leader of modern France to be imprisoned, after being convicted of criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya under Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. The court ruled that he must serve time immediately, despite pending appeal, citing serious disruption to public order. Sarkozy, 70, is being held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, with limited contact and daily outdoor time. His legal team contests both the conviction and the incarceration, calling it a judicial scandal. A significant public display of support has emerged, with citizens chanting 'Courage Nicolas' and asserting his innocence. President Emmanuel Macron hosted Sarkozy and refrained from commenting directly, while France’s top magistrate Rémy Heitz warned that political visits to the prisoner could undermine judicial independence. Sarkozy has expressed defiance, stating he will fight until the end and plans to write a book about his experience.",
