migration cases. This shift prompted a wave of legal challenges and civil society protests. Human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, raised concerns about the treatment of migrants in detention facilities, citing reports of abuse and lack of legal access. The European Union echoed these concerns in July 2023, calling for urgent reform of national immigration systems. In August 2023, a court ruled that indefinite detention violates the principle of proportionality under international human rights law. In response, civil society groups, including a prominent migrant advocacy group, launched legal campaigns to challenge the constitutionality of indefinite detention. By October 2023, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling for an independent investigation into migrant detention practices. In November 2023, a documentary released by a major human rights organization exposed the harsh conditions in migrant holding centers. The government responded by proposing a new asylum reform bill in June 2023 and initiated family reunification programs in September 2023. Despite these actions, the ongoing debate reflects a deep tension between immigration control and the protection of fundamental human rights.","tags":["immigration policy", "human rights", "migrant detention", "indefinite detention", "asylum reform", "international criticism", "legal challenges", "civil society protests", "family reunification", "UN human rights council"],"timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-04:00","title":"Global Human Rights Concerns Emerge Over Migrant Detention Practices and New Immigration Policies in 2023"}
