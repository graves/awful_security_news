  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s newly elected President Jose Jeri declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital Lima and neighboring province of Callao in response to escalating crime and violent protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured. The emergency, approved by the Council of Ministers and effective just after midnight on October 21, 2025, permits the deployment of armed forces and police to restore public order. This action follows the ousting of former President Dina Boluarte, who had previously declared a similar emergency in March 2025, and reflects both a political shift and ongoing public demand for security reforms. Despite the government's pledge to take a 'defensive to offensive' approach in crime fighting, analysts caution that repeated emergency measures have not proven effective in reducing crime levels, raising broader questions about the sustainability and impact of such policies.",
