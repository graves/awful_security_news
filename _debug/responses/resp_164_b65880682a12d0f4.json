  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the construction of a new $250 million ballroom in the White House East Wing, marking the first major structural change to the building since 1948. The project, which began in early October 2025, is being carried out without formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a government shutdown. Trump claims the ballroom will be built privately, funded by himself and private donors, and will not interfere with the main White House structure. The new space, estimated at 90,000 square feet with seating for up to 999 guests, will allow for larger state dinners and gatherings, addressing a long-standing need for a dedicated ballroom. The East Wing, which has housed the First Lady’s offices since 1977, will be reconstructed, with offices temporarily relocated. The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM. Despite the lack of oversight and approval, the initiative reflects broader political and public interest in modernizing the White House for high-level diplomacy and social events.",
