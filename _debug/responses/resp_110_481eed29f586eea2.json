  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense to return nearly 600 books on race and gender to school libraries at military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy, and Japan after students and families alleged that the removals violated their First Amendment rights. These books, covering topics like sexual identity, racism, and LGBTQ pride, were removed under executive orders by former President Donald Trump and guidance from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, which banned instruction on Critical Race Theory, DEI, and gender ideology. The American Civil Liberties Union, including regional chapters in Virginia and Kentucky, filed a legal motion arguing that the removals were politically motivated and suppressed student expression. The judge ruled that the actions were not pedagogical but rooted in improper partisan motives, and ordered the immediate restoration of the materials. Cancellations of events like Black History Month, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and the removal of images of Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo further illustrate the broader impact of the policy on inclusive education.",
