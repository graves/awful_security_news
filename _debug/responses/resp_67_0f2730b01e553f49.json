  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A total of 12 of the 28 deceased hostages from the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack have been returned to Israel, including the identification of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Israeli citizen Ronen Engel. The bodies were handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross and then to Israel for formal identification. This return has intensified public and political pressure, especially in Israel, where protests are growing over delays in retrieving all bodies. The ceasefire, which entered its second week, is under strain due to Hamas’s claims of limited access to remains, accusations of withholding bodies for leverage, and continued Israeli military strikes, including one on a civilian vehicle that killed nine people. The Rafah crossing remains closed, blocking vital humanitarian aid. The US State Department warns of an imminent Hamas ceasefire violation, while Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains and criticizes Israel’s actions. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insist the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed, underscoring the centrality of body recovery to the peace process.",
