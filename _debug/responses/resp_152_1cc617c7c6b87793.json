  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a Gaza ceasefire agreement, Israel and Hamas have exchanged the remains of 15 Israeli captives and 15 Palestinian detainees, with the bodies of two Israeli captives—Aryeh Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar—being returned on Tuesday and Wednesday. Despite these exchanges, Hamas accuses Israel of failing to uphold key terms, particularly by refusing to reopen the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which has remained closed since May 2024. The crossing’s closure, despite an order from the International Court of Justice, severely limits humanitarian access and medical aid to Gaza. Human rights groups report that some Palestinian detainees were still shackled and abused, and Palestinian leaders like Ubai Al-Aboudi and Mujahid Muhammad Darwish describe the situation as one of systemic dehumanization and unlawful detention. The broader context includes the return of 20 living Palestinian detainees and the ongoing dispute over the status of prisoners, with Hamas maintaining commitment to the ceasefire despite ongoing violations.",
