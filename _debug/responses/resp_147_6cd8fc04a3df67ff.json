    "President Donald Trump claimed that each boat struck off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 U.S. lives, totaling at least 100,000 lives saved from five strikes.",
    "The Trump administration provided no evidence of the type or quantity of drugs on the boats, making it impossible to verify the life-saving claim.",
    "Drug experts state that Venezuela plays a minor role in U.S. drug trafficking, with most illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. from Mexico through southern border ports.",
    "If the boats carried 25,000 lethal doses each, the claim would imply 125,000 deaths prevented — nearly double the number of U.S. drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025 (73,000).",
    "The CDC data shows a decline in overdose deaths in recent years, suggesting that drug interception efforts are not directly correlated with reductions in overdose fatalities.",
    "The legality of the strikes is contested; experts argue that the actions violate maritime law and contradict longstanding U.S. military practices.",
    "Aerial videos shared by Trump show boat strikes, but no visible drugs like fentanyl are present, undermining the claim of drug presence.",
    "Experts like Jonathan Caulkins and Alene Kennedy-Hendricks state that drug seizure data cannot be directly converted into lives saved due to supply chain resilience and variable drug potency."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that each military strike on boats off the coast of Venezuela saved 25,000 American lives, asserting that the operations stopped drug smuggling, particularly of fentanyl. However, experts have challenged the claim by noting that Venezuela plays a minor role in U.S. drug trafficking, no evidence was provided about the drugs or quantities on the boats, and the number of lives saved would exceed the actual annual U.S. overdose deaths. Additionally, the legality of the strikes under international law is questioned, and experts argue that drug seizures do not equate to lives saved due to drug supply chain resilience. PolitiFact concluded that Trump’s statement is false.",
