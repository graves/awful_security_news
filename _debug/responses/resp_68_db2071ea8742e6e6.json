  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with threatening to assault, kidnap, or murder U.S. federal officials, specifically immigration agents from ICE, after posting a series of TikTok videos between August and October 2025. In one video, he allegedly urged people to shoot ICE agents when they appear in neighborhoods, and in another, he referenced the murder of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, saying 'do a lot more Charlie Kirks.' Federal investigators became aware of his activities after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, which flagged a request for Israeli military locations. Despite multiple attempts by federal agents to contact him, including a direct text from a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol supervisor on September 11, Stanton refused communication and sent hostile messages. He was arrested and indicted on three federal counts, including threats against a U.S. official, and remains in detention pending trial. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for December 1, 2025, and a trial is set for December 15, 2025. His attorney, John Bradley, maintains that the criminal complaint is based on allegations and that Stanton is presumed innocent.",
