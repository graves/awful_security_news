  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, the Trump administration is escalating its foreign policy posture toward Venezuela through increased military presence—including U.S. Navy buildups and B-52 bomber flights off the coast—and has authorized covert CIA operations. These actions are interpreted as part of a broader strategy to pressure Venezuela, possibly leading to regime change or targeted strikes, especially in response to claims of drug trafficking. However, such actions are politically risky, as public opinion is deeply skeptical of unilateral military intervention; polls show that a majority of Americans believe the U.S. should stay out of foreign affairs and oppose actions without allied consent. The sudden retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, a key military commander, further signals internal tensions over the administration's aggressive stance, raising concerns about both feasibility and domestic political fallout.",
