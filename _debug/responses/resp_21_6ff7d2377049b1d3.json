  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith have strongly rejected claims that investigators in the January 6 Capitol riot probe illegally wiretapped Republican members of Congress. The toll records, which only capture call timing and duration, were obtained under a 2023 court order and were limited to a four-day window immediately before and after the January 6 attack. Smith’s attorneys argue that the collection was narrowly tailored and legally justified, aimed at verifying whether President Trump or his allies attempted to contact senators to delay certification of the 2020 election results. They note that similar toll records were obtained in unrelated investigations involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez, suggesting the practice is part of standard law enforcement procedures, not politically motivated. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Dick Durbin, raised concerns during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging political weaponization, especially in connection with recent indictments of figures like James Comey.",
