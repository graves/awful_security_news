  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following a lengthy White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump urged both Ukraine and Russia to 'stop where they are' and end the war, advocating for a ceasefire at current battle lines and allowing history to decide the outcome. This marks a notable shift from Trump’s earlier support for Ukraine regaining lost territory to a more conciliatory stance emphasizing peace through de-escalation. Trump also expressed reluctance to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, citing U.S. national security concerns and the potential for damaging U.S.-Russia relations, despite Zelenskyy’s insistence that such weapons are essential for striking deep into Russian territory and compelling negotiations. Trump signaled plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, suggesting a potential 'double meeting' to facilitate direct talks, though Putin has shown no interest in engaging with Zelenskyy and continues to intensify attacks on Ukraine. The article reflects a significant evolution in U.S. foreign policy under Trump, balancing diplomatic outreach with strategic caution.",
