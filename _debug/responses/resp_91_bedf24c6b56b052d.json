Senators such as Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, and James Lankford have expressed opposition or reservation about supporting him. The Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that Ingrassia 'is not going to pass' his nomination, and the White House has not responded publicly. Ingrassia’s ties to White nationalist Nick Fuentes and his defense of Fuentes’ social media presence have further intensified scrutiny. While Ingrassia’s legal team has denied the authenticity of the messages, citing satire and manipulation, the political pressure from multiple Republican senators and the public controversy have effectively blocked the nomination from advancing to confirmation.",
