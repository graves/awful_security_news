    "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, has sparked debate over whether it is caused by pulsars or dark matter.",
    "New computer simulations show that dark matter — particularly in a squashed, egg-shaped distribution — could produce a bulge-like glow matching the observed shape of the galactic center, supporting the dark matter theory.",
    "The dark matter theory previously faced challenges due to the glow's shape, which resembled the stellar bulge rather than a spherical dark matter halo; however, updated simulations now suggest a non-spherical dark matter distribution is possible.",
    "Scientists believe that WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), a leading dark matter candidate, could annihilate and emit gamma rays, potentially explaining the observed glow.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), scheduled to operate from 2027, will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray data capable of distinguishing between pulsar and dark matter origins.",
    "Although the study does not provide definitive proof, it increases the plausibility of dark matter being responsible, with a 50% chance of being correct according to lead researcher Joseph Silk.",
    "If CTAO confirms the link, it would represent a major breakthrough in dark matter research; if not, the pulsar hypothesis would remain stronger."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new simulation using supercomputers suggests that dark matter — specifically in a non-spherical, egg-shaped distribution — could explain the mysterious gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While the glow previously appeared to favor pulsar explanations due to its bulge-like shape, updated models show that dark matter collisions could produce such a shape. This supports the idea that dark matter, particularly WIMPs, might be behind the glow. The key scientific shift is in modeling dark matter as not perfectly spherical, which better matches the observed data. A definitive answer may come from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin operations in 2027, which will detect gamma rays at higher resolution. While the study does not provide conclusive proof, it significantly strengthens the case for dark matter as a possible explanation, fueling ongoing efforts to detect WIMPs and solve one of the most fundamental mysteries in modern physics.",
