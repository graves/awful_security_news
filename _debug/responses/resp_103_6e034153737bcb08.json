  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warns that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025, as tens of millions of Americans face potential premium increases of up to $2,000 per month — potentially reaching over $24,000 annually. Jeffries argues that such hikes would make health insurance unaffordable for working-class households, particularly those earning around $63,000 a year. He opposes Republican proposals for a one-year extension of subsidies, criticizing them as inadequate and politically biased, especially given the historical cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for billionaires. Jeffries also rejects Republican plans to allow President Trump to unilaterally determine who among federal workers receives pay, calling it a 'political ploy' and a violation of federal law. As open enrollment begins and costs rise, he emphasizes that public awareness will mount, compelling Congress to act decisively to protect access to affordable health care.",
