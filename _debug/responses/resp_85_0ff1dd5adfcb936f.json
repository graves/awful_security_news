  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the October 2025 government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — typically supporting child nutrition — to fund the WIC program, which serves nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. Initially, Section 232 revenue was considered, but shifted due to legal and procedural concerns. The White House, through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, declared the move a 'creative solution' to prevent program closure, criticizing Democrats for enabling the shutdown. However, legal experts question the administration’s authority, arguing that Congress must explicitly appropriate funds for WIC. The National WIC Association welcomes the effort but stresses uncertainty around funding amounts, delivery timelines, and sustainability. The program has seen rising enrollment due to improved access and inflation pressures, and advocates emphasize the need for long-term, stable funding. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has allocated up to $150 million in contingency funds, but full-year funding remains uncertain, especially as both House and Senate proposals for the fiscal year 2026 budget differ in their support for WIC.",
