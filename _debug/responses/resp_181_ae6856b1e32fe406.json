  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China's Five Year Plans have been instrumental in shaping global economic and technological trends. Beginning with Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 reform and opening-up policy, China transitioned from state-led planning to a market-driven economy, triggering a massive shift in global manufacturing and the so-called 'China shock' in Western economies. By the early 2000s, China identified a need to escape the 'middle income trap' by investing in 'strategic emerging industries' such as electric vehicles and solar energy, which now make China the world leader in green technology and rare earth supply chains. With growing geopolitical tensions and U.S. restrictions on technology exports—especially semiconductors—China has pivoted toward 'high quality development' and 'new quality productive forces,' emphasizing domestic innovation, self-reliance, and technological independence in areas like AI and chip-making. This strategic shift, driven by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is central to China's economic policy and global ambitions through the 2026–2030 Five Year Plan, reflecting a long-term vision rooted in national security and technological sovereignty.",
