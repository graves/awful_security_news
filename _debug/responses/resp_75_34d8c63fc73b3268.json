  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 16, 2025, the US conducted a strike in the Caribbean on a suspected drug-laden boat, resulting in survivors — a first among previous strikes that were fatal. This action marks a shift in strategy, as it appears to be the first strike not to instantly kill all on board, and the first not publicly disclosed by the administration. The Trump administration has issued a classified legal opinion authorizing lethal strikes against drug traffickers, potentially allowing them to be designated as enemy combatants without due process, which contradicts traditional criminal justice norms. President Donald Trump also authorized CIA operations in Venezuela to disrupt drug and migrant flows, though he did not claim authority to remove President Nicolás Maduro. The incident raises concerns about the expansion of executive power in military and foreign operations and the implications for international law and human rights.",
