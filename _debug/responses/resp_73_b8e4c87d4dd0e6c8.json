According to the National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report, the plane, a Cirrus SR22T, entered a 'tightening spiral' after James failed to change his radio frequency from the common traffic advisory frequency, despite being instructed to do so. Air traffic control had approved a visual approach to runway 7, but communication was lost when James continued to announce his position at 6,800 feet and a 360-degree turn without tuning to the proper frequency. The NTSB found no mechanical issues with the aircraft, indicating that the crash was likely due to pilot error or miscommunication. The incident underscores the critical importance of maintaining proper radio communication in aviation operations.",
