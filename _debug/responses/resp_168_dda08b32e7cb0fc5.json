  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon pricing system aimed at reducing shipping emissions, by at least 12 months due to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on countries supporting the measure. The framework, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was previously approved in April 2025. Despite broad support from countries like China, the EU, and Britain, opposition from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and shifts in votes from Argentina and Singapore contributed to the postponement. The decision has been criticized by climate leaders and the shipping industry as a setback to urgent climate action, especially given the increasing risks to shipping from climate change. The article highlights the tension between climate policy and fossil fuel interests, and the challenges of achieving global consensus on emissions regulation in the maritime sector.",
