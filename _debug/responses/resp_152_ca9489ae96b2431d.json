  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests have paralyzed the southern Tunisian city of Gabes, driven by anger over environmental and public health damage caused by the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents, supported by the powerful UGTT labor union, blame the plant—opened in 1972—for widespread gas poisoning, cancer, and marine ecosystem collapse. Despite a 2017 government promise to phase out the plant, authorities have instead increased production, calling phosphate a national economic pillar. Over 200 people have been hospitalized for respiratory distress, and activists describe the environment as poisoned, including local food. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination,' and the protests represent one of the most significant challenges to his leadership since 2021. Chinese companies have been brought in to manage emissions, but public trust remains low as demands for immediate plant shutdown grow stronger.",
