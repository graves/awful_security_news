  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge has ordered the Department of Defense to return books on race and gender to school libraries at military bases after students and families claimed their First Amendment rights were violated. The books, which covered topics such as racism, LGBTQ+ pride, and critical race theory, were removed under executive orders from President Trump and guidance from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, which banned instruction on gender ideology, DEI, and identity-based celebrations like Black History Month. Students reported being punished for protesting these changes and becoming fearful of discussing race and gender in classrooms. The judge ruled that the removals were not based on pedagogical concerns but stemmed from improper partisan motivation, and thus ordered the immediate return of all affected materials. The ACLU of Kentucky, Virginia, and nationally filed legal action to support the students, highlighting a broader tension between federal education policy and free speech rights.",
