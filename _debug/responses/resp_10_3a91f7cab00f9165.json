    "Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, employ tens of thousands of mostly female workers and are crucial to the country’s GDP, especially in apparel exports to the United States.",
    "Workers face brutal conditions including daily quotas, long hours (up to 15 hours), low wages (less than $500/month), wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats of violence or dismissal.",
    "Korean companies, such as KOA Modas and Sae-A Trading, dominate the Guatemalan textile industry, controlling nearly two-thirds of investments and operating factories that supply major U.S. brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren.",
    "U.S. brands do not have formal contracts with workers and are not legally liable for working conditions, relying instead on subcontractors who often fail to uphold labor standards.",
    "Workers' unions are rare (only 9% of factories allow them), and union activity is often met with threats, violence, or retaliation, such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal.",
    "A culture of fear prevails, with reports of verbal abuse, inappropriate touching, and systemic power imbalances between male managers and female workers.",
    "Labor inspectors are routinely blocked from entering factories, and union members are often laid off after complaints, showing a lack of enforcement and political will.",
    "The Guatemalan government under President Bernardo Arévalo has raised the minimum wage and pledged reforms, but enforcement remains weak due to resistance from factory owners and structural power imbalances.",
    "Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra face financial devastation when laid off, with no severance or pensions, and are often unable to find new employment due to stigma and lack of support.",
    "The future of these workers is uncertain due to U.S. import tariffs, which threaten supply chains and could lead to further economic hardship in Guatemala and other nations in the supply chain."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A CNN investigation reveals widespread labor exploitation in Guatemala’s maquila garment factories, where tens of thousands of mostly female workers endure long hours, low wages, sexual harassment, and threats of violence. Korean-owned companies dominate the industry and supply major U.S. brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, but without legal responsibility or accountability. Workers face systemic abuse, including wage theft, daily quotas, and unsafe working conditions. Union activity is met with violence, threats, and retaliation—such as the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Despite political reforms under President Bernardo Arévalo and efforts to raise the minimum wage, enforcement remains weak, with factory owners blocking inspectors and laying off union members. Workers like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra suffer severe financial and emotional consequences when laid off, with no pensions or severance. The article underscores a global supply chain failure where U.S. consumers benefit from cheap clothing while workers are left in economic and psychological despair, and where power dynamics and gender-based exploitation remain unaddressed.",
