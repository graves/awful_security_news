  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue to fund the WIC program during the government shutdown, preventing it from running out of money after just days. This decision follows the failure of Congress to pass a full-year spending bill for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1. The White House claims this is a creative solution to protect vulnerable pregnant women, new mothers, and young children, with WIC serving nearly 7 million people. However, experts and the National WIC Association raise concerns about the legality, transparency, and long-term sustainability of using unappropriated tariff funds. The move is politically charged, with House Speaker Mike Johnson criticizing Democrats for the shutdown and calling it ‘shameful.’ Despite bipartisan support for WIC, the lack of congressional authorization for spending raises legal questions, and advocates stress that long-term funding is needed to maintain access to essential nutrition programs amid rising inflation.",
