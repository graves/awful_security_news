  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call to action to address critical gaps in early-warning systems for extreme weather events, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capacity. With over 2 million deaths linked to weather, water, and climate hazards in the past 50 years—mostly in developing nations—the WMO stresses that early warnings are vital for saving lives and protecting infrastructure. Despite progress in early-warning systems, 50% of assessed countries still have only basic or less than basic systems, with the situation most dire in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. Real-world examples, such as the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten after a predicted glacier collapse in May 2025, illustrate how timely monitoring can prevent disaster. The article emphasizes that climate change is intensifying extreme weather, with countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, and parts of southern Europe and the US experiencing severe floods and wildfires in 2025, reinforcing the urgent need for global investment in early-warning technologies and systems.",
