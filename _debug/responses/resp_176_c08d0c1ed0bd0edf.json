    "The AWS outage in 2025 revealed significant global dependency on US tech firms, particularly Amazon Web Services (AWS), affecting critical services such as banking and government operations in the UK.",
    "The cloud computing market in the UK is dominated by AWS and Microsoft Azure, each holding 30–40% of the market, according to the CMA, creating concentrated risk and systemic fragility.",
    "The outage exposed 'nested dependency' — where even non-hosted services rely on the underlying infrastructure of major cloud providers, meaning a single failure can cascade across multiple sectors.",
    "Experts argue that while relying on tech giants offers cost efficiency, scalability, and security, it also creates high vulnerability and political risk, especially in times of global conflict.",
    "There is growing concern about the lack of competition and national sovereignty in cloud infrastructure, leading to calls for UK government action to mandate data resilience and diversification across cloud providers.",
    "The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to enable regulatory oversight and promote competition.",
    "Proposals include mandating the use of two or more cloud providers and continuous data replication to improve resilience and reduce reliance on a single provider.",
    "Political leadership, such as Lord Leong, has acknowledged the need to diversify the UK’s cloud ecosystem and encourage participation from UK and European providers."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage in 2025 disrupted critical UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns over over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. With AWS and Azure each holding 30–40% of the UK cloud market, the incident exposed deep 'nested dependencies' where even non-hosted services are vulnerable to outages. Experts warn that this concentration creates systemic risks, including economic and geopolitical vulnerabilities. While using major cloud providers offers cost and scalability benefits, the lack of competition and national sovereignty has prompted calls for regulatory action. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as 'strategic market status' providers to enforce competition. Experts and policymakers argue that the UK should mandate the use of multiple cloud providers and implement data resilience standards to improve digital resilience and support local innovation.",
