  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, specifically citing two studies — one from 2013 and another from 2015 — and a 2025 preprint by WPLab, which has not been peer-reviewed. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, argue that neither study establishes causation, both suffer from small sample sizes and flawed methodology, and neither includes data on acetaminophen use. The 2013 study found only a weak correlation between circumcision and autism rates, which the authors explicitly labeled as not causal. The 2015 Danish study showed a small increase in autism risk among circumcised boys but was limited by small numbers and incomplete data. The WPLab preprint makes unsupported causal claims about acetaminophen triggering autism, which contradicts decades of scientific consensus on the drug’s safety. The article highlights the danger of misrepresenting or selectively citing research to promote unsubstantiated public health claims, especially when such claims are made by high-profile figures with potential influence over public perception.",
