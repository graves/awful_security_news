  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Admiral Alvin Holsey, who became commander of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024, is retiring at the end of 2025, one year into his tenure. His departure follows months of reported tensions with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the pace and legality of counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean. The retirement comes amid a surge in U.S. military activity, including a fifth known strike on a drug-trafficking boat off Venezuela’s coast in October 2025, and President Donald Trump’s public authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela to curb drug and migrant flows. While Holsey expressed concerns about legal compliance and operational transparency, the Pentagon denies claims that he objected to the missions. Holsey, a 37-year Navy veteran with extensive command experience, is being succeeded by a new leadership structure under Hegseth, who has already replaced several senior military officials. The situation highlights growing friction between military operational goals and legal accountability in U.S. foreign intervention efforts.",
