  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Missouri's newly gerrymandered congressional map, passed by a Republican-dominated legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Kehoe, is under legal and public challenge. The map targets the seat of long-serving Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver II in Kansas City. In response, the grassroots group People Not Politicians Missouri, led by Leann Villaluz, has mobilized over 100,000 residents to collect signatures for a 2026 referendum that would allow voters to decide whether to keep or reject the map. The campaign is met with resistance from state officials, including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who argue the process violates constitutional law. Internal divisions exist within the Republican Party, with 15 lawmakers, including Speaker Jon Patterson and representative Bill Allen, opposing the map due to concerns over district representation. Progressive candidate Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan, who is running for Kansas City Council, also opposes the map, citing concerns about diluted voting power and worsening local challenges. The Democratic National Committee has joined the effort, providing support. The article underscores growing public resistance to mid-decade redistricting, especially in states like Missouri that are seen as political test cases for GOP gerrymandering tactics.",
