  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for an immediate summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been abandoned, with no current plans for a meeting in the near term. The administration cites a lack of progress from Russian officials, particularly Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is seen as loyal to Putin and not involved in key decision-making. A previous call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Lavrov was described as productive but failed to advance concrete steps, leading to the suspension of the summit timeline. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia’s reduced interest in diplomacy stems from the U.S. refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, suggesting that such capabilities are essential to peace. Despite the setback, the Trump administration maintains its commitment to brokering peace in Ukraine. Future diplomatic discussions between Rubio and Lavrov may occur at an ASEAN-led international gathering in Malaysia, though no definitive plans exist. The Kremlin maintains that no summit date has been set, so it cannot be postponed.",
