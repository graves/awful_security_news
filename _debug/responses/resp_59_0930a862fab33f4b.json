  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legality of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which was made through delegation by the Attorney General rather than Senate confirmation. The Department of Justice argues that such delegation is a recognized and constitutionally valid practice, citing precedents from the Biden administration and other federal appointments. Critics, including legal counsel Abbe Lowell, claim that delegating full US attorney powers—such as overseeing investigations and managing personnel—is unprecedented and unlawful, asserting that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act requires Senate-confirmed individuals. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges underway in Nevada and California, and is tied to political and legal controversies involving former White House aides and FBI Director James Comey. Habba attributes the delay in appointing a confirmed attorney to congressional obstruction and emphasizes the need for the executive branch to carry out its mandate without political interference.",
