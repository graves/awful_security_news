  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with possible flash flooding and mudslides due to over a foot of rainfall. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the mainland U.S. is unlikely, the East Coast could face rough seas and rip currents, and Florida may be affected if the storm shifts northward. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season and marks the first formation in the Caribbean Sea, fueled by extremely warm sea temperatures linked to climate change. The storm’s intensification aligns with a broader trend of rapid strengthening in recent hurricanes, such as Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto, highlighting growing impacts of global warming on tropical weather systems.",
