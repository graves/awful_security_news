  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months, following a public threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was initially approved in April 2025 but now faces a significant setback due to political pressure. Countries such as China, the EU, Brazil, and Britain had previously backed the plan, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore voted to postpone it. The decision has been criticized by environmental leaders, shipping industry representatives, and climate vulnerable nations like Vanuatu, who argue it undermines urgent efforts to combat climate change. The delay reflects broader U.S. policy reversal on climate change, with Trump promoting fossil fuels and deregulating clean energy. The IMO, responsible for regulating international shipping and pollution, now faces a pivotal moment in global climate governance.",
