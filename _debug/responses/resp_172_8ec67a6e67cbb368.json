  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage on 2025-10-21 disrupted critical services across the UK, including banks and government agencies, reigniting global concerns over over-reliance on a few US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. The incident exposed 'nested dependencies' in digital infrastructure, where even services not directly hosted on AWS rely on its underlying systems. Experts, including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), warn of systemic risks from market concentration, with AWS and Microsoft each holding 30–40% of the UK cloud market. While US dominance offers economies of scale and security, it also creates vulnerability to geopolitical and technical disruptions. Experts and policymakers are calling for increased competition, diversification of cloud providers, and government-mandated resilience standards—such as requiring multiple cloud providers and continuous data replication—to build a more sovereign, resilient, and open digital ecosystem.",
