  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food deliveries to Gaza are critically insufficient, with only 750 tonnes reaching the territory—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two of the Israeli-controlled crossings being open. The WFP stresses that all border crossings must be fully utilized to meet food needs, particularly in northern Gaza. While humanitarian aid has expanded to 26 distribution points, this remains far below the planned 145. The Rafah crossing remains closed, and access is conditional on Hamas delivering the bodies of deceased captives. The US-brokered ceasefire is seen as vital to preventing famine, and the WFP warns that current food supplies are only sufficient for half a million people for two weeks, with residents storing food due to fears of renewed conflict.",
