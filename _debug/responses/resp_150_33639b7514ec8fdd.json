  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing two studies — a 2013 cross-country analysis and a 2015 Danish study — which both failed to establish causation. Experts, including Helen Tager-Flusberg, clarify that neither study proves a causal relationship, both have significant limitations including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use, and both explicitly state that correlation does not imply causation. A 2025 preprint from WPLab, a company promoting a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, has not been peer-reviewed and misrepresents the findings of the earlier studies. The claim that acetaminophen causes autism is not supported by decades of scientific research, and experts affirm its safety when used as directed. The article highlights concerns about misinformation, especially due to connections between Kennedy and WPLab CEO William Parker, and underscores the importance of evidence-based science in public health communications.",
