  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, targeting both essential services and civilian lives to inflict terror and prolong suffering. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded by urging European allies to provide urgent military and financial support, including the use of frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—as a potential funding source for critical air defense systems like the Patriot battery. Despite the EU’s proposal of a €140 billion loan, the Kremlin disputes the legality of such asset use. Analysts note a pattern where U.S. diplomatic shifts toward Russia trigger increased Russian aggression. Ukraine remains committed to peace, with Zelensky emphasizing that any ceasefire must begin with a clear line of contact, while also expressing deep concern over a possible summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close ally of Putin.",
