  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Oklahoma’s new superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a mandate introduced by former Superintendent Ryan Walters that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and incorporated into school curricula. The policy, which was criticized by civil rights groups and led to a pending lawsuit in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, was met with resistance from many school districts. Fields emphasized that classroom religious instruction is a matter of local discretion and that taxpayer funds should not be spent on Bibles. The state education department also plans to review and potentially rescind other controversial mandates from Walters’ tenure, including an ideology exam for teachers from California and New York. This action reflects a broader political shift in Oklahoma’s education policy away from religious instruction and toward greater local autonomy and legal compliance with secular education standards.",
