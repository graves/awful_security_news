  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A brazen robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning involved four men who broke into the Galerie d'Apollon using a basket lift on a truck to access a second-floor window. Armed with chainsaws and box cutters, they smashed display cases and fled on Yamaha TMax scooters, reportedly abandoning two valuable items — including the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie — near the museum. French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez described the heist as a highly organized and swift operation lasting only seven minutes, with all central police units mobilized in response. The incident follows a recent trend of museum thefts in France, including a $700,000 gold heist at the National Museum of Natural History and an $11 million porcelain theft from the Adrien Dubouché National Museum in Limoges. The Louvre, renowned for its cultural and historical treasures, remains closed to preserve evidence.",
