  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A 38-year-old man named Nicholas Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was sentenced to five years to life in prison in Utah after being convicted of first-degree rape in two separate incidents in 2008. Rossi allegedly faked his death in 2020 by claiming he died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which led to a decade-long evasion of justice. He used multiple aliases, including claiming to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, and was arrested in Scotland in 2024 after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice. Authorities identified him through a decade-old DNA rape kit, part of Utah's effort to clear its rape kit backlog. The victims, both women, testified about financial manipulation and abuse before the crimes. Prosecutors described Rossi as a dangerous flight risk and serial abuser, while he maintained his innocence during sentencing. He is scheduled for a second sentencing in November, following a prior conviction in September.",
