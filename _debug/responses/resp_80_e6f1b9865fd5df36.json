  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The widespread cultural revival of cowboy imagery in 2025—seen in fashion, media, politics, and entertainment—is driven by a deep-seated American myth linking cowboys to patriotism, rugged individualism, and traditional values. While historically rooted in romanticized Western films and 19th-century theatrical shows like the Buffalo Bill Wild West, the modern cowboy image is now a political and cultural tool, especially within conservative movements and under the influence of leaders like Donald Trump. Despite efforts by artists like Richard Avedon and Gabriela Hasbun to reveal the real, diverse, and often impoverished history of cowboys—including Mexican, Native American, and Black Americans—the mainstream narrative continues to rely on sanitized, white-centric tropes. The resurgence is also tied to social movements such as the Black Lives Matter protests, which brought attention to Black urban cowboy communities. However, this visibility is often followed by a 'whitewashing' of the narrative, where the true diversity of cowboy culture is downplayed. The article argues that the current cowboy trend reflects not just aesthetic preference, but a broader cultural and political shift toward conservatism, resistance to urban liberalism, and a nostalgia for an idealized, masculine, and patriotic America.",
