  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has publicly urged vaccination in response to growing political misinformation and policy shifts at the federal level. They criticize the CDC and U.S. government officials—including former President Donald Trump—for spreading false claims about vaccine safety, such as false claims about vaccine dosages and the MMRV vaccine's use for young children. The coalition highlights a recent CDC advisory against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4, which may reduce access and increase disease risk. A measles outbreak in South Carolina, affecting over 100 students in school, demonstrates the real-world dangers of low vaccination rates. Public trust in the CDC has plummeted, with only half of Americans currently trusting it with vaccine information. Local officials stress the need for science-based, data-driven public health decisions and emphasize that public health is not confined by geographic boundaries, requiring strong cross-jurisdictional collaboration to protect communities.",
