  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "La Liga has canceled plans for a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal to be played in Miami in December 2025, reversing a significant step in the league’s international expansion.

Despite prior approvals from UEFA and the Spanish federation, and support from Barcelona and Villarreal, the league cited uncertainty and insufficient time to properly execute the event. The cancellation is seen as a setback for global growth, revenue generation, and international visibility of Spanish soccer, especially in a competitive global market. The event had been promoted by Relevent Sports, part of Stephen Ross's portfolio, and was tied to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The league expressed regret over the decision and reaffirmed its commitment to expanding Spanish soccer worldwide.",
