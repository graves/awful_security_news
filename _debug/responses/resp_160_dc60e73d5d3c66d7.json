  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Belize, a move by the Trump administration to reduce asylum applications and expand deportation efforts. The deal, while framed as consistent with international law and humanitarian principles, faces strong domestic and international criticism, particularly over Belize’s capacity to provide adequate protections and the risks of deporting asylum seekers to countries with poor human rights records, such as South Sudan or El Salvador. Critics argue that such agreements may violate international refugee law and allow wealthy nations to evade legal obligations. Belize claims it has safeguards including nationality restrictions, a transfer cap, and security vetting, but opposition leaders and human rights advocates challenge these claims, warning that the country is being used as a 'dumping ground' and lacks the infrastructure to meet human rights standards. The agreement still requires Senate approval and is part of a broader U.S. strategy that has included similar deals with countries like Guatemala, Eswatini, and Rwanda, though recent cases have shown inconsistent outcomes and potential violations of asylum rights.",
