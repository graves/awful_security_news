  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a rapid second summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have been delayed after a planned pre-meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was tabled. The meeting was postponed due to disagreements over the scope of ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Rubio expressing skepticism about Russia’s willingness to make meaningful concessions. Despite Trump’s ongoing public calls for an immediate end to the war and a diplomatic resolution, the lack of progress in bilateral talks—particularly on concrete steps to end hostilities—has raised doubts about whether the Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, Hungary, will move forward in the near term. The situation underscores the difficulty in achieving diplomatic breakthroughs amid entrenched positions on the war in Ukraine.",
