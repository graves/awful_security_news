  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire in Doha, Qatar, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, following over a week of deadly border clashes that began on October 10, 2025. The violence, which saw at least 30 civilians killed and hundreds injured according to UNAMA, stemmed from accusations each side made of the other conducting airstrikes—Afghanistan accusing Pakistan of attacks on Kabul and Paktika, and Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of harboring the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). The ceasefire includes mutual commitments to refrain from targeting civilians, security forces, or critical infrastructure, with both sides agreeing to work toward lasting peace. However, tensions remain high, as Pakistan denies targeting civilians in attacks on militant camps, while Afghanistan's cricket board reported the killing of eight people—including three players—during a gathering in Paktika, prompting Afghanistan’s withdrawal from a T20I cricket tournament with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This escalation marks the worst conflict between the two nations since the U.S. withdrawal in 2021 and raises serious concerns about regional stability.",
