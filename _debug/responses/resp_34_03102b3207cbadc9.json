    "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, claims in her posthumous memoir that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister' — referred to as a 'former minister' in the UK version — and that the abuse included choking, beating, and fear of death as a sex slave.",
    "The memoir, titled 'Nobody’s Girl,' was published six months after Giuffre's death by suicide in Australia, and details her years of trauma and efforts to seek justice.",
    "In the US version of the memoir, the accused is described as a 'well-known Prime Minister,' while in the UK version, the man is described as a 'former minister,' creating a discrepancy that remains unexplained.",
    "The allegations specifically target Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles, who is accused of sexually assaulting Giuffre when she was 17, and of having a continuing relationship with Epstein after publicly claiming to have severed ties.",
    "Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle a civil case brought by Giuffre in 2022, and she claims his team attempted to hire online trolls to discredit her and undermine her credibility.",
    "Newly unearthed emails show that in February 2011, Andrew wrote to Epstein saying they were 'in this together' and would 'play some more soon,' contradicting his earlier claim that he broke off contact with Epstein in 2010.",
    "The revelations deepen the existing transatlantic scandal involving powerful figures and Epstein’s trafficking ring, and raise serious questions about accountability, cover-ups, and the influence of elite networks.",
    "Buckingham Palace has not formally responded to the new allegations, but Andrew has publicly stepped down from using his title 'Duke of York' and will retain only the title 'Prince,' stating he prioritizes family and country duty."
