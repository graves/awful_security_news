Consumers and businesses are facing rising prices due to cost inflation, with companies like RH and IKEA already warning of financial consequences. Experts warn that despite not being a complete collapse of the housing market, these tariffs add cumulative strain, especially in an already weak sector. The tariffs, introduced under President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration, are expected to continue ramping up in January, and will likely push up housing prices, reduce affordability, and discourage investment in affordable housing projects. While the White House argues these measures support domestic manufacturing and national security, economists and industry leaders emphasize that the impact is detrimental to housing affordability and market stability.",
