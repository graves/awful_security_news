  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Six prominent U.S. universities — including the University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and Dartmouth College — have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for adopting ideological policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, and defining gender based on biological processes. The proposal, which originated on October 1, 2025, was designed to create a 'compact' for universities to align with conservative policy ideals in exchange for preferential funding and access to White House events. The rejections were grounded in strong concerns about the erosion of academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and free inquiry. Leaders across institutions emphasized that federal funding should be awarded based on academic merit, not political alignment. While some schools like the University of Texas at Austin have expressed openness to dialogue, others, including Vanderbilt and the University of Arizona, are still reviewing the proposal. The Trump administration has intensified lobbying efforts, with targeted universities increasing spending significantly. California Governor Gavin Newsom has also threatened state-level funding cuts to schools that comply, indicating a broader political and legislative pushback against federal control of higher education.",
