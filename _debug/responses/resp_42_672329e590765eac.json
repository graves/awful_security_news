  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Utah judge sentenced Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man who allegedly faked his death in 2020 to evade arrest on rape charges, to a prison term of five years to life. Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was identified in 2018 through a DNA match from a decade-old rape kit, and was found to have used multiple aliases, including claiming to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. After an online obituary falsely claimed his death, he was arrested in Scotland in 2024 by hospital staff who recognized his distinctive tattoos, including one from Brown University. He was extradited to Utah and convicted in two separate trials for raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. The victim testified about the predatory nature of the relationship, including financial exploitation and rape. Despite claiming innocence, the jury found him guilty. Rossi is considered a flight risk and serial abuser, and the case highlights the importance of DNA evidence and the dangers of false death claims by perpetrators.",
