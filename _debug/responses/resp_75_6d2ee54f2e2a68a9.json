  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered XA-JMR and Mexican-registered, crashed during a test flight near Lansing, Michigan on October 17, 2025, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative. The plane departed Battle Creek Executive Airport at 5:08 p.m. and climbed to 15,000 feet before experiencing a sudden and catastrophic descent, reaching a rate of 24,000 feet per minute in under a minute. Air traffic control audio captures pilots repeatedly requesting stall recovery, and the controllers attempted to reach them seven times without success. Duncan Aviation, which conducted the maintenance and operated the flight, has opened a support channel for affected families. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation, citing a prior similar crash in February 2024 involving a Hawker 800XP during a stall test flight. The aircraft had not flown since March 25, 2025, raising concerns about system reliability and maintenance integrity.",
