  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A United Airlines Boeing 737 flight (Flight 1093) traveling from Denver to Los Angeles experienced a cockpit window crack that injured a pilot, prompting an emergency landing in Salt Lake City. The company identified a weather balloon from startup WindBorne as a likely cause. WindBorne has responded by implementing operational changes to reduce exposure during key altitudes (30,000–40,000 feet), accelerating development of autonomous flight avoidance systems, and improving balloon design to reduce impact force. The incident has prompted cooperation between WindBorne and the NTSB and FAA, with all passengers and crew unharmed. The aircraft later flew to Rockford, Illinois, for maintenance, underscoring the broader implications for aviation safety and technology integration.",
