  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, accusing Speaker Mike Johnson of violating constitutional principles by refusing to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva. Johnson claims he is following the precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi during recess periods, arguing that the House should not hold regular sessions during breaks. However, the lawsuit asserts that the Constitution requires newly elected members to be sworn in upon meeting qualifications, and that no authority exists for the Speaker to unilaterally delay this process. The case alleges that Johnson's delay is politically motivated, aimed at advancing a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations. Grijalva, who won her election in late September 2025, has not spoken to Johnson and is seeking a personal meeting to resolve the impasse. The lawsuit seeks a court order allowing a qualified official to administer the oath, as Johnson has not provided any legitimate reason for delay, and claims that the delay harms both Grijalva’s ability to serve and the interests of Arizona constituents.",
