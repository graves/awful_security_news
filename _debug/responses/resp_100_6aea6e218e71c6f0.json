  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, thousands of protesters across the United States participated in the second major wave of 'No Kings' rallies, a movement that criticizes President Donald Trump’s leadership style as monarchical and authoritarian. The protests, occurring in over 2,600 locations and drawing an estimated 5 million participants in June, target Trump’s policies including immigration detentions, education cuts, environmental rollbacks, and gerrymandering. Demonstrators used symbols of unity, such as yellow and butterflies, and emphasized loyalty to the Constitution over political figures. The events were largely peaceful, with no major arrests reported in major cities like New York and Washington, D.C. Political figures including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mayor Brandon Johnson, and state governors Glenn Youngkin and Greg Abbott responded to the protests—some with support, others with hostility—highlighting deep political divisions. The movement reflects a broad, cross-partisan public resistance to what many view as unchecked presidential power, with veterans, immigrants, and ordinary citizens uniting to defend democratic values.",
