  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan has withdrawn from an upcoming T20 cricket series following the tragic killing of three local cricketers—Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah, and Haroon—in an air strike on the border with Pakistan. The attack, which also killed eight civilians, reportedly targeted a home in Urgon district, Paktika province, where the players were dining after a match. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) condemned the strike, attributing it to the Pakistani regime, while Pakistan denied targeting civilians, claiming it was a military operation against militants. The International Cricket Council (ICC) expressed deep sorrow and condemned the violence, standing in solidarity with Afghanistan. The incident occurred amid a fragile 48-hour truce between the two nations, which has since been extended to allow peace talks in Doha, Qatar. The Taliban government affirmed its participation in negotiations despite accusing Pakistan of aggression. In response to the tragedy, Zimbabwe has been invited to replace Afghanistan in the cricket series, illustrating how a regional security crisis directly impacts international sports diplomacy.",
