    "Trump has announced plans to build a new $250 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, marking the first structural change since 1948.",
    "The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and historically used for first lady offices and diplomatic visits, is being reconstructed, though the main White House building will not be touched.",
    "The new ballroom will cover approximately 90,000 square feet (8,360 m²), with a seating capacity of around 650 guests (some reports suggest up to 999), significantly larger than the current East Room’s 200-seat capacity.",
    "The project began without formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which is currently closed due to a government shutdown, raising questions about procedural compliance and oversight.",
    "Trump claims the project will be funded entirely by himself and private donors, with no cost to taxpayers, though no specific donors have been disclosed.",
    "The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction (Virginia) and engineering by AECOM (Dallas).",
    "The ballroom is intended to host state dinners and large-scale events, addressing a long-standing complaint that previous U.S. presidents have lacked a dedicated space for such gatherings.",
    "The East Wing sits directly above an underground emergency bunker, raising structural and safety concerns given the scale of the renovation.",
    "The White House has undergone numerous structural changes since its construction in 1800, including fires, expansions, and redesigns under various presidents, making this project historically significant as one of the largest changes in decades."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has initiated a major renovation of the White House’s East Wing, announcing plans to build a new $250 million ballroom that will serve as a space for large-scale state events and diplomatic gatherings. The project, first announced in July 2025, began with demolition this week and marks the first structural change to the White House since 1948. Despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission due to a government shutdown, the project proceeds under Trump’s claim that it will be fully privately funded with no cost to taxpayers. The new ballroom, estimated at 90,000 square feet and capable of seating up to 999 guests, will be constructed adjacent to but not touching the main White House structure, with offices temporarily relocated during the renovation. The project is being led by McCrery Architects, with construction by Clark Construction and engineering by AECOM. Critics have raised concerns about structural safety—particularly given the East Wing’s location directly above a presidential emergency bunker—and procedural compliance with federal regulations. Historically, the East Wing has served as a first lady office and diplomatic visitor space since 1977, making this transformation both politically and historically significant.",
