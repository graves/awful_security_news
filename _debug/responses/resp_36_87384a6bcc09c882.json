  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally relinquished his royal titles, including Duke of York, after enduring a prolonged period of public and legal scrutiny stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct with Jeffrey Epstein and ties to an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo. The decision, which took effect immediately upon discussion with King Charles and other members of the royal family, reflects growing pressure from public opinion and legal proceedings, particularly following Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit and her subsequent death. While Andrew denies all allegations, the actions by the royal family—such as removing him from royal events and stripping him of public roles—signal a significant shift in the monarchy’s response to misconduct. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will now be known only as Sarah Ferguson, and his daughters retain their titles. Andrew will remain a 'Prince' by lineage but will no longer use his dukedom, continuing to reside at Royal Lodge.",
