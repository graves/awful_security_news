Art experts, including Arthur Brand, described the theft as a 'national disaster' due to the items’ irreplaceable historical and symbolic significance. Many of the stolen pieces have deep royal and familial ties, with origins tracing back to Marie Antoinette, the Orléans family, and earlier French monarchy. Some pieces were previously sold or altered (e.g., the tiara now in the Smithsonian), while others were acquired by the Louvre in recent decades. The incident highlights vulnerabilities in museum security and raises concerns about the potential dismantling and sale of these treasured artifacts.",
