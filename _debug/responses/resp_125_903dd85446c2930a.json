  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolition of part of the East Wing—traditionally used by the first lady—without approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Despite claims of private funding and no taxpayer cost, the project bypasses established federal oversight, raises concerns over historical preservation and regulatory compliance, and includes a significant corporate donation from Carrier Global Corp. for HVAC systems. The construction, which began in September and is expected to be completed by January 2029, has drawn public scrutiny due to its scale, lack of formal approval, and potential disruption to existing operations, including first lady offices. President Donald Trump has repeatedly justified the project as a long-desired, modernization effort, emphasizing the need for a large indoor space to host dignitaries, contrasting with traditional South Lawn pavilions.",
