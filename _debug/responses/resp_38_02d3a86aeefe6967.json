  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major heist occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris on October 20, 2025, when thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery through a window and stole high-value royal jewelry, including a diadem from Queen Marie-Amélie and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding gift to Marie-Louise. The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, with the robbers leaving on scooters along the Seine. Experts, including French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and senators like Natalie Goulet, believe the items have likely been taken abroad and sold on the black market or melted down for money, indicating a possible link to organized crime. The incident has exposed serious security flaws, such as unsecured windows and public access to high-risk equipment. The theft is seen as a profound cultural and national blow, drawing comparisons to past heists like the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 disappearance of a Camille Corot painting. Experts warn that many of the stolen pieces may never be recovered or restored to their original form, and the article underscores the urgent need for improved museum security and international cooperation to protect cultural heritage.",
