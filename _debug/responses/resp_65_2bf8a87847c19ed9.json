  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to represent James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017 during the aftermath of his firing by President Trump. Fitzgerald denies the claims, asserting that the memos shared with him were unclassified at the time and that the government’s later upclassification does not negate that fact. Prosecutors cite 'quarantined evidence' of communications between Comey and Fitzgerald, while Fitzgerald points to an inspector general's report finding no evidence of classified disclosures. Legal experts caution that a person cannot serve as both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case, raising ethical concerns about Fitzgerald’s role. The dispute centers on whether the sharing of unclassified memos constitutes a breach of ethics or a violation of national security protocols, highlighting tensions between political accountability and legal representation.",
