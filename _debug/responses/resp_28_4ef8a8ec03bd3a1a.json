  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a new immediate ceasefire after more than a week of deadly clashes along their disputed 1,600-mile border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The violence, which began on October 10, stemmed from accusations from Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership that Pakistan conducted airstrikes on Afghan civilian areas in Paktika, leading to retaliatory attacks. Pakistan denied targeting civilians, claiming its operations were directed at verified militant camps, particularly those of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). The Taliban and Pakistan agreed to stop targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, and critical infrastructure, with both sides committing to work toward lasting peace. The conflict, the deadliest escalation between the two nations since 2021, has resulted in dozens of civilian deaths and hundreds of injuries, with the UN reporting significant humanitarian damage. The situation has also disrupted cultural activities, including Afghanistan’s withdrawal from a T20I cricket tournament with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The agreement reflects ongoing regional tensions, with Pakistan viewing Afghanistan as a safe haven for militants and Afghanistan accusing Pakistan of violating ceasefire terms.",
