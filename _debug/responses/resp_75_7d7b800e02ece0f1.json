  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Big Cities Health Coalition, comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities, has publicly urged vaccination in response to growing political misinformation and declining public trust in federal health agencies. The coalition criticizes the CDC and federal officials—including former President Donald Trump—for making false claims about vaccine safety and making changes to childhood immunization schedules, such as removing the MMRV vaccine for children under 4. These actions have contributed to a drop in vaccination rates, leading to outbreaks like measles in South Carolina and a sharp decline in public trust in the CDC, with only half of Americans now trusting it. Local health officials emphasize that public health is a shared responsibility across jurisdictions and stress the need for science-based, data-driven communication to protect communities. Meanwhile, major medical organizations like the AAP and ACOG have distanced themselves from CDC guidance, highlighting a deepening divide in public health policy.",
