  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a globally influential music mogul, has been convicted of two counts of transporting individuals to engage in prostitution and sentenced to 50 months in prison. While acquitted on more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, the conviction centers on allegations that he exploited his power to coerce women—particularly through 'freak-offs' involving his girlfriend Cassandra Ventura and another woman, Jane—into participating in sexual encounters. The judge, Arun Subramanian, emphasized accountability for abuse of women, imposing a $500,000 fine and five years of probation. Combs expressed remorse, apologized to the women involved, and requested mercy, but his legal team has now announced plans to appeal both the conviction and the sentence, reflecting ongoing public and legal scrutiny of power dynamics, consent, and accountability in celebrity culture.",
