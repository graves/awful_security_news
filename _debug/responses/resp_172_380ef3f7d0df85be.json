    "The 2025 Nobel Prizes began with the awarding of the Physiology or Medicine Prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by Alfred Nobel’s will to recognize individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "The prize categories are awarded by specific institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for physics, chemistry, and economics; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet for medicine; the Swedish Academy for literature; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee for peace.",
    "Each laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million), managed by the Nobel Foundation.",
    "The nomination process is confidential, with experts, past winners, and academics invited to submit nominations by January 31, and nominations remain secret for 50 years.",
    "The Peace Prize has drawn significant attention this year due to claims by U.S. President Donald Trump about deserving the award for ending wars, although experts argue that such claims are inconsistent with the Nobel Committee’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts.",
    "The Trump administration has been criticized for threatening academic freedom, with officials like Ylva Engstrom of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences warning that political interference undermines the integrity of scientific research.",
    "The 2024 winners provide context: Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for microRNA discovery; John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational work in machine learning; David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for breakthroughs in protein structure prediction; Han Kang for literature exploring violence and memory; Nihon Hidankyo for anti-nuclear advocacy; and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for institutional analysis of economic growth and inequality."
