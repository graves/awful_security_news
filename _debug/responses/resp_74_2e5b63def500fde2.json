  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombians are expressing widespread concern over a growing diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, triggered by Trump’s accusations that Petro is a 'drug trafficker,' which Petro dismissed as 'rude and ignorant.' The conflict threatens to disrupt Colombia’s economy, as the US is its largest trading partner and provides vital aid for drug eradication. A potential tariff increase or cut in US assistance could severely impact Colombian exports, including coffee, flowers, gold, and manufactured goods, leading to job losses and financial instability. Citizens across social classes—housewives, taxi drivers, students, and retirees—express fear about economic and personal consequences, including visa access and public safety. The feud underscores a broader issue: while leaders engage in personal attacks, the underlying challenges of drug trafficking and regional security remain unresolved.",
