  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been without off-site power for four weeks—the longest outage since the war began—forcing emergency diesel generator use. Work to restore power is now underway, following the establishment of rare local ceasefire zones, with both the International Atomic Energy Agency and warring parties acknowledging the importance of safe restoration. The IAEA emphasized that off-site power is essential for nuclear safety. Ukraine blames Russia for intentionally cutting power to test reconnection, while Russia attributes the blackout to Ukrainian shelling. Additionally, a recent Russian strike on a substation in Slavutych caused a blackout at the former Chernobyl plant, raising concerns about broader regional nuclear risks. The situation highlights the ongoing threat to nuclear safety in conflict zones due to military aggression and the occupation of critical infrastructure.",
