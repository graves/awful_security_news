  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and furniture have significantly increased construction and renovation costs, placing further strain on an already struggling housing market. Homeowners like Anthony Cabrera have seen budgets balloon from $300,000 to $450,000 due to rising material prices, while companies such as RH and IKEA face increased costs and potential price hikes. Experts from Goldman Sachs, Georgetown Law, and industry groups warn that these tariffs, building on previous steel and copper levies, will push up consumer prices, with up to 55% of costs borne by households. Though not a full collapse, the cumulative effect of tariffs adds to high mortgage rates and construction cost pressures, threatening affordability and innovation in low-margin housing projects. Businesses like Stillfried Design and Colony reflect broader industry uncertainty, with rising input costs leading to higher prices and reduced consumer spending. The tariffs are expected to ramp up in January, deepening economic uncertainty for home buyers and builders.",
