  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change will add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 under current emissions pathways—half the increase from the pre-Paris 4°C warming scenario. While the Paris Agreement has reduced warming projections from 4°C to 2.6°C, the impacts remain severe, with vulnerable small island nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa facing massive spikes in dangerous heat days (up to 149 extra days per year), despite contributing negligibly to global emissions. In contrast, major polluters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 additional superhot days. Experts warn that this stark disparity exacerbates global inequities and may contribute to future geopolitical tensions, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected annually by rising extreme heat.",
