  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing two studies — a 2013 and a 2015 study — that show a correlation. However, experts say both studies are flawed, with small sample sizes, lack of data on acetaminophen use, and failure to establish causation. The 2025 preprint from WPLab, which Kennedy cited, has not been peer-reviewed and claims acetaminophen triggers autism, a claim unsupported by scientific consensus. The studies were criticized by researchers like Helen Tager-Flusberg for misrepresenting findings and ignoring confounding variables. Decades of medical research confirm that acetaminophen is safe for infants and no link to autism exists. The article highlights concerns about the spread of unverified medical claims, especially when influenced by entities with a known bias, such as WPLab and individuals with close ties to political figures.",
