  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products that would warn of a possible link between use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggesting such a link, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children and a review of 46 studies—shows no clear or causal connection. The FDA maintains that no adverse outcomes have been proven, and its website continues to state there is no clear evidence of harm. Regulatory agencies in the EU, UK, and Canada confirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that label changes are arbitrary, unsupported by science, and contrary to FDA policy, and it has formally requested that the FDA deny the citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network.",
