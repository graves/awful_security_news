The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and other members of the royal family, comes after Virginia Giuffre’s 2015 sexual abuse lawsuit, which alleged that Andrew was aware of and participated in Epstein’s trafficking of minors and engaged in illicit activities with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Despite repeatedly denying the allegations, Andrew has faced significant reputational damage, with his titles and public roles stripped over the years. A 2024 tribunal revealed that Yang Tengbo, a Chinese-linked businessman, was authorized to represent Andrew in business dealings with UK investors, raising national security concerns. The prince will no longer attend royal events such as Christmas celebrations but will continue to live at Royal Lodge and retain his title as 'Prince' due to being the son of Queen Elizabeth II. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson will now be known only as Sarah Ferguson, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, retain their titles. The case has gained renewed attention with the release of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, described as 'unsparing,' which may further validate her claims.",
