  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and significant coaching decisions. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit against the New York Giants, with second-year quarterback Bo Nix delivering a sensational fourth-quarter performance that broke a 161-0 NFL record. In another standout moment, New England Patriots' Drake Maye surpassed Tom Brady's franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to achieve 90% completion, over 200 yards passing, and over 50 yards rushing in a single game. Meanwhile, poor performances by Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa and New York Jets' Justin Fields led to their benching, with the Dolphins and Jets now both 1-13 combined. The article underscores a season marked by volatility, resilience, and evolving quarterback dynamics, illustrating how late-game pressure, team cohesion, and individual heroics shape outcomes in the NFL.",
