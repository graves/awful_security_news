  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a major theft occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where four thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery in just seven minutes and stole nine high-value royal artifacts, including a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and several items from Empress Eugénie’s collection. These items hold deep historical, cultural, and symbolic significance for France, as they represent key moments in Napoleonic and 19th-century royal history. The emerald necklace, crafted by François-Régnault Nitot and passed through Marie-Louise’s descendants, was acquired by the Louvre in 2004 for €3.7 million. The sapphire diadem, possibly linked to Marie Antoinette and previously held by the Orléans family, was acquired in 1985. The reliquary brooch and diamond bow brooch, both linked to Empress Eugénie, were crafted in the 1850s and later acquired by the Louvre in 1887 and 2008, respectively. One of the stolen items, Eugénie’s crown, was recovered near the scene but was damaged. Experts, including art recovery specialist Arthur Brand, describe the theft as a 'national disaster' due to the irreplaceable historical and cultural value of the pieces. The thieves are believed to have dismantled the items to sell or melt down the gold and silver, indicating a criminal intent focused on monetary gain. The incident has triggered widespread concern in France and globally, with CNN, TF1, and Le Parisien providing extensive reporting on the event and its implications for national heritage security.",
