  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has escalated drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and water infrastructure, particularly in northern regions such as Chernihiv and Sumy, with over 50 attacks reported in one night and 15 days of repeated strikes. These attacks aim to terrorize civilians and disrupt daily life, especially during cold weather. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes Russia’s tactics to an intent to 'kill people and terrorize them with cold.' In response, Ukraine has strengthened its air defenses and launched long-range missile strikes on Russian facilities like the Bryansk Chemical Plant. Zelensky is now turning to European allies for urgent military and financial aid, including proposals to use frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—to fund critical air defense systems such as the Patriot. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have offered large loans, though Russia disputes this as illegal. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya notes a pattern: when US President Donald Trump expresses frustration with Russia, Russian military actions intensify. Ukrainian officials remain wary of a potential peace summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, a close Putin ally, and reaffirm their belief that Ukraine remains the only party genuinely committed to peace, despite current pressures.",
