  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which thousands of websites and apps — including banking services, social media platforms, and airline booking systems — became inaccessible for several hours. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from reaching data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB service, even though the data itself remained intact. The outage highlights the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure, particularly due to the overreliance on a single cloud provider. Experts note that while AWS has a strong track record, the concentration of critical services in few cloud regions makes the system vulnerable to cascading failures. Previous major outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike bug and AT&T’s network collapse, demonstrate a recurring pattern of systemic risk in digital systems. The incident underscores a need for greater redundancy, diversification, and decentralization in internet architecture to prevent widespread disruption.",
