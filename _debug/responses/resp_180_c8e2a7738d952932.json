  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has officially shelved plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, following a breakdown in negotiations over Ukraine’s territorial integrity. While Trump had previously proposed talks that included territorial concessions in the Donbas, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies rejected such moves, insisting on a ceasefire at the current front line. Russia, led by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the Kremlin, maintains that a lasting peace requires full withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and recognition of Russian sovereignty over the Donbas, rejecting the idea of a temporary freeze. A potential U.S. supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine appears to have prompted Russia to engage in dialogue, suggesting that military escalation concerns are now driving diplomatic action. The failure to reach agreement indicates deep strategic divides and highlights the difficulty of achieving a sustainable peace in Ukraine.",
