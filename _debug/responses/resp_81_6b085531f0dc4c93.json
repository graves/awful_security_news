  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is actively opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products that would warn about a potential link between use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. The push originated from statements by former President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who claimed acetaminophen use increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, despite no established causal evidence. Multiple scientific studies, including one involving over 2 million children, have found no significant association between acetaminophen use and autism or ADHD. The FDA has not found clear evidence of harm and maintains that the current label, which advises consulting a health professional, is appropriate. International health agencies, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Health Canada, confirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue argues that the proposed labeling changes are unsupported by science, arbitrary, and contrary to established medical standards, and has formally requested the FDA deny the citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network.",
