  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg, has introduced a new policy requiring all military officials — including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to obtain prior approval from the Department’s legislative affairs office before engaging with Congress. This change, detailed in two memos issued on October 15 and October 17, aims to improve communication accuracy and transparency but has drawn criticism, especially after most Pentagon reporters resigned in protest. The policy centralizes control over communications, ending previous autonomy of military branches, and includes a working group to further refine guidelines. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell called the move a 'pragmatic step' to enhance responsiveness, though the broader implications for transparency and press freedom remain a subject of debate.",
