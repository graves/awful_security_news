These facilities offer advantages such as continuous solar access and reduced land use, but face major challenges including high launch costs, radiation, heat dissipation, and space debris. Projects like the European ASCEND initiative and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are testing small-scale space computing. While companies like China and SpaceX are already involved, experts like Quentin A. Parker remain skeptical about cost and practicality. Despite skepticism, proponents argue that space-based data centers are essential to avoid technological stagnation as terrestrial resources become scarce.
