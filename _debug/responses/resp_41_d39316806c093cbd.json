  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Queens, New York, represents a rare and resilient model of U.S. manufacturing. Despite rising costs, tariffs, and a shrinking workforce, the company thrives by relying on handcrafted quality, skilled artisans, and domestic sourcing. While mass production and automation have largely replaced traditional assembly lines, Steinway maintains a small, specialized workforce that produces world-class pianos over an 11-month process. The article highlights challenges such as the limited supply of Sitka spruce from Alaska and the difficulty of recruiting skilled workers. It contrasts this craft-based model with the broader struggles of U.S. manufacturing under President Trump’s trade policies, which have created uncertainty and inflation without necessarily boosting employment. Steinway’s longevity and success are attributed not only to its premium pricing and quality but also to its commitment to preserving traditional craftsmanship and training a new generation of skilled workers, making it a symbol of what sustainable, high-value manufacturing might look like in a modern economy.",
