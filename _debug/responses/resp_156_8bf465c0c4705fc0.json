    "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose sanctions on countries supporting the emissions reduction plan.",
    "The Net Zero Framework, already approved in April 2025, would have been the first global carbon-pricing system for shipping, charging ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions and rewarding emission reductions.",
    "Trump’s public criticism on Truth Social labeled the plan as a 'Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,' and threatened visa restrictions, port levies, and sanctions against supporting nations.",
    "The delay caused disappointment among environmental leaders and the International Chamber of Shipping, which stressed the need for clarity to enable decarbonization investments.",
    "Countries such as China, the EU, Britain, and Brazil reaffirmed support, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed the plan; Argentina and Singapore, previously supportive, voted to postpone.",
    "The IMO, composed of 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating international shipping safety and pollution, including climate-related emissions.",
    "The framework aims to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, addressing climate change impacts like altered ocean currents and more frequent storms.",
    "Proposed alternatives to fossil fuel-powered shipping include ammonia, methanol, and special sails to reduce reliance on bunker fuel."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system for shipping, by at least 12 months following U.S. President Donald Trump’s public threat to impose sanctions on countries supporting the plan. Trump labeled the initiative a 'Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping' and urged nations to oppose it, leading to a shift in voting dynamics. Although the framework had already been approved in April, the delay undermines progress toward reducing shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050. The decision has drawn criticism from environmental leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, who argue that the delay undermines climate action and industry planning. Major economies like China, the EU, and the UK backed the plan, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore opposed or abstained. The NZF would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, incentivizing cleaner fuel use such as ammonia and methanol, and addressing growing climate risks like extreme storms and altered ocean currents.",
