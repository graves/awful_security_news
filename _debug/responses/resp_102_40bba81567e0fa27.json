    "The term 'enshittification' describes the decline of internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber from being user-friendly and valuable in their early stages to becoming exploitative and degrading in later stages.",
    "Enshittification occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (growth and user acquisition), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at the cost of users and merchants).",
    "In Stage 3, platforms such as Facebook and Amazon are accused of charging excessive fees, manipulating algorithms, and promoting ads or boosted content over user preferences, leading to worse experiences for consumers and businesses.",
    "Doctorow cites studies showing that Amazon’s search results often display higher-priced items higher up in results and that the best match can be as far as 17 places down, increasing consumer costs.",
    "Amazon and Facebook have responded to Doctorow’s claims by stating that their platforms have improved over time and that his assertions about 'cloning' products or 'junk fees' are false or misleading.",
    "The core explanation for enshittification lies in a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, especially under the 'consumer welfare standard' in antitrust law.",
    "Doctorow advocates for stronger antitrust enforcement, 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing users to take their data or e-books with them), and improved interoperability between platforms to break down monopolistic barriers."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Cory Doctorow, a prominent internet activist and journalist, introduces his new book titled 'Enshittification' to describe how major internet platforms such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber have degraded from user-focused, early-stage services into exploitative, profit-driven systems. He outlines a three-stage process: Stage 1, where platforms grow rapidly and offer attractive, user-friendly experiences; Stage 2, where they prioritize business customers by manipulating feeds and offering subsidies; and Stage 3, where they aggressively extract profit through inflated fees, algorithmic manipulation, and poor search results, ultimately harming both users and merchants. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and insufficient regulation, especially under the consumer welfare standard. He proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations and improved interoperability to restore user trust and platform integrity. While Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, Doctorow supports them with data from studies and advocacy organizations, and the article frames enshittification as a critical issue for internet sustainability and democratic access to digital services.",
