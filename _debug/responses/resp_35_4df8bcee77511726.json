  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Roughly 42 million Americans are at risk of losing access to food stamp benefits in November due to a federal government shutdown that has depleted the USDAâ€™s funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Despite a $6 billion contingency fund, the projected $8 billion in November benefits cannot be covered. The Trump administration has not committed to funding SNAP, instead blaming Democrats for political obstruction, while states like New York have criticized the decision as harmful to vulnerable families. A similar funding crisis previously occurred in 2018, where a temporary provision allowed benefits to be paid after a lapse. This time, 17 states have halted new applications due to payment constraints, and while WIC was temporarily protected through a $300 million tariff revenue diversion, that same resource is insufficient for SNAP. Advocacy groups emphasize the urgency of the situation, particularly as Thanksgiving approaches, and call for immediate action to prevent widespread hunger among low-income households.",
