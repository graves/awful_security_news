  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008 has sparked decades of debate between two theories: that it comes from pulsars — the remnants of exploded stars — or from dark matter collisions. While earlier models suggested a spherical dark matter distribution, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk at Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter could instead form a squashed, egg-shaped structure in the galactic center — a shape that closely matches the observed glow. This raises the possibility that the glow is a sign of dark matter, particularly WIMPs, annihilating in space. The study suggests a 50% chance the glow originates from dark matter, compared to older stars. A key next step will be data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, which will provide higher-resolution gamma-ray observations to definitively confirm or reject the dark matter hypothesis. The article underscores that identifying dark matter remains one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in physics, and that the Fermi observations continue to fuel scientific interest and hope in solving this century-old mystery.",
