  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Belize, part of a broader Trump administration strategy to reduce asylum applications and increase deportations. The deal is framed as a commitment to international law and humanitarian principles, with Belize asserting it has safeguards including an absolute veto, nationality restrictions, and caps on transfers. However, critics argue the agreement may violate international humanitarian law, expose asylum seekers to unsafe conditions, and allow the US to circumvent its legal obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees. Belize faces domestic opposition, with opposition leaders claiming the country lacks capacity to provide adequate care, housing, healthcare, and legal representation. The agreement still requires Senate approval and is part of a wider trend involving countries like Guatemala, Eswatini, Rwanda, and Uganda, where concerns about human rights violations and abusive conditions persist. Recent cases — such as deportees being returned to their home countries — challenge the effectiveness and legitimacy of such deals.",
