  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees starting Monday, October 19, 2025, due to a government shutdown. Only about 400 workers will remain to ensure basic security, while key facilities like Pantex and Y-12 shut down, halting weapon assembly and surveillance. Contractors will stop minimal work by October 28, risking a complete halt in nuclear modernization. Although current stockpile reliability is not in danger, long-term safety and mission readiness depend on continued oversight. The shutdown marks the first time in 24 years that NNSA has furloughed staff during a funding gap, and officials warn that prolonged disruptions will harm national security, workforce retention, and timely weapon modernization, especially under pressure from the Department of Defense.",
