  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Plans for a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest were shelved by the White House after it became clear that fundamental disagreements over Ukraine’s territorial integrity—particularly regarding the Donbas region—could not be resolved. While Trump supported a ceasefire at the current battle line, Russia insisted on full Ukrainian troop withdrawal and recognition of Russian sovereignty over the area. The US and European allies emphasized the front-line freeze as a starting point for peace, which Russia dismissed as temporary. A key turning point was the discussion over the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which prompted Russia to enter diplomatic dialogue. The failure of previous high-level talks, including the 2025 Alaska summit, suggests a pattern of diplomatic deadlocks, reinforcing the view that a direct Trump-Putin meeting is unlikely without significant concessions from either side.",
