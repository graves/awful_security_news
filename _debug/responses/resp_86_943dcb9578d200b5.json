This move escalates diplomatic tensions between the two nations, which have clashed over drug trafficking, migration, and military strikes in the Caribbean. The US has provided about $210 million in aid to Colombia this fiscal year, with Colombia being the world's largest cocaine producer. Trump criticized Petro personally, calling him an 'illegal drug leader,' while Petro responded by invoking Colombian literature and cultural identity, referencing Gabriel García Márquez’s 'One Hundred Years of Solitude.' The conflict intensified after Petro accused the US of killing a Colombian national during a military strike and after the US revoked his visa. US military strikes on suspected drug boats have continued, with one strike resulting in survivors being returned to their home countries, signaling a broader policy of force in the fight against narcotics.",
