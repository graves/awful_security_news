  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to end the war, specifically rejecting the idea that Ukraine could regain all its lost territory. Trump, who previously claimed Ukraine might regain all its land, now advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the devastating realities of the conflict and fears of further casualties. This position contradicts earlier statements and reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to peace, influenced by his recent success in brokering a truce in Gaza. A Russian proposal involving Ukraine surrendering eastern Donbas in exchange for Russian-held areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia was reportedly discussed, though Trump denied asking for a full cession of Donbas. The meeting, described as tense and frank by European officials, ended with both leaders agreeing on a ceasefire at the current frontlines, which Zelensky supported. Despite claims of hostility, Ukrainian officials downplayed aggression, calling it a constructive dialogue. Trump’s emphasis on ending the war quickly and his concern about winter casualties reflect a broader foreign policy focus on rapid peace settlements, shaping the trajectory of future negotiations.",
