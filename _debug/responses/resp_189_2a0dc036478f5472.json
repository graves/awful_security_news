  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the global rise in drone threats, driven by affordability and widespread use, especially after the war in Ukraine. It highlights how anti-drone technologies—such as radio frequency jamming (used by MyDefence), acoustic and optical detection systems, and low-cost interceptors (like those from Nordic Air Defence)—are evolving to meet growing demand. The article emphasizes that while jamming and interception are effective, they must be paired with early detection and safer alternatives such as hacking or net-based capture. Civilian applications, particularly in shipping, oil, and critical infrastructure, are becoming increasingly important due to risks like property damage. Countries like Sweden and Denmark are investing heavily, and a proposed drone traffic management system with electronic license plates could help regulate drone activity and prevent misuse. The core takeaway is that the defense industry must shift toward affordable, scalable, and non-destructive solutions to keep pace with the rapidly evolving drone threat.",
