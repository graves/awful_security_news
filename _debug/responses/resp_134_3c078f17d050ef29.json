  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States conducted a military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean, claiming it was transporting fentanyl and other illegal drugs, resulting in at least 32 deaths.

The incident has triggered significant diplomatic tensions, with Colombia recalling its ambassador to the U.S. and President Gustavo Petro criticizing U.S. actions as extrajudicial and violent. Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa expressed firm support for international cooperation in fighting drug trafficking, while U.S. President Donald Trump defended the attacks as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, invoking the legal framework used after 9/11. Critics argue that such actions undermine regional stability and bilateral relations, especially with key allies like Colombia and Ecuador.",
