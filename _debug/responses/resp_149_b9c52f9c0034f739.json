  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American teenager, has been detained in Israeli prisons since February 2025 after being taken into custody during a raid on his family's home in the occupied West Bank. He describes severe conditions including cold cells, minimal meals (such as just three pieces of bread and a spoonful of labneh for breakfast), lack of heating or cooling, and no dinner or fruit. He has lost significant weight and has been charged with throwing stones at Israeli settlers, a charge he denies. The case has drawn international attention from human rights groups like Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), U.S. lawmakers, and advocacy figures, who argue that Israel is the only country that systematically prosecutes children in military courts. Despite being a U.S. citizen, he remains in detention, and his family and U.S. officials are urging the Trump administration to use diplomatic pressure to secure his release. The case has gained renewed urgency following the Gaza ceasefire deal and the release of other Palestinian detainees, as well as reports of abuse and deaths of Palestinian prisoners since October 2023.",
