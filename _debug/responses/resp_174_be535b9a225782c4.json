  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing better than expected, with US Vice-President JD Vance confirming its resilience during a visit to Israel. Despite renewed violence that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli air strikes, Hamas has maintained its commitment to the deal and has returned the bodies of 13 of 28 deceased hostages. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pushing for long-term negotiations on an interim Palestinian government, disarmament of Hamas, troop withdrawal, and international stabilisation. However, humanitarian access remains severely limited, with only two aid crossings functional and significant food shortages in the Gaza north. The ceasefire faces challenges from both military actions and political demands, including Israel's insistence that Hamas return all hostages before joining peace talks. The situation underscores the fragile balance between military enforcement and humanitarian relief in a high-stakes geopolitical conflict.",
