  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "New tariffs imposed by the US government under President Donald Trump on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture are increasing construction and renovation costs, adding significant pressure to an already weak housing market. These tariffs, which follow previous measures such as 50% levies on steel and copper, are expected to raise prices for consumers, with Goldman Sachs estimating up to 55% of the cost being passed on. Homebuyers like Anthony Cabrera, contractors, and furniture companies such as RH and IKEA are directly affected, with RH facing $30 million in new costs and IKEA warning of price hikes. Even domestic businesses like Colony and Stillfried Design are impacted by rising material costs and consumer hesitation. Economists warn that the cumulative effect of these tariffs—especially with upcoming increases in January—could push developers to abandon affordable housing projects and further weaken the housing market, despite the fact that no single policy is expected to cause a total collapse.",
