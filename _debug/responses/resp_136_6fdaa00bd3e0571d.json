The ECA advocates for a global zero-tolerance policy requiring the permanent removal of priests involved in any act of sexual abuse. This meeting, the first between a pope and an activist advocacy group, follows precedent set by earlier popes who distanced themselves from such groups. Participants from multiple countries — including Canada, Germany, Uganda, and the U.S. — emphasized the need for equitable protections across cultures and regions, with survivors highlighting the Pope’s understanding of cultural barriers, particularly in Africa. The meeting reflects a broader movement toward transparency, healing, and accountability within the Church, with ECA’s key initiatives including a conference on abuse in Opus Dei and support for survivor-led organizations in the Philippines.",
