  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In April 2025, a narrow one-vote victory in the Terrebonne electoral district of Quebec—won by Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste over incumbent Bloc Québécois Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné—has been challenged after a voter, Emmanuelle Bossé, claimed her mail-in ballot was not counted due to a postal code error on an envelope incorrectly printed by Elections Canada. The error, involving the wrong postal code being applied to ballots, led to a legal dispute now underway in Quebec’s Superior Court, where both parties argue over whether the result should be upheld or overturned. While Sinclair-Desgagné’s legal team warns that overturning the result would undermine public trust, Auguste’s team argues that it would deny voters their right to vote. The case underscores the profound impact that administrative errors can have on election outcomes and raises broader concerns about the integrity and transparency of electoral systems.",
