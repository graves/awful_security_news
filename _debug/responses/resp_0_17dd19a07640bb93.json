  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned by Hamas to Israel, alongside Israeli citizen Ronen Engel. The return of these bodies marks a critical step in the ceasefire agreement, though the broader crisis persists due to delays in returning the remaining hostages and ongoing military actions. Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains, while Israel accuses it of withholding information and using bodies as leverage. The ceasefire is under strain due to Israeli strikes, the closure of the Rafah crossing, and international warnings of further violations. Protests have erupted in Israel, and the US has warned of an imminent Hamas ceasefire breach, underscoring the fragile and contested nature of the truce. The full resolution of the crisis remains dependent on the return of all hostages and the implementation of ceasefire terms.",
