  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans and VA mental health providers are raising alarm over a policy change implemented under VA Secretary Doug Collins, which limits the number of long-term one-on-one therapy sessions available to veterans, particularly those with chronic conditions like PTSD. Despite patient and provider concerns about the clinical appropriateness of fixed session limits, the VA claims there are no such limits and that care is tailored to individual needs. However, providers report being pressured to terminate sessions and face disciplinary consequences for resisting these mandates. Veterans describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized, especially when therapy ends before recovery is complete. Staff members have resigned in frustration, and there is growing concern that the policy undermines trust, recovery, and long-term mental health stability â€” particularly when compared to the continuity of care provided for physical conditions like diabetes. Experts and professional organizations are calling for more patient-centered, collaborative treatment planning that respects the chronic nature of mental health conditions.",
