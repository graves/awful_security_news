  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, a federal ICE operation that resulted in over 1,000 migrant arrests between September and October 2025. In response to reports of excessive force and lack of warning during protests, particularly at the Broadview detention facility and in Albany Park, Judge Ellis expanded her temporary restraining order to require federal agents, especially ICE Special Response Teams, to wear body-worn cameras during encounters with demonstrators. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE teams lack them and have not been issued since their deployment. Testimony from ICE and CBP officials reveals training in crowd control and media handling, but also raises concerns about inconsistent enforcement and a 'revolving door' of leadership. A pastor reported being struck multiple times with pepper balls without warning, prompting judicial scrutiny. Federal officials, including the White House, have denied media reports of tear gas use, while legal representatives argue the judge relies on selective media coverage. The judge plans to depose former ICE field office head Russell Hott and CBP chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino to obtain on-the-ground insights into enforcement decisions.",
