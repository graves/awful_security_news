  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live-fire demonstration involving a 155mm artillery shell fired over the I-5 interstate, the busiest highway in America. The shell prematurely detonated, sending fragments that damaged a California Highway Patrol cruiser. This incident, which occurred despite the highway being closed in advance by Governor Gavin Newsom due to safety concerns, raised serious questions about the safety and reliability of the artillery batch and the decision-making process behind the firing. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause, while experts point out that such an event — especially a premature detonation — is abnormal, even if high-altitude firing was considered safe in theory. The incident occurs in the context of a broader surge in US artillery production since 2022, driven by Ukraine's war effort and increased manufacturing output, which has also been associated with past manufacturing issues, including shifts in explosive materials and cracks in shells. No injuries were reported, but the event has sparked tensions between state and federal authorities and raised public concern about military safety protocols during public demonstrations.",
