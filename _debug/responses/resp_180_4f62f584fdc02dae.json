  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Subramanyam 'Subu' Vedam, a legal permanent resident from India who moved to the U.S. at nine months old, was wrongfully imprisoned for over 40 years for the murder of his former roommate, Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student, with no physical evidence linking him to the crime. After being exonerated in early 2025, Vedam was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who seeks to deport him to India â€” a country he has not lived in since infancy. Despite his innocence and decades of good behavior, community service, and education, the deportation order based on a 1988 conviction for a drug offense remains in effect. His family and legal team are challenging the deportation, arguing that his strong ties to the U.S. and rehabilitation should be recognized, and that sending him to a distant country with few connections constitutes another profound injustice. This case underscores the need for reform in how immigration enforcement handles individuals who have been wrongfully convicted and rehabilitated.",
