  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the 2025 theft of eight Napoleonic jewellery pieces from the Louvre Museum in Paris, marking a shift from previous high-profile heists that targeted paintings like the Mona Lisa. It traces the museum’s history of thefts, including the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia, which boosted the painting’s global fame, and the 1940 Nazi occupation, during which artworks were moved to prevent looting. The article emphasizes that jewellery thefts are distinct due to their high intrinsic value—items that can be recut and sold separately, making recovery extremely difficult. Experts like Noah Charney note that the only realistic chance of recovery is through a reward for the items being returned intact. The piece also references past thefts, such as the 1966 jewellery theft during a U.S. display and the 1990 theft of a Renoir portrait, to illustrate long-standing vulnerabilities in museum security and international art transport.",
