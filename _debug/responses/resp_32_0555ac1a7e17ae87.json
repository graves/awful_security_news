  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s hopes for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have collapsed, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This shift follows a failed attempt to use high-level advisor talks between Secretary Marco Rubio and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to build momentum, as both sides diverged on key issues like ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials maintain that no summit can be postponed without a scheduled date, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blames the U.S. decision not to provide long-range missiles to Ukraine for Russia’s reduced interest in diplomacy. Despite the pause, the White House reaffirms Trump’s commitment to peace, and future diplomatic efforts may take place at an ASEAN summit in Malaysia. The article underscores the complexity of U.S.-Russia relations and the role of military support as a key factor in diplomatic progress.",
