  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major outage on Monday due to a Domain Name System (DNS) error at its primary data center in northern Virginia, disrupting services for over 1,000 companies and affecting global platforms such as Snapchat, Reddit, Roblox, Fortnite, Lloyds, Halifax, Canva, and HMRC. The outage, likely caused by human error or maintenance issues, underscores the risks of over-reliance on a single dominant cloud provider. Despite the existence of alternatives like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, and Alibaba, AWS remains the most widely used platform, with limited viable options for businesses and governments. This incident has intensified discussions in the UK and Europe about the need to build domestic cloud infrastructure to reduce dependence on US-based services, even though such efforts may be seen as redundant due to AWS's extensive global reach.",
