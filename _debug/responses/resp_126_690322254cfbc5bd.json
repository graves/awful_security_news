  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison on Monday after being extradited from France. The case remained dormant for nearly 12 years due to prosecutorial reluctance and the destruction of evidence, including a rape kit. Shannon Keeler, the victim, pursued legal action for years, eventually reactivating the case after Cleary sent a Facebook message in 2019 that said, 'So I raped you.' Her public advocacy, including a 2021 Associated Press story, drew attention to systemic failures in campus sexual assault cases. Cleary pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and expressed remorse, citing a 12-step program as part of his atonement. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, imposed a sentence below state guidelines due to Cleary’s guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. The case underscores the long-term trauma victims face and the broader issues of accountability, evidence preservation, and institutional failure in handling campus sexual assault.",
