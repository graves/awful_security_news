  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans seeking long-term mental health care through the VA are experiencing abrupt termination of one-on-one therapy sessions, with providers reporting that a policy introduced under VA Secretary Doug Collins in January 2025 mandates a strict, standardized number of sessions â€” often ending before patients are ready or clinically appropriate. This has led to staff resignations, provider disciplinary threats, and veteran distress, including feelings of abandonment and re-traumatization. While some limited sessions may be suitable for certain conditions, providers and veterans argue that chronic mental health conditions like PTSD require ongoing, individualized care. Critics, including the American Psychological Association, emphasize the need for shared decision-making and patient-centered care. Veterans like Michael and Jake Pannell express deep concern that such policies undermine recovery, especially when patients have already built trust with their therapists and need continuity of care. The VA maintains that there are no session limits, but providers and patients report widespread implementation of restrictive practices, raising questions about patient safety, clinical ethics, and the adequacy of VA mental health services.",
