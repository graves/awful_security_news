  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's call for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine, using record numbers of guided aerial bombs and attack drones—over 3,270 drones and 1,370 guided bombs in recent days—targeting Ukrainian military positions and infrastructure. Key areas under pressure include Kupiansk and Vovchansk in Kharkiv, and Pokrovsk in Donetsk, where Ukrainian forces report territorial recapture. While Russia has gained approximately 120 square miles in territory, Ukraine's military and leadership, including Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, maintain that the enemy lacks strategic initiative. Russia has suffered massive casualties—up to 250,000 killed—and is reportedly shifting recruitment tactics, reducing incentives and potentially mobilizing reserves. Ukraine is responding with long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Despite these setbacks, Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no sign of agreeing to negotiations, indicating a prolonged and asymmetric war with no clear resolution in sight.",
