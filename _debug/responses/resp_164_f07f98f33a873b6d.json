  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the dramatic rise in supermarket orange juice prices in the UK, which have increased by 134% since 2020, driven by a confluence of factors including citrus greening disease, extreme weather, droughts, overreliance on key suppliers like Brazil and Florida, new trade tariffs, and packaging regulations. While prices have dipped slightly in 2023, inflation has since rebounded to 3.8%, and orange juice is now a key indicator of broader food cost increases. Manufacturers are responding by substituting oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins and mangoes. The situation is not isolated, as similar price spikes are seen in beef, butter, chocolate, and coffee. The article highlights the UK's dependence on imported fruit and its vulnerability to global supply shocks, with experts suggesting that rising prices may persist due to structural market imbalances, lack of competition, and long-term climate and disease risks. Ultimately, the price surge reflects both immediate supply disruptions and deeper systemic issues in global food supply chains.",
