  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa is developing in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, threatening heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and mudslides across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. A hurricane watch has been issued for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. The storm’s path remains uncertain, with two main scenarios being tracked: one where it turns north toward the Caribbean islands, and another where it moves west toward Central America. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, rough seas and rain could affect the East Coast and Florida. The storm highlights the increasing trend of rapid intensification in late-season hurricanes, which is linked to climate change and warmer ocean waters. The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is still active, with Melissa marking the first hurricane to form in the Caribbean this year.",
