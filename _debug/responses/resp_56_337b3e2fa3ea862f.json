  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI director, has launched a legal defense against federal charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, claiming the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His legal team argues that Trump's personal attacks on Comey and the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—after the 120-day limit for interim appointments had expired—violates constitutional provisions on executive appointments. They also claim that the Justice Department selectively prosecuted Comey while avoiding charges against other top Trump administration officials, suggesting bias. The defense asserts that this constitutes an abuse of power and retaliation against protected speech, and requests that the judge dismiss the charges or investigate prosecutorial decisions. The case has drawn significant public attention due to its implications for executive overreach, the role of Congress in appointments, and the boundaries of protected speech in politics.",
