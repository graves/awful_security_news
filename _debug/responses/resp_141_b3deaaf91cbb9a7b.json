  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A planned Trump-Putin summit in Hungary, initially announced after a phone call on October 16, has been canceled by both the US White House and Russian officials. The delay stems from fundamental disagreements over ceasefire conditions—Russia demands full control of Ukraine’s Donbas region and dismantling of Ukrainian military capabilities, while Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy advocate for freezing current battle lines. Despite a prior phone call between US and Russian foreign ministers, no further in-person meetings are planned. Both sides maintain that their positions from the August Alaska summit remain unchanged, though the US and European leaders criticize Russia’s maximalist stance and stalling tactics. The situation underscores growing diplomatic deadlock and the lack of progress toward a sustainable ceasefire in Ukraine.",
