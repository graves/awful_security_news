  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, over 500 cancer survivors and advocates from across the United States, including New York volunteers such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin, participated in an annual citizen lobbying event in Washington, D.C. Despite deep political divisions—Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times, Mealing is a Democrat, and Martin has no explicit political stance—the group united around their shared experience of cancer. Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the event occurred during a federal government shutdown, underscoring the urgency of health policy advocacy. Volunteers wore matching blue polo shirts and delivered personal stories to lawmakers, advocating for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and federal support for health insurance subsidies. While many Republican lawmakers opposed subsidies, both parties supported increased research and screening. After their lobbying efforts, the group held a candlelight vigil on the National Mall, honoring 10,000 survivors of cancer. The event exemplifies how personal trauma and shared illness can overcome partisan divides, offering a powerful model for cross-party collaboration in a deeply polarized political environment.",
