  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Boeing cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, October 19, 2025, after landing from Dubai. The aircraft broke in two upon impact and struck an airport security patrol car, killing two occupants. The four crew members were treated for injuries but are confirmed safe, and no cargo was on board. The incident occurred without any distress signals from the pilots, prompting emergency response efforts involving over 200 personnel, fire engines, and boats. The airport suspended operations on the north runway, but operations on two other runways ensured minimal disruption to over 1,000 daily flights. While HKIA has a strong safety record, the event underscores risks even at one of the world’s busiest and most advanced airports, especially when considering past incidents like the 1999 China Airlines crash during a typhoon and the historical difficulty of landing at the former Kai Tak Airport.",
