  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in modern American culture — from fashion and advertising to television and politics — noting that this trend is deeply tied to cultural conservatism, particularly under the Trump administration and in response to perceived urban liberalism. It traces the origin of the cowboy myth to 19th-century performances like the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and the romanticized films of Gene Autry and John Wayne, which linked cowboys to American patriotism. However, the article emphasizes that this portrayal is a myth: real cowboys were often Mexican, Native, or enslaved Black Americans, and their contributions have been historically ignored. The article highlights how modern media, including Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour and photography by Gabriela Hasbun, is beginning to showcase Black cowboy culture, though it is still often 'whitewashed' in mainstream narratives. The piece also critiques how political figures like Donald Trump use cowboy symbolism to promote individualism and anti-establishment values, and how Western media selectively shows only the heroic aspects of cowboy life, omitting poverty, labor struggles, and systemic inequality. Ultimately, the article argues that the cowboy is not a historical truth but a cyclical cultural construct — one that reflects broader political, social, and racial dynamics in American society.",
