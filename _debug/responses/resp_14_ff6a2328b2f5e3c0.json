  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year giant panda program after Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji were returned to China in 2025. The program began in 1972 as a symbol of 'panda diplomacy' following President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the gift of two pandas from Chairman Mao Zedong. Over time, pandas were loaned to other U.S. zoos, including Zoo Atlanta, with the U.S. contributing significant funds to China’s conservation efforts. The program's decline correlates with worsening U.S.-China relations and public backlash over alleged abuse of pandas in Memphis. As China redirects its panda diplomacy, countries like Russia and Qatar have received pandas, while Scotland and Australia are set to lose theirs. Only Mexico’s Xin Xin remains in the Americas, making it a rare cultural and diplomatic beacon. Despite the end of the U.S. program, staff remain hopeful for a future return, and renovations are planned for the vacant exhibit. The event underscores how diplomatic gestures involving animals reflect broader geopolitical shifts.",
