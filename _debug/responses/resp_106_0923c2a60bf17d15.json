  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House began demolishing part of the East Wing in October 2025 to construct a $250 million ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite lacking formal approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The project, announced in July 2025, is described as the largest structural change to the White House since the 1948 addition of the Truman Balcony, with plans to accommodate 999 people. President Trump claims the project is privately funded by corporations and individuals, with no cost to taxpayers, and asserts that the existing East Room is too small. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and home to the First Lady’s offices, will be temporarily relocated during construction. Carrier Global Corp. has agreed to provide a world-class HVAC system. The National Capital Planning Commission, which typically approves major renovations, has not reviewed the plans, and its chairman, Will Scharf, stated that demolition and site prep fall outside its jurisdiction. While the White House claims transparency, it has not disclosed specific donors to the project, raising concerns about accountability and oversight.",
