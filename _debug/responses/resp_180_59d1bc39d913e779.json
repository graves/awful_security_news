  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The daughter of Ronen Engel, a 54-year-old Israeli photographer and volunteer ambulance driver, said her father is 'finally home' after his remains were returned from Gaza as part of a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Engel, along with 30-year-old Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri, were among the 12 dead hostages returned under the agreement, which promised the release of all hostages. Their return has sparked outrage in Israel due to delays caused by Hamas's inability to locate bodies amid rubble and Israel’s restrictions on heavy machinery access. The ceasefire also included the return of 20 living hostages, the release of over 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and the return of 135 Palestinian bodies. However, tensions persist, including the closure of the Rafah border crossing, a deadly tank shell incident killing 11 Palestinians, and accusations from the UN of genocide by Israel. The US has downplayed accusations of a breach, citing possible delays in body recovery. The human and political dimensions of the crisis continue to dominate public discourse.",
