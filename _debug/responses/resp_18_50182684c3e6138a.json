  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. The victory follows a deepening economic crisis marked by high inflation, fuel shortages, and declining natural gas exports. Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, securing a narrow legislative majority in the lower house (49 seats) and 16 in the Senate, but lacks a majority and must form alliances to govern. His platform promotes private sector-led growth and gradual reform, contrasting with Quiroga’s proposal for sweeping cuts and an IMF bailout. Both candidates pledged to strengthen ties with the United States, with Paz unveiling a $1.5 billion economic deal to secure fuel supplies. The new administration faces significant economic and political challenges, including securing fuel, phasing out subsidies, and managing potential opposition from the main labor union, COB. The election signals a major shift in Bolivia’s political direction, with voters seeking economic change and alternatives to long-standing governance.",
