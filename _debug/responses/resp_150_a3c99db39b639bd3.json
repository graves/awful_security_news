The investigation found that the braking system failed to prevent the crash despite being activated, and the tramway’s counterweight system became inoperative after the cable disconnection. As a result, all funiculars in Lisbon are being kept closed for the foreseeable future until a final safety report from the GPIAAF is issued within the next year. The victims included five Portuguese nationals and 11 foreigners from various countries, highlighting the international human toll of the incident.",
