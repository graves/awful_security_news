  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and education advisor, identified a critical educational inequity: despite elite universities recruiting top athletes from low-income backgrounds, they remain largely inaccessible to high-achieving low-income students. This insight, shaped by her work under New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s education administration, led her to co-found the National Education Equity Lab in 2019. The initiative, now known as the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), delivers credit-bearing college courses from 17 elite universities—including Harvard—to over 40,000 students in 33 states, primarily in Title I schools. NEON’s model includes teacher training, student mentorship, and direct course delivery via Zoom, with evidence that students who complete courses are twice as likely to attend and persist in four-year colleges. Despite limited funding—only $7.5 million in annual revenue—the network has expanded to include schools in Jackson, Mississippi, and New York City, and plans to serve 1 million low-income students in 10 years. The model has received support from major foundations, private institutions, and individual donors like Henry McCance, and is being adopted by school leaders across the U.S. as a scalable, evidence-based solution to college access inequality.",
