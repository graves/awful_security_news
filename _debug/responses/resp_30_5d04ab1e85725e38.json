    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its extreme cold, has confirmed the presence of mosquitoes in the wild for the first time.",
    "The mosquitoes identified are from the species Culiseta annulata, native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates.",
    "The discovery was made in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed a fly at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The insects were collected and identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.",
    "This is the first confirmed case of mosquitoes thriving in Iceland's natural environment, unlike a previous isolated case from a plane in 1990s or earlier.",
    "Climate change is a factor that may have enabled mosquitoes to survive and potentially establish in Iceland, though experts remain cautious about direct causation.",
    "Mosquitoes are disease-carrying insects and their expansion into new regions due to warming temperatures raises global health concerns.",
    "Iceland has already experienced extreme heat waves, including a May 2025 heatwave 40 times more likely due to climate change, which may have facilitated this event.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson caution that while warming may increase the likelihood of mosquito presence, the full impact of climate change on mosquito range shifts remains uncertain."

The insects were identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marking a significant ecological shift. While climate change may have contributed to the event by warming temperatures and increasing heat extremes, experts caution that the discovery may also be due to natural factors or prior climate variability. The presence of these cold-adapted mosquitoes raises concerns about future expansion of disease-carrying insects in the region and underscores the broader impacts of climate change on global ecosystems.",
