  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI director, has launched a legal defense strategy to have federal charges against him dropped, arguing that the prosecution is a retaliatory act by President Donald Trump due to Comey’s public criticism of him. His attorneys claim that Trump personally targeted Comey, citing a pattern of public attacks, and assert that the appointment of interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawful, as it bypassed the 120-day interim limit and Senate confirmation requirements under the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. The defense also draws on the precedent of a dismissed Trump indictment in Florida, where a judge ruled that a similar unlawful appointment was invalid. These arguments are grounded in constitutional principles protecting free speech and executive accountability.",
