  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis continues to investigate federal responses to protests in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz, a major ICE enforcement campaign resulting in over 1,000 arrests. She expanded her temporary restraining order to require body-worn cameras for all agents on the ground, especially when using tear gas or pepper balls, citing concerns over lack of warning and transparency. While CBP agents are required to wear cameras, ICE Special Response Teams are not, and have not been issued such equipment. Agents from both agencies are trained on protest response and press handling, but incidents involving Reverend David Black—accused of being struck without warning—have raised serious concerns about accountability and protocol. Federal leadership has been described as unstable due to frequent personnel changes, and Judge Ellis plans to continue questioning top officials, including Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino, to clarify on-the-ground actions and compliance with court-ordered restrictions.",
