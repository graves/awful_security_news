  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown a positive trend, rising to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025, up from 376 in 2024, following a 25% decline between 2010 and 2020. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report that while the population remains vulnerable due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement, signs of recovery are emerging—including four mother whales giving birth to calves in 2024 and shorter intervals between births among established mothers. Despite only 11 calves being born, which is below researchers' expectations, the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging. Conservation efforts, especially new management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence, are cited as key factors in the recovery. However, environmental groups warn that continued political attacks on the Marine Mammal Protection Act and weakening of science-based protections could jeopardize the fragile recovery, emphasizing the need for sustained conservation action."
