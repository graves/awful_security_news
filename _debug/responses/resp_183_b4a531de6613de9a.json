  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, due to the absence of any legal charge of criminal activity in Ecuadorean territory. The US claims the vessel was a drug-carrying submarine transporting fentanyl, and that it was targeting 'narco-terrorists,' including members of the Cartel of the Suns linked to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. However, experts question the legality and accuracy of these claims, noting that fentanyl primarily enters the US from Mexico, not the southern Caribbean. The US has carried out at least seven strikes since September 2025, killing at least 32 people and capturing two survivors—Tufiño and Jeison Obando Pérez. The Colombian survivor suffers a traumatic brain injury and is receiving treatment in Bogotá, while the US and Colombia have exchanged sharp diplomatic words, with Petro accusing the US of violating territorial waters and Trump retaliating with threats of aid cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago supports the US military intervention, emphasizing regional peace and anti-trafficking goals.",
