The company faces challenges such as a shortage of Sitka spruce wood from Alaska and a dwindling pool of skilled workers, but has preserved its workforce through apprenticeship programs and a legacy of continuous operation since 1873. The article highlights a broader contrast between traditional craftsmanship and modern manufacturing trends, suggesting that only specialized, high-value industries like Steinway can thrive in the current economic climate.",
