  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A bomb exploded outside the home of Italian investigative journalist Sigfrido Ranucci, who hosts RAI’s 'Report,' a program known for its critical reporting on government actions. The device, likely made from firework explosives, was planted at his home in Campo Ascolano, near Rome, and occurred about 20 minutes after he returned home, causing significant damage to vehicles and a nearby house but no injuries. Ranucci has long been under police protection due to threats, and while he has not confirmed a direct link between the attack and his journalism, anti-Mafia prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible mafia-style criminal damage. The incident has drawn strong reactions from political figures, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who condemned it as a serious act of intimidation against press freedom, and Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who confirmed stepped-up protection for Ranucci. The attack reflects the ongoing political tensions between the Italian government and investigative journalism, with several members of Meloni’s coalition having previously sued the 'Report' program over its critical coverage.",
