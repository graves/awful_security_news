  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, the Big Cities Health Coalition—a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities—issued a strong public statement urging vaccination, criticizing federal officials, including President Donald Trump and CDC advisers, for spreading false claims and altering vaccine schedules. The coalition highlights rising measles outbreaks, declining public trust in the CDC, and growing political interference in public health policy as key threats. They emphasize that vaccines are essential to keeping schools open, protecting vulnerable populations, and maintaining public health in a fragmented system where local jurisdictions are interconnected. Despite HHS claims of restoring scientific integrity, public trust in the CDC has dropped to just 50%, prompting local leaders to step in and provide science-based, data-driven messaging to their communities.",
