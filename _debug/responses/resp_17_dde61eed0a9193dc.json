  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests across Africa, Asia, and South America—primarily driven by Generation Z—have resulted in significant political changes, including the removal of leaders in Madagascar, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In Madagascar, the protests led to the ousting of President Andry Rajoelina, though the military under Michael Randrianirina now controls the government. The movement, led by spokesperson Elliot Randriamandrato, emphasizes a convergence of youth mobilization and military support as the key to success. Similar trends are observed in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Kenya, with youth protesting over corruption, economic hardship, and lack of services. African leaders, including those in Uganda and Kenya, are increasingly aware of this threat, as youth populations are large, unemployed, and politically active. Experts warn that if governance fails to address youth frustrations, such movements could become a regular feature of African political life. The role of technology and social media in organizing protests is a common thread, and the success in Madagascar may inspire renewed activism in countries where protests have stalled or been suppressed.",
