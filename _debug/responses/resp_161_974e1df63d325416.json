  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage originating in Virginia's data center due to a flawed technical update to DynamoDB’s API caused a DNS failure, preventing apps from connecting to servers. This cascaded into disruptions across 113 AWS services, affecting major platforms like Snapchat, WhatsApp, Roblox, banking apps, gaming services, media outlets, and smart home devices. The incident, attributed to human error rather than cyberattack, underscored the critical role of cloud infrastructure in modern digital life. AWS quickly restored services, and experts noted that despite the scale of disruption, the company's dominant market position and deep user integration mean users are unlikely to migrate away. The event highlights both the fragility and indispensability of cloud-based systems in everyday technology.",
