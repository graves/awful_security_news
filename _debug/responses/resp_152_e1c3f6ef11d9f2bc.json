  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli forces killed 11 members of a Palestinian family in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighborhood, marking the deadliest breach of the ceasefire since its implementation eight days earlier. The attack involved a tank shell fired at a civilian vehicle as the family attempted to inspect their home, resulting in seven children and three women among the dead. Hamas condemned the incident as a 'massacre,' calling on global leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, to pressure Israel to respect the truce. The violation of the so-called 'yellow line' — a demarcation line meant to define Israeli military withdrawal — highlights ongoing enforcement failures. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has killed at least 28 Palestinians, sealed key border crossings like Rafah, and blocked access to heavy machinery needed by Hamas to recover Israeli captives’ remains. Humanitarian conditions remain dire, with only 560 tonnes of food delivered daily and 49% of Gazans receiving less than six litres of water per day, far below emergency levels. This incident underscores the fragility of peace, the humanitarian crisis, and the failure of ceasefire mechanisms to protect civilians.",
