  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 for falsifying personal and campaign financial information and pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos began serving his sentence in July 2024 and was released on October 18, 2025, following the commutation. The move drew attention to Trump’s broader use of executive clemency, including a blanket pardon of over 1,500 individuals connected to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and a pardon of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Trump framed Santos' actions as more severe than past political misstatements, such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s military service claim, and emphasized Santos' unwavering support for the Republican Party. This decision has sparked debate over the role of presidential power in the criminal justice system and the implications of political loyalty influencing judicial outcomes.",
