    "The internet is undergoing a process of 'enshittification' — a degradation in quality and user experience in digital platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber, as companies prioritize profit over user value.",
    "This process occurs in three stages: (1) initial user acquisition through attractive pricing and network effects, (2) favoring business customers at the expense of users, and (3) turning platforms into profit-driven systems that harm both users and merchants.",
    "Doctorow argues that platforms exploit network effects, high switching costs, and lack of competition to maintain dominance, and that this is worsened by weak regulatory oversight and the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law.",
    "Amazon and Facebook are cited as examples where practices such as algorithmic manipulation, predatory pricing, and 'junk fees' have harmed users and sellers.",
    "Doctorow proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations, interoperability standards, and stronger antitrust enforcement to reverse enshittification.",
    "The theory has sparked debate, with Amazon disputing claims about cloning products and junk fees, asserting that Amazon’s value to customers has improved over time."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the theory of 'enshittification,' a concept coined by internet activist and journalist Cory Doctorow, which describes how major internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade in quality over time. Doctorow outlines a three-stage process: first, platforms attract users with attractive deals and user-friendly features; second, they shift focus to business customers, exploiting data and user behavior; and third, they begin to extract maximum profit, worsening user experience through manipulated algorithms, predatory pricing, and excessive fees. The article critiques the current regulatory environment, especially the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law, and proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations and increased interoperability. While Amazon and Facebook dispute specific claims, the theory has gained public traction, with support from both consumer advocates and some conservatives, indicating a growing movement to address the decline of internet platforms and restore user trust.",
