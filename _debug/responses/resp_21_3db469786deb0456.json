  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where heavy rainfall—potentially over a foot—could trigger flash flooding and dangerous mudslides due to mountainous terrain. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may receive rain and wind, though direct U.S. landfall is unlikely. The storm’s intensification is linked to the Caribbean Sea's unusually warm waters, a result of climate change, and echoes the trend of rapid intensification seen in earlier storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Two main track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa turns north and impacts Hispaniola, and another where it moves west toward Central America. While the U.S. is not at high risk, late-season storm activity remains possible, as demonstrated by past hurricanes like Nicole and Zeta. The article underscores the growing role of climate change in altering hurricane behavior and intensification patterns.",
