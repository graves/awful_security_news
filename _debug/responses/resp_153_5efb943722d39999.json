  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a renewed escalation of trade tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals. This move, announced on October 10, 2025, follows months of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions, with China accusing the U.S. of 'double standards' and targeting its industries under the guise of national security. China, which holds a near-monopoly over rare earths critical to technologies like electric vehicles and semiconductors, has tightened export controls effective December 1, 2025, as a strategic move ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea. The U.S. response—threatening a 100% tariff and export controls on critical software—has intensified global uncertainty, with experts noting that both nations are weaponizing economic interdependence. While China has demonstrated greater strategic coordination in its policies, the U.S. maintains broader global influence and leverage. Analysts warn that neither side is willing to back down, and the outcome hinges not on diplomacy but on market reactions and the ability to absorb economic pain. This episode reflects a broader trend of deepening security-economic integration, where trade becomes a tool of national power competition.",
