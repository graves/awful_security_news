  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million federal workers—including contractors and long-term employees from agencies such as the Department of Commerce and Department of Agriculture—are furloughed or working without pay. This has led to widespread financial hardship, prompting a large-scale food bank event in Landover, Maryland, organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries. The event, which required federal employees to show work IDs, served more than 370 households—more than double the expected number—highlighting the severity of the crisis. Federal workers like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams express shock at losing job security and financial stability. While GOP Senator Ron Johnson proposes a limited pay plan for workers still working, Democrats push for universal compensation. The situation reflects broader societal concerns about the resilience of public sector workers in times of political gridlock and economic instability.",
