While Liberty Vote’s public messaging emphasizes transparency, American ownership, and election security, private communications from election officials in Colorado and Georgia indicate continuity in operations, staff, and technology. Critics, including experts like David Becker and activists like Joe Oltmann, question the political motivations behind the move, citing a partisan tone in the press release and lack of prior notice to county officials. Despite concerns, election officials stress that the actual voting technology and verification processes — including paper ballots and risk-limiting audits — remain unchanged. The event underscores deep public skepticism about voting systems and the ongoing challenge of restoring trust in elections, especially in the face of persistent conspiracy theories.",
