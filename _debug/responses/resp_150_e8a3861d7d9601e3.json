  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Palestine solidarity activist, has been released from immigration detention following a habeas corpus petition, after being arrested in March 2025 for activism at Columbia University. The U.S. government seeks to deport him, claiming his advocacy has adverse foreign policy consequences, while civil liberties groups such as the ACLU argue that such actions violate constitutional free speech protections. Khalil is one of the first prominent advocates to face such deportation efforts, and the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists has been deemed unlawful by a U.S. judge, citing violations of free speech rights. The case is now under appeal through both the administrative immigration system and the judicial system, with the Board of Immigration Appeals likely to review the deportation order before possible appeals to a circuit court. The legal saga reflects a larger tension between immigration enforcement and civil liberties in the United States.",
