  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted George Santos’ prison sentence in October 2025, releasing him immediately from federal custody. Santos, a former New York Republican Representative, was expelled from Congress in 2023 after admitting to fabricating personal details and committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Despite being expelled without a criminal conviction, he remained in office until 2023, when the House voted 311-114 to remove him. Trump justified the commutation by comparing Santos’ actions to Senator Richard Blumenthal’s past military service misstatement, though this comparison has been widely criticized. The move is part of a larger trend of executive pardons, including a blanket pardon of over 1,500 individuals connected to the January 6 Capitol riot and a pardon of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. This event raises critical questions about the role of the executive branch in shaping the outcomes of criminal justice cases, especially in politically charged environments.",
