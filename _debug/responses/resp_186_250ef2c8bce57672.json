  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the growing global threat of drones, especially in civilian and critical infrastructure settings. It highlights how technologies like radio frequency jamming (used by MyDefence and others) and low-cost interceptors (like those from Nordic Air Defence) are being developed to detect and disable drones. The war in Ukraine has accelerated innovation in anti-drone systems, while also revealing vulnerabilities in drone defense due to cost disparities. Experts emphasize that early detection, safe neutralization (such as through hacking), and the implementation of drone registration and traffic management systems are essential to address both military and civilian threats. Incidents in Poland, Romania, Germany, and Denmark show that drone threats are no longer limited to conflict zones, prompting governments and private companies to invest in affordable and effective anti-drone solutions.",
