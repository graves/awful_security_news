  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven prominent U.S. universities — including MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, Dartmouth, UVA, and the University of Arizona — have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for adopting ideological policy changes, such as eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and defining gender biologically. The compact, initially sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, demands significant changes to academic governance and student body composition, with enforcement via annual anonymous polls. Universities argue that such demands undermine academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding, which are essential to innovation and free inquiry. The White House claims the agreement would provide priority grants and federal partnerships, but resistance from elite institutions signals broader concerns about government overreach in higher education. The deadline for initial signatories was set for November 21, 2025, with some institutions like the University of Texas at Austin remaining undecided, and others like Vanderbilt only offering feedback. The controversy reflects an ongoing battle between federal policy ambitions and the autonomy of universities as centers of intellectual and cultural freedom.",
