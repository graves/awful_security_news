    "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made claims linking autism to circumcision and acetaminophen, citing two studies — a 2013 and a 2015 study — that show only a weak correlation, not causation.",
    "Neither the 2013 nor the 2015 study established a causal relationship between circumcision, acetaminophen, or autism, and both had significant methodological flaws, including small sample sizes and lack of data on drug use.",
    "The 2025 WPLab preprint paper, which Kennedy referenced, has not been peer-reviewed and is considered speculative; it claims acetaminophen triggers autism, which contradicts decades of scientific research showing acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately.",
    "Acetaminophen is safe for infants and children under medical supervision; no credible research shows it causes autism.",
    "Circumcision is typically elective and performed for religious or cultural reasons, not medical necessity; the procedure is not linked to autism in scientific consensus.",
    "Experts including Helen Tager-Flusberg emphasize that correlation does not imply causation and that confounding variables such as cultural and demographic factors are not accounted for in the studies.",
    "The main study cited by Kennedy (2015 Danish study) only found a 46–62% increased risk in circumcised boys, based on a small number of cases (only 57 boys had both circumcision and autism), and results were not robust or generalizable.",
    "The WPLab paper, authored by researchers from a North Carolina company promoting a link between acetaminophen and autism, has no peer-reviewed validation and is criticized for misrepresenting the scope and findings of earlier studies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing a 2013 and a 2015 study. Experts refute these claims, stating both studies only show weak correlations and do not establish causation. The 2013 study, which analyzed data across nine countries, found a correlation but emphasized methodological limitations and lack of data on acetaminophen use. The 2015 Danish study reported a 46–62% increased autism risk in circumcised boys, but with extremely small sample sizes and significant flaws. A 2025 preprint paper from WPLab, cited by Kennedy, has not been peer-reviewed and is criticized for misrepresenting the studies and promoting a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. Decades of research show acetaminophen is safe for infants when used appropriately and does not cause autism. The article highlights the importance of scientific rigor, peer review, and distinguishing correlation from causation in public health discourse.",
