  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew maintains his residence at Royal Lodge through a 75-year lease agreement with the Crown Estate, where he paid a substantial upfront sum of approximately £8 million in 2003 to cover renovations and effectively eliminate future rent obligations. This financial arrangement, initially seen as cost-effective for the taxpayer due to the property’s disrepair, now faces public scrutiny amid controversy over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations from Virginia Giuffre. Despite the lease requiring ongoing maintenance and upkeep, Prince Andrew is not required to pay monthly rent, and the deal allows his ex-wife and daughters to potentially continue living there. Critics, including government officials and opposition politicians, argue that the arrangement is unjust and that Prince Andrew should pay his fair share or live privately, especially given the public scandals. The National Audit Office has confirmed the deal met financial value standards, but calls for independent review continue to grow, highlighting tensions between royal tradition, financial accountability, and public trust.",
