  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how President Donald Trump has used the National Guard as a tool to advance immigration enforcement, blurring the lines between traditional law enforcement and immigration raids. Despite legal restrictions—such as the National Guard’s inability to make arrests—the troops have been deployed in cities like Chicago, D.C., Memphis, and Oregon to protect ICE agents and support raids. These actions are framed by the administration as efforts to combat crime, but critics, including experts and immigrant communities, argue that they are rooted in the false narrative that undocumented immigrants drive urban lawlessness. The deployments are often carried out against the will of state governors, and have led to significant public fear, confusion, and legal challenges, including court rulings that find such actions violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Historical precedents, such as Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, show a pattern of militarized immigration tactics. The article underscores the growing concern that these actions are not about crime control but about targeted suppression of immigrant populations, with real consequences for community safety and civil liberties.",
