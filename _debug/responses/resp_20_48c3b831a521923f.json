  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified its drone attacks on Ukraine's power and water infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes over 15 days and attacks on Kyiv. These attacks are part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians and prolong suffering, as Ukraine’s energy ministry notes that drones are deliberately circling damaged sites to prevent repairs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responds by turning to Europe for urgent military and financial aid, including air defense systems and long-range missiles. He also advocates for using frozen Russian assets—valued at $200 billion—as funding to purchase Patriot air defense systems. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are considering a $163 billion loan to Ukraine, though Russia disputes the legality of seizing its assets. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government is wary of a potential summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, who is seen as aligned with Russia. Analyst Tatiana Stanovaya observes a pattern: when US pressure on Russia decreases (e.g., after Trump's tone shifts), Russia escalates attacks, suggesting a strategic response to diplomatic backtracking.",
