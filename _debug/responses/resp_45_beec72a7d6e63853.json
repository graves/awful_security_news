  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A yearslong investigation into former Trump national security adviser John Bolton has culminated in a federal indictment on 18 counts of mishandling classified information, stemming from emails shared with his wife and daughter. The probe began in 2020 after concerns over his memoir containing classified content and was reignited in 2021 following a suspected Iranian hack of his email accounts. Despite political pressure from President Donald Trump, who repeatedly called for Bolton’s prosecution, the case was built on technical and legal grounds, supported by career prosecutors including Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara. A search of Bolton’s home and office in August 2025 uncovered documents labeled 'secret' and 'classified,' which were central to the case. The prosecution maintained institutional legitimacy, unlike cases involving politically appointed prosecutors like Lindsey Halligan. The indictment reflects broader concerns about political interference in the justice system, especially as Trump has urged the prosecution of political opponents, including Comey, James, and Schiff, while not directly referencing Bolton in his public messages.",
