  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, beginning around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and resolving by 6 p.m. Eastern time. The outage was caused by a failure in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which disrupted access to a wide range of online services, including social media (Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and educational tools like Canvas. The impact was widespread, affecting students at major universities such as the University of California, Riverside, and Ohio State University, who lost access to coursework and assignments. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages are common, typically due to technical failures rather than cyberattacks, and are often resolved within hours. This event underscores the increasing fragility of modern internet infrastructure, which now relies heavily on a handful of cloud providers like Amazon, making global digital life vulnerable to sudden technical breakdowns.",
