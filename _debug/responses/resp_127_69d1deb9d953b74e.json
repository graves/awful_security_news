Canada leads with 23 non-U.S. players, followed by France and Australia. The Atlanta Hawks tie the NBA record with 10 international players on their roster. The NBA is in active talks with FIBA to launch a new European league as early as 2027, reflecting a strategic push to expand basketball's reach. The last seven MVPs have gone to players born outside the U.S., indicating a shift in global talent dominance.

Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets are highlighted as one of the youngest rosters, lacking any top-100 scorer, while LeBron James continues to break records. A new All-Star Game format is expected, pitting U.S. players against international players in a tournament. The article also notes unique cultural trends, such as multiple players named Jordan, Nikola, and James, and the rare case of Orlando Robinson wearing his first name on the front of his jersey. These developments underscore the NBA’s growing global appeal and transformation into a truly international sport.",
