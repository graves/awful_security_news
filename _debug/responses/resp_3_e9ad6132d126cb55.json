  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military has significantly expanded its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying thousands of troops, naval assets, and advanced aircraft such as F-35s, MQ-9 drones, and B-52 bombers. Key actions include reopening Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, conducting live-fire drills and intelligence missions near Venezuela, and deploying special operations helicopters. While the administration claims the buildup is part of a counter-drug campaign, experts believe it is primarily a pressure campaign aimed at weakening Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The US does not have the force structure for an invasion, but it has the capability to conduct long-range strikes from Caribbean assets. The strategic goal appears to be signaling and coercion, not direct military occupation, given Venezuela’s defensive capabilities and the risks of regional conflict.",
