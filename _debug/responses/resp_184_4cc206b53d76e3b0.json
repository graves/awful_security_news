    "The 'yellow line' in Gaza is a temporary military boundary established under Donald Trump's peace plan, where Israel controls approximately 53% of the Gaza Strip.",
    "The yellow line is seen by Israeli media as 'effectively the new border,' which pleases Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners who support maximalist settlement expansion.",
    "The boundary is fortified, but such fortifications may exacerbate tensions between Netanyahu's domestic allies (who favor hardline actions) and U.S. officials who urge restraint to preserve the ceasefire.",
    "The U.S. has pushed Netanyahu to maintain restraint, especially after Hamas reportedly violated the ceasefire by killing two soldiers; Israel responded with limited air strikes and emphasized attacks inside the yellow line.",
    "Netanyahu insists that the war will end only when Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized, setting conditions for further withdrawals in the second stage of the peace deal.",
    "Washington's tolerance for delays and violations has given Netanyahu less political room than he might desire, creating friction in aligning U.S. and domestic policy goals.",
    "Israeli commentators suggest that key military decisions are increasingly being influenced by U.S. policy, shifting power from Israel's domestic leadership to Washington.",
    "Hardline settlers and ministers hope the yellow line becomes permanent, possibly leading to new settlements or even annexation of Gaza; however, most Israelis prioritize peace and the safe return of hostages and soldiers.",
    "Netanyahu's strategy of keeping options open reflects his political approach—agrees to first stage (withdrawal and ceasefire) to preserve flexibility for future negotiations under the multi-stage Trump plan."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn to a 'yellow line' boundary in Gaza, controlling about 53% of the territory. This temporary line, described by Israeli media as the 'new border,' satisfies far-right coalition partners who support maximalist settlement expansion. However, it creates tension between Netanyahu’s domestic allies, who push for military action, and U.S. officials, who urge restraint to maintain the ceasefire. After Hamas reportedly violated the truce by killing soldiers, Israel conducted limited air strikes and emphasized attacks within the yellow line to show compliance with ceasefire rules. Netanyahu insists that the war will end only after Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized. While the U.S. supports the process, its tolerance for delays and violations has limited Netanyahu’s political leverage, shifting key military decisions to Washington. Israeli commentators suggest that the real influence over military action now lies with U.S. policy, and hardline settlers hope the yellow line becomes permanent, possibly leading to new settlements or annexation. This highlights the complex balance Netanyahu must maintain between domestic political pressure and U.S. diplomatic expectations.",
