  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the U.S. Marine Corps fired a 155mm artillery shell over the I-5 interstate highway, resulting in a premature explosion that sent shrapnel striking a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. The incident, which occurred during a high-profile event attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, raised serious safety concerns, especially given that the route had not been used since the 1950s. The shell was part of a batch produced under a $5.5 billion U.S. investment to support Ukraine’s war effort, and previous manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and a change in explosive type, have prompted scrutiny. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the firing as dangerous and closed the highway in advance, creating a political rift with federal officials. While no injuries were reported, the premature detonation is considered abnormal, even though the shells were fired at high altitudes. Experts, including retired Marine Corps Colonel Mark Cancian, noted that the event, while common for VIP visits, should not have resulted in fragments landing on a vehicle, indicating potential flaws in either the shell or its handling.",
