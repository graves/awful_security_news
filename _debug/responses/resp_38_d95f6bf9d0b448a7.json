    "Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker, stonemason, writer, and public activist, was convicted of terrorism for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico five times in May 2024.",
    "The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that Cintula targeted Fico specifically, not a random citizen, and therefore qualified as terrorism under the law.",
    "Fico, who has held power since 2006, suffered serious injuries, including abdominal, hip, hand, and foot wounds, and has since made public appearances and returned to work.",
    "Cintula claimed he wanted to stop Fico’s policies, which he believed damaged Slovak freedom and culture, and described the attack as a 'scream against fear paralyzing society'.",
    "The defense argued that not all attacks on officials constitute terrorism, but the court concluded that the targeted nature of the attack justified the terrorism classification.",
    "Cintula stated he would appeal the verdict, calling it 'unjust', and the court’s decision reflects deep societal divisions between populist and liberal democratic factions in Slovakia.",
    "Fico has expressed forgiveness toward Cintula, while critics accuse him of undermining democracy through media control, anti-corruption cover-ups, and shifting foreign policy toward Moscow."
