  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Curtis Sliwa, a Republican candidate for New York City mayor, is facing growing pressure from fellow Republicans—including his boss John Catsimatidis and former Governor Andrew Cuomo—to withdraw from the race. Catsimatidis, owner of WABC radio where Sliwa hosts a show, publicly urged Sliwa to step down, citing a need to prioritize New York’s interests. Cuomo, running as an independent, has dismissed Sliwa as a 'shock jock' and argued he is not a viable alternative to Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa has responded by emphasizing his connection to blue-collar voters and rejecting the idea that billionaire donors should dictate election outcomes. He has also dismissed claims that he lacks viability, asserting that he represents the working class. The political dynamics have become increasingly complex, with Sliwa and Mamdani forming an unexpected alliance against donor influence, while Trump mocked Sliwa’s personal interests, calling him 'not exactly primetime'. The situation reflects deep divisions within the Republican Party and growing public skepticism toward elite political influence.",
