The Blue Jays, who outscored the Yankees 34-0 in the ALDS, overcame a strong Mariners lead in the ALCS thanks to a late-game home run by George Springer. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the largest payroll and two World Series titles in recent years, have dominated the postseason, including sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS and showcasing a historic performance by Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers are now set to face the Blue Jays in the World Series, beginning on October 24 in Toronto.

This matchup represents a historic convergence of two top-tier franchises, with significant implications for the future of MLB postseason dynamics.",
