  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge systems—passed down through generations—play a crucial role in predicting and responding to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially when government early warning systems fail or are distrusted. Despite a $37 million investment in early warning infrastructure since 2017, communities remain skeptical due to reported technical failures, lack of community involvement, and poor follow-up. Shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain use traditional signs such as unusual sounds, animal behavior, and signal fires or gunfire to alert villages, successfully saving lives when modern systems fall short. The article underscores the urgent need to integrate local, human-based knowledge into national disaster response strategies, as Pakistan faces increasing climate vulnerability due to rising temperatures and glacier melt, and its communities continue to rely on Indigenous wisdom for survival.",
