  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the planet will experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures — due to climate change. This is a significant improvement from the pre-Paris scenario of 114 superhot days, but still represents a dangerous future. The study reveals a stark global inequity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face massive spikes in heat exposure — with Panama expected to gain 149 extra days — while major emitters such as the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts emphasize that this disparity not only undermines climate justice but could also contribute to geopolitical instability, as vulnerable nations suffer disproportionately despite contributing little to emissions.",
