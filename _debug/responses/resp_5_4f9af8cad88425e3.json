  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans seeking long-term mental health therapy through the VA are facing abrupt termination of one-on-one sessions, despite needing ongoing care for conditions like PTSD. A policy introduced or intensified under VA Secretary Doug Collins, which limits therapy to a fixed number of sessions (typically 8–12), is being enforced without clinical judgment. Providers report facing disciplinary actions for challenging the policy, and many have resigned due to frustration. Veterans such as Michael and Jake Pannell describe feeling abandoned and re-traumatized, especially when sessions end prematurely. The VA denies any systemic limits, claiming collaborative care planning and patient-centered treatment, but providers and experts, including the APA, argue that such limits are clinically inappropriate and undermine trust and recovery. The situation raises concerns about access to equitable, individualized, and recovery-oriented mental health care for veterans with chronic conditions.",
