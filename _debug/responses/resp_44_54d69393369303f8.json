Meta claims its AI characters are designed not to discuss self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating, and teens can only chat with AI characters related to education and sports. This move follows similar safety updates from OpenAI and earlier adjustments to Instagram’s Teen Accounts settings to align with PG-13 content standards. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against AI platforms, including one against OpenAI over a teen suicide, highlighting the growing concern about AI’s emotional impact on youth.",
