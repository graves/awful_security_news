  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on October 20, 2025, due to a failure in its Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented access to critical data stored in DynamoDB and disrupted services across banking, e-commerce, social media, and airline booking platforms. The outage, lasting several hours, affected AWS services including EC2, and raised concerns about the internet’s fragility due to over-concentration of infrastructure in a single provider. Experts attribute the incident to a technical fault, not a cyberattack, and emphasize the lack of redundancy in the current internet model, where widespread dependency on AWS creates cascading failures. This event echoes past outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures, highlighting a growing need for more resilient, decentralized digital infrastructure.",
