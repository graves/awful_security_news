    "Climate change is increasing the number of dangerous 'superhot days' — defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days from 1991–2020 — with the world now expected to add 57 such days annually by 2100.",
    "Before the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, global warming was projected to reach 4°C, which would have led to 114 extra superhot days annually; today, under current commitments, warming is on track for 2.6°C, resulting in 57 extra superhot days annually.",
    "Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days, indicating that climate impacts are already occurring and worsening.",
    "The impact of climate change is highly unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa are projected to face massive increases in superhot days (e.g., Panama: 149 extra days), while top polluters like the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days despite emitting 42% of global CO₂.",
    "This disparity underscores a profound injustice in climate impact distribution, potentially increasing geopolitical tension and deepening global inequality.",
    "Experts emphasize that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by these extreme heat events annually, with thousands already dying in heatwaves each year.",
    "The study uses established climate attribution methods and is not peer-reviewed, but it draws on scientific consensus and accepted modeling techniques to assess climate change impacts."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that, despite progress under the Paris Climate Agreement, the planet will still face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — defined as days warmer than 90% of historical days between 1991 and 2020. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-2015 scenario, which projected 114 such days due to 4°C warming, but still indicates a dangerous level of climate risk. Since 2015, the world has already seen an average of 11 extra superhot days. The study highlights a stark global inequality: small, vulnerable island nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa will face massive spikes in extreme heat — with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days — while major polluters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days, despite emitting 42% of global carbon dioxide. Experts warn that this imbalance could deepen global inequities and trigger geopolitical instability, and that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by these increasingly frequent heatwaves each year.",
