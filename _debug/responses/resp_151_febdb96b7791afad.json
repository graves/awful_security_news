  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Japan’s parliament has elected Sanae Takaichi, a protege of Shinzo Abe, as the country’s first female prime minister, following a last-minute coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party (JIP).

Takaichi’s ultraconservative policies oppose women's advancement, same-sex marriage, and separate surnames, reflecting a rightward shift in Japanese politics. Despite economic optimism and a rise in the Nikkei 225, investor concerns persist due to Japan’s high debt-to-output ratio.
