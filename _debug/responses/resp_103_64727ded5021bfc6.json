  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Pediatrics finds that reversing decades-old advice to avoid peanuts in infants has significantly reduced the incidence of peanut allergies in the U.S., with a 43% drop in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergy rates. This shift, driven by the landmark LEAP study and updated recommendations from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, began in 2015 when health experts realized that early exposure to peanuts—especially in high-risk infants—can prevent allergies. The study analyzed over 120,000 children and found that the change in guidance has prevented at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy over the past decade. Experts note that only about 10% of children who develop a peanut allergy outgrow it, emphasizing the long-term public health benefits. However, challenges remain in full implementation due to parental fears and lack of data on actual eating habits.",
