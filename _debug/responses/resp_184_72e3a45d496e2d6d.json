  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A major fire at Bangladesh's main airport logistics section on Saturday caused extensive damage, with estimates of over $1 billion in losses. The fire destroyed critical goods including raw materials and essential samples used to secure new international buyers, disrupting a sector that accounts for over $40 billion annually in exports and more than 10% of the country’s GDP. The incident occurred during the pre-Christmas rush, when the cargo village—a key logistics hub—was operating at peak capacity. The blaze, which took 27 hours to extinguish, temporarily halted airport operations and injured around 35 people. This is Bangladesh’s third major fire in a week, with two prior incidents involving a deadly warehouse fire and a clothing factory fire in Chittagong. Conspiracy theories suggest a possible link between the events, raising concerns about sabotage or arson, particularly given a history of political exploitation of such tragedies. The interim government has promised firm action if credible evidence of foul play is found. Experts attribute the frequency of fires to poor infrastructure and weak safety enforcement, with hundreds of deaths recorded in recent years.",
