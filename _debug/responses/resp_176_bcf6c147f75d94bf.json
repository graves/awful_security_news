  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the health crisis in Gaza is a 'catastrophe' that will persist for generations due to famine, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, and widespread mental health issues. While a ceasefire brokered by the United States has created a temporary pause in hostilities, aid deliveries remain critically insufficient—only 200 to 300 aid lorries per day reach Gaza, far below the required 600. Israel controls access points like Kerem Shalom and Kissufim but has restricted or confiscated humanitarian supplies, including materials needed to build field hospitals, citing dual-use concerns. The situation is further exacerbated by halted medical evacuation flights, which have left thousands of Palestinians, including 700 who have died waiting, without life-saving care. The UN estimates $70 billion is needed to reconstruct Gaza, with 10% dedicated to health recovery. Dr. Tedros stresses that aid must be delivered without conditions, especially after the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and the transfer of only 15 of 28 deceased hostage remains. He calls on Israel to open all access routes and allow previously denied aid groups to operate, emphasizing that peace is the best medicine, but the fragile ceasefire has been broken multiple times and continues to result in loss of life.",
