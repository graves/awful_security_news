    "Nicolas Sarkozy, a former French president, is the first in living memory to be imprisoned after a conviction for criminal conspiracy related to financing his 2007 election campaign with Libyan funds.",
    "The conviction is significant because it represents a rare instance where a former head of state faces criminal penalties, shaking public trust in political immunity.",
    "Sarkozy will serve his sentence at La Santé prison in Paris, which has housed high-profile inmates such as Captain Alfred Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal.",
    "Despite maintaining his innocence, Sarkozy is being imprisoned immediately without awaiting appeal due to the 'seriousness of the disruption to public order' as ruled by a Paris judge.",
    "He will be allowed to bring only 10 family photos, three books (including 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and a biography of Jesus Christ), and is expected to be held in a 9-square-meter cell, possibly in a 'vulnerable' section with special provisions.",
    "Former inmates such as Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological and physical shock of incarceration, emphasizing the loss of status and privacy.",
    "Sarkozy has expressed defiance, saying he will 'hold his head high' in prison and continue to fight legally until the end.",
    "He will be able to request release to the appeals court only after being behind bars, with a two-month processing window.",
    "The prison system's handling of high-profile inmates — including security protocols and cell conditions — reflects broader societal debates about fairness, due process, and the treatment of political figures in criminal justice."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, the former President of France, is set to become the first in living memory to be imprisoned after being convicted of criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 election campaign. Despite maintaining his innocence, a Paris judge ruled that he must begin serving a five-year sentence immediately, without waiting for appeal, due to the seriousness of the offense and its disruption to public order. He will be held at Paris’ La Santé prison, historically known for housing high-profile inmates like Captain Alfred Dreyfus and Carlos the Jackal. Former inmates such as Pierre Botton and Patrick Balkany describe the psychological and physical shock of incarceration, including the loss of status and privacy. Sarkozy will be confined to a 9-square-meter cell, possibly in a 'vulnerable' section with limited amenities, and will be allowed to bring only 10 photos and three books, including 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. He has expressed defiance, stating he will 'hold his head high' and continue legal challenges. His wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and son Louis have publicly supported him, and he will only be able to request release to the appeals court after being incarcerated, with a two-month processing window. This case is significant as it marks a rare instance of political accountability for a former head of state and raises broader questions about the treatment of leaders in criminal justice systems.",
