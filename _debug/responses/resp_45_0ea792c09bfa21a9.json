  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted that Ukraine make territorial concessions—specifically, the surrender of parts of the eastern Donbas region—in exchange for a ceasefire. This marked a shift from Trump’s earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. Trump reportedly raised his voice and emphasized a ceasefire at current battle lines, citing the 'realities of the conflict' and the devastation caused. While Zelensky expressed pessimism and later endorsed the ceasefire idea, Ukrainian officials downplayed the meeting as negative, calling it a constructive dialogue. Trump denied asking for a full surrender of Donbas, stating that 78% of Ukraine's land is already under Russian control. The episode follows a prior phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a territorial swap involving Donbas and southern regions. The meeting is seen as part of a broader effort by Trump to end the war quickly, influenced by his success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. U.S. officials are concerned that such demands could undermine Ukrainian military efforts and prolong the suffering of civilians.",
