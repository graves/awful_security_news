  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes began on October 6 with the awarding of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough with potential applications in cancer and autoimmune disease treatments. The announcement sequence continues through October 13, with the science and literature prizes having been awarded in previous years. The article highlights the prestige and global significance of the Nobel Prizes, established by Alfred Nobel’s will to recognize individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humanity. It also addresses political controversies, particularly regarding claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he deserves the 2025 Peace Prize, which experts argue are inconsistent with the committee's focus on durable peace and institutional action. The article further emphasizes the scientific milestones of past laureates, including breakthroughs in machine learning, protein structure prediction, and literary expression, while underscoring concerns about the impact of political interference on academic freedom, as noted by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",
