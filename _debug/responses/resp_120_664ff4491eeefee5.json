  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing — the traditional base of operations for the First Lady — to build a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees such projects. President Donald Trump announced the project, claiming it fulfills a 150-year presidential desire and is necessary because the East Room is too small. He asserts that the construction will not cost taxpayers and is privately funded by business leaders and 'Patriots,' including Carrier Global Corp., which has donated an HVAC system. The White House argues that demolition and site prep fall outside the commission's jurisdiction, citing that it only regulates vertical construction. However, the project has raised significant concerns about executive overreach, transparency, and the historical value of the East Wing, which will be temporarily relocated. The ballroom is expected to be completed by January 2029, marking the most significant structural change to the White House since 1948.",
