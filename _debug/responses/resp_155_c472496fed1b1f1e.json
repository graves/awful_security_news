Hanegbi, who served since 2023, called for a thorough investigation into the failures that led to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, admitting shared responsibility, while Netanyahu’s government has not yet established a formal inquiry. In his place, Gil Reich, the deputy head of the National Security Council, has been appointed as acting head. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who argue it reflects a broader pattern of political evasion and replacement of accountable officials with loyalists.",
