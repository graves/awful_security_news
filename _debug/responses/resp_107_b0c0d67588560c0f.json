However, regional variations are evident, with China's economy expected to slow to 5.2% due to internal challenges and reduced investment. In contrast, the U.S. faces inflationary pressures, prompting the Federal Reserve to maintain a restrictive monetary policy. At the same time, there is a significant global shift towards renewable energy, with solar and wind power projected to supply 40% of new energy capacity by 2025. Despite these positive developments, ongoing trade tensions between major economies, especially in technology and supply chains, pose a persistent risk to global economic stability. This dynamic landscape underscores the complexity of current economic trends and the need for strategic planning across industries and nations.","tags":["Economy","Growth","China","United States","Renewable Energy","Solar Power","Wind Power","Inflation","Trade Tensions","Technology","Sustainability"],"timeOfPublication":"20:45:30Z","title":"Global Economic Outlook: Growth, Challenges, and the Rise of Renewable Energy in 2023"}
