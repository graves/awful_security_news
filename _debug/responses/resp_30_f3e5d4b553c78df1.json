    "The plane had not flown since March 25, 2025, after being flown from Mexico to Michigan, suggesting potential maintenance or system issues.",
    "Preliminary flight data shows a sudden increase in descent rate — reaching 24,000 feet per minute — within minutes of takeoff, indicating a possible aerodynamic stall or control failure.",
    "This incident mirrors a similar crash in February 2024 involving another Hawker 800XP during a post-maintenance test flight, where two pilots were killed while testing the stall warning system.",
    "Duncan Aviation, the maintenance company, confirmed that the flight was a post-maintenance test flight, and two pilots and one maintenance representative were killed.",
    "The crash occurred during a test flight after scheduled maintenance, with the pilots reportedly attempting a stall recovery, and no response from air traffic control after multiple attempts.",
    "Publicly available tracking data shows the aircraft climbed to 15,000 feet before rapidly descending, with the entire descent lasting about one minute."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP business jet crashed near Lansing, Michigan on October 17, 2025, during a post-maintenance test flight, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative. Air traffic control audio shows the pilots repeatedly requesting stall recovery, and the plane descended rapidly — reaching 24,000 feet per minute — before crashing in woods. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation. This incident mirrors a similar 2024 crash involving the same aircraft model during a stall warning test flight, raising concerns about aircraft safety systems and maintenance protocols. Flight tracking data confirms the plane departed Battle Creek Executive Airport at 5:08 PM and crashed within 20 minutes, with descent lasting about one minute. The crash highlights recurring risks in business jet operations and underscores the need for improved stall warning and pilot response systems.",
