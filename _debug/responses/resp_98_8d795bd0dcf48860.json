  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines, under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) around 3:50 a.m. local time after arriving from Dubai. The Boeing aircraft broke in two upon impact, colliding with an airport security patrol car and pushing it into the sea, resulting in the deaths of two occupants. The four crew members were treated for injuries, and no cargo was on board. The incident occurred without any distress signals from the pilots, and the airport has suspended operations on its north runway while emergency responders, including over 200 personnel, worked to manage the situation. Despite the severity of the accident, the airport's operations remained largely unaffected due to the continued use of two other runways. The event is notable in the context of HKIA’s strong safety record, with only one major fatal crash in 1999 involving a China Airlines flight during a typhoon, underscoring the rarity of such incidents at this major international hub.",
