  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven major U.S. universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a White House proposal that offers expanded federal research funding in exchange for implementing ideological policy changes such as eliminating sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes. The compact, which includes mandatory annual compliance polls, was initially sent to nine universities on October 1, 2025, and later expanded to include three additional schools. Universities argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition, warning that tying funding to ideology undermines the innovation and integrity of higher education. While the University of Texas at Austin has expressed openness to dialogue, the majority of institutions emphasize their commitment to self-governance and free inquiry, marking a significant resistance to federal control over academic institutions.",
