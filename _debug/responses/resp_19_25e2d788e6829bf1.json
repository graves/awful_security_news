  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to the northern Caribbean, particularly to Hispaniola, where heavy rainfall—potentially over a foot—could trigger dangerous flash flooding and mudslides in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. A hurricane watch is in place for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may also face rain-related impacts. While a direct hit on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, there is a low but non-zero chance, especially if the storm takes a northward turn. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season and the first to form in the Caribbean, highlighting an active and warming hurricane season linked to climate change and rising sea temperatures. The storm’s track remains uncertain, with two primary scenarios: one moving north toward Hispaniola and another drifting west toward Central America. Recent patterns of rapid intensification in hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto suggest that Melissa may follow a similar trajectory. Historical examples like Hurricane Nicole and Hurricane Zeta reinforce that late-season storms can still impact the U.S., emphasizing the need for vigilance as the hurricane season continues into November.",
