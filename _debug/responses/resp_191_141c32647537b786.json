  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is undergoing a major boardroom shake-up with seven members—including chairman Helge Lund and vice chairman Henrik Poulsen—stepping down due to a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The foundation, which holds a three-quarter voting stake despite owning only 28.1% of shares, advocated for a more extensive reconfiguration than the board proposed, leading to the resignations. The company's share price dipped 1.7% after the announcement, reflecting investor concern over governance instability. This comes amid rising competition from Eli Lilly, a decline in profit growth forecasts, and prior leadership changes, including the removal of former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen in May 2024. Lars Rebien Sorensen, former CEO and current foundation chairman, is being proposed to replace Lund, suggesting a return to leadership with deep historical ties to the company.",
