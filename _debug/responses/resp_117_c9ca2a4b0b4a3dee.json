    "New Jersey is experiencing a close gubernatorial race in November 2025 between Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite being a historically blue state in presidential and Senate elections.",
    "The race is notable for its personal attacks, including Ciattarelli's claim that Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation in 1994, and Sherrill's allegations that Ciattarelli's medical publishing company downplayed opioid dangers and caused tens of thousands of deaths.",
    "Former President Barack Obama endorsed Sherrill, while President Donald Trump endorsed Ciattarelli, adding national political significance to the race.",
    "The campaign is heavily influenced by affordability concerns, with voters focusing on rising energy costs and property taxes, especially after a 17–20% surge in electricity bills in June 2025.",
    "New Jersey has a history of purple gubernatorial elections, with no governor elected from the same party for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. If Sherrill wins, it would be the first such instance since 1960s.",
    "The race has become increasingly polarized, with both candidates leveraging personal and policy narratives, and Ciattarelli's campaign threatening legal action against Sherrill for defamation.",
    "Polling shows a close margin, with one poll indicating a tie, despite Democrats holding a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the upcoming November 2025 gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is in a closely contested race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Despite New Jersey's traditionally blue political leanings, the race is considered 'purple' due to its history of alternating party control. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is backed by former President Barack Obama and is criticized by Ciattarelli for being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation in 1994. Ciattarelli, a pro-Trump politician and former state assembly member, is endorsed by President Donald Trump and has faced accusations from Sherrill of downplaying opioid risks and causing mass deaths. Both candidates are engaging in heated personal attacks, with Ciattarelli's campaign threatening defamation lawsuits. Voter concerns center on affordability, including a 17–20% surge in electricity costs in June 2025, and policy proposals around housing and energy prices. While Democrats hold a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage, the race remains tight, with polling showing a tie in one recent poll. If Sherrill wins, it would mark the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey has elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms.",
