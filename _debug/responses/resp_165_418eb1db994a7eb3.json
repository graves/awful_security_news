    "A Slovak court convicted 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula of a 'terror attack' and sentenced him to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024.",
    "Cintula claimed his actions were driven by 'moral despair' and a desire to protest government policies, including the halt of military aid to Ukraine.",
    "The prosecution reclassified the shooting as a 'terror attack' due to political motivation, shifting from a premeditated murder charge.",
    "Prime Minister Robert Fico has repeatedly accused liberal opposition and media of inciting the attack, without evidence, and has since pursued increasingly authoritarian policies.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Slovak court has sentenced 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula to 21 years in prison for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024, classifying the act as a 'terror attack' due to political motivation. Cintula, from Levice, claimed he was driven by 'moral despair' and sought to protest government policies, particularly the halt of military aid to Ukraine. The prosecution reclassified the shooting from premeditated murder to terrorism, citing political intent. Prime Minister Fico, who returned to work after the attack, has accused the liberal opposition and media of inciting the incident, while his government has since pursued increasingly authoritarian policies—cracking down on media, NGOs, and cultural institutions, and criticizing EU sanctions and Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. Slovakia passed a constitutional amendment limiting same-sex couples’ rights and asserting national law over EU law, deepening political polarization. Cintula’s defense described his actions as a manifesto for those disillusioned by political corruption, and his lawyer has indicated an appeal, highlighting ongoing legal and political controversy.",
