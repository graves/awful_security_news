  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Youth-led protests, primarily by Generation Z, have successfully toppled political leaders in multiple countries including Madagascar, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. In Madagascar, President Andry Rajoelina was ousted by a convergence of Gen Z protests and military action, resulting in the military commander Michael Randrianirina assuming power. While Bangladesh saw a peaceful transition replacing Sheikh Hasina with a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Madagascar’s movement highlights a more unstable path involving military intervention. The article notes that similar youth movements are emerging in Africa, such as Morocco’s GenZ 212 movement and Kenya’s protests over taxation and cost-of-living issues. Experts warn that African leaders, especially those in long-ruling or military regimes, must be wary due to rising youth political consciousness, widespread youth unemployment, and frustration with corruption and poor governance. As the continent has the world’s youngest population, youth-led uprisings may become more frequent and impactful, with potential to inspire renewed activism in countries where protests have previously stalled.",
