The Trump administration is urging the Court to reinstate a case against Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man convicted of possessing a gun while being a regular marijuana user. A lower court ruled the blanket drug-user gun ban unconstitutional, citing the Supreme Court’s 2022 test that requires firearm restrictions to have strong historical grounding. Hemani’s legal team argues that such a ban risks criminalizing millions of Americans, given that over 20% of U.S. adults have used marijuana. The Justice Department counters that regular drug users pose a public safety risk, pointing to FBI evidence of drugs and a gun found in Hemani’s home. Arguments are expected in early 2026, with a decision likely by early summer 2026, making this one of the most significant flashpoints in the ongoing debate over gun rights and drug policy in the United States.",
