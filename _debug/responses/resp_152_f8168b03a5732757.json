  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, stating that these models provide a highly distorted and polarized view of politics. Testing revealed that the AI systems frequently recommended fringe parties such as the Party for Freedom (PVV) and the Green Left-Labour Party, while largely ignoring centrist parties like Democrats 66 and the Christian Democratic Appeal. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of democratic elections, as voters may be misled into supporting ideologically extreme parties. The authority urges both voters and AI providers to avoid using such tools for political decision-making, emphasizing the lack of transparency and verifiability in AI-generated advice. This comes in the context of the upcoming parliamentary election on October 29, where the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is expected to win the most seats despite not securing a majority, due to a political consensus among mainstream parties against supporting it.",
