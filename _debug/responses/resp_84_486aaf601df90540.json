    "The US-made Tomahawk missile is a proven, effective, and relatively inexpensive weapon system with a range of 1,600 to 2,500 kilometers and high precision, making it a key tool in U.S. military operations in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and against Iranian nuclear sites.",
    "Ukraine currently lacks access to Tomahawk missiles due to logistical, political, and strategic constraints, including the absence of a ground-based launcher (Typhon) and limited U.S. stockpiles.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the US-made Tomahawk cruise missile as a proven, high-precision, long-range weapon used in multiple conflicts, including Iraq, Syria, and against Iran. Despite its effectiveness and low cost, Ukraine currently cannot access Tomahawk missiles due to lack of a ground-launched system (Typhon), limited U.S. stockpiles, and political resistance from the Trump administration, which prioritizes domestic needs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for Tomahawk delivery to enable strikes on deep Russian targets such as the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, arguing it would strengthen Ukraine’s position in negotiations. Russia has responded with warnings of escalation, citing the Tomahawk’s potential nuclear capability, while Ukraine's own Flamingo missile remains unproven and unscalable. The article concludes that while Tomahawks could inflict significant damage, Ukraine's real need is more effective air defense systems to counter Russia’s drone and missile attacks.",
