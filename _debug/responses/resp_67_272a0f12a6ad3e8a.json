  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a high-profile Gaza ceasefire deal attributed to President Donald Trump, American public opinion shows little enthusiasm for the agreement, with approval ratings on the deal remaining flat or declining. Trump’s overall approval, especially on domestic issues like inflation and the economy, has dropped to some of his lowest levels in his second term. Polls indicate that Americans are more concerned about economic issues such as rising prices and job insecurity than foreign policy outcomes. This reflects a broader public sentiment that foreign policy achievements, such as peace deals, are less impactful than economic well-being, with only a small fraction of Americans prioritizing international events as a top national concern. The fragility of the Gaza deal and past short-lived ceasefire agreements further reinforce skepticism about the durability of peace efforts in the region.",
