  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre Museum in Paris was breached in a daylight heist on Monday, October 20, 2025, when four armed suspects used power tools to break into the Galerie d'Apollon, cutting through windows and display cases to steal eight 19th-century royal jewels including diadems, necklaces, and brooches. The gang, believed to be acting under organized criminal direction, was inside for just four minutes before escaping on two scooters. French authorities report that one in three rooms in the area lacked CCTV, and the local alarm was reportedly disabled. The stolen items, including Empress Eugénie’s crown (found damaged), are of immense heritage value. The incident has triggered widespread national and political outrage, with officials like Macron, Bardella, and Le Pen calling it an attack on France's cultural soul. Experts warn that the thieves will likely break up and sell the jewels to conceal their crime. This follows a recent pattern of museum thefts in France, including attacks on the Adrien Dubouche and Cognacq-Jay museums. The Louvre remains closed, with investigations ongoing, and officials are reviewing security systems as part of a broader push to modernize museum safety, including the planned €700–800 million 'New Renaissance' project.",
