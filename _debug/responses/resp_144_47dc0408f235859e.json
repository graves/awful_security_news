  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "North Korea conducted multiple short-range ballistic missile launches just one week before the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. The missiles, which flew approximately 350km and fell inland, are seen as a provocative act intended to assert the regime’s presence and nuclear capabilities during a major international diplomatic event. Experts interpret the timing as a deliberate effort by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to signal strength and defiance, especially amid growing diplomatic activity involving China, the U.S., and South Korea. The launches mark the first such activity under South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae Myung, and follow previous missile tests five months earlier. The U.S. and South Korea have heightened military readiness, with joint surveillance and coordination, as North Korea continues to reject international arms bans, claiming self-defense against perceived threats from the U.S. and South Korea. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed interest in future talks with Kim Jong Un, though North Korea insists on maintaining its nuclear arsenal in any agreement.",
