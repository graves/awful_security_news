  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has voluntarily stepped back from using his royal titles, including Duke of York, amid continuing allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir details claims of trafficking and forced sex. The claims have prompted investigations by the Metropolitan Police and renewed debate over whether the monarchy should legally remove titles linked to abuse. While the King emphasizes duty and community service, especially after visiting victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, political figures like Rachael Maskell and Flynn advocate for legal reform to allow the monarch to directly remove titles, citing public demand and the need to address historical wrongs. The situation is further complicated by US documents revealing possible contacts between Epstein and Prince Andrew, and by the loss of titles by Sarah Ferguson. Though the UK government has declined to intervene, constitutional experts note pathways for title removal, including Letters Patent or parliamentary action. The controversy remains a focal point as the royal family seeks to maintain public focus on service and victims, rather than on scandal.",
