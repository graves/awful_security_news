Preliminary findings from the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet the safety specifications set by CARRIS, the funicular’s operator, and that maintenance logs falsely indicated compliance despite incomplete or non-performed tasks. Eyewitnesses described the derailment as chaotic and terrifying. While the interim report is not final, it highlights serious systemic failures in cable integrity, maintenance procedures, and safety oversight, raising concerns about public transport safety in urban environments.",
