  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge systems — such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, heavy rainfall, or roaring sounds — are being relied upon by local communities to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are increasing due to climate change. Despite significant investments in early warning systems (EWS) like the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems are ineffective and poorly trusted due to frequent malfunctions, lack of real-time communication, and poor community engagement. In contrast, shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have successfully saved lives by using traditional human-based signals such as gunfire and fire, demonstrating the resilience and reliability of local knowledge. Pakistan, ranked among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, faces mounting climate risks, with nearly 90 GLOFs between 2019 and 2022. Experts, including the UNDP and World Bank, highlight broader systemic challenges like financial constraints, data gaps, and weak institutional capacity. This highlights a critical need for integrating traditional Indigenous knowledge with formal systems to build trust, resilience, and effective disaster response.",
