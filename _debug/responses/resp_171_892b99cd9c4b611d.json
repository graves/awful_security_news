    "Top emitters like the U.S., China, and India—responsible for 42% of global CO2—face only 23–30 additional superhot days, indicating a stark inequity in climate impacts.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that climate change has already added 11 average superhot days since 2015 and will result in 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 under current commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement. This is half the increase from a worst-case scenario of 114 days under pre-Paris warming. The study reveals a sharp inequity in climate impacts: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa—accounting for less than 1% of global carbon emissions—will face the largest spikes in dangerous heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days. In contrast, the world’s top emitters, including the U.S., China, and India, which are responsible for 42% of global CO2, will experience only 23–30 extra superhot days. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequalities and threaten geopolitical stability, emphasizing that tens of thousands or millions of people will be affected by rising heat events, even as climate action has not eliminated the risk of catastrophic warming.",
