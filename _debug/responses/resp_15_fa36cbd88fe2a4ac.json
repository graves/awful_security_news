  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently experiencing a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass the 12 required appropriations bills. This follows the 2018–2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days — the longest in nearly 50 years — and cost an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The previous shutdown was partial, with 800,000 federal employees affected, including 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted from pay. The current shutdown reflects deep political gridlock, exacerbated by a narrow Republican majority in the House and a lack of Senate votes to overcome a filibuster. With no funding agreement in sight, federal services are being disrupted, highlighting systemic challenges in U.S. legislative cooperation.",
