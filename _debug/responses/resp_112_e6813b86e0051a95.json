  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warns that public pressure will force Congress to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025. With subsidies set to expire and premiums expected to surge by as much as $2,000 per month — potentially reaching over $24,000 annually — millions of Americans, especially those earning below $63,000, face unaffordable health costs. Jeffries opposes a Republican proposal for a one-year subsidy extension, arguing that it fails to address the broader crisis of Medicaid cuts and elite tax breaks, and instead prioritizes billionaire benefits. He highlights that such policies could lead to mass insurance cancellations and the closure of vital health care providers. In contrast, Jeffries supports full government operations and military pay but opposes Republican legislation allowing President Trump to unilaterally decide who gets paid during the shutdown, calling it a lawless and politically motivated ploy. The article underscores the urgency of bipartisan action during a critical period of health care and fiscal instability.",
