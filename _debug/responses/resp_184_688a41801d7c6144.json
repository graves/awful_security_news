  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, France's first former president to go to jail, begins a five-year prison sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 presidential campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Though not personally implicated in receiving funds, he was convicted of criminal association with aides Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, who arranged secret financial links via intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine. The case, known as the Bygmalion affair, has sparked intense public and political debate. Sarkozy is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, where he faces restrictive conditions including limited contact, exercise, and privacy. Despite filing an appeal and maintaining his innocence, the judicial system has upheld the conviction due to the 'exceptional seriousness' of the facts. The incident has raised broader questions about political accountability, judicial fairness, and the treatment of former leaders in the criminal justice system.",
