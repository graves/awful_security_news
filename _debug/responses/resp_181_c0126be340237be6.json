  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 'No Kings' protests in October 2025 saw massive, peaceful demonstrations across major U.S. cities, driven by public anger over President Donald Trump’s use of executive power, immigration policies, tariffs, and government shutdowns. While the Democratic Party lacks control of Congress, the scale of turnout suggests a potential for political resurgence, especially in upcoming state and midterm elections. Democratic leaders are grappling with internal divisions—between progressives and centrists—and are balancing confrontation with Trump over the shutdown against the need for bipartisan compromise. Though the protests are symbolic, they signal a broader shift in public sentiment. The November state elections may determine whether anti-Trump sentiment translates into electoral support, while next year’s midterms could grant Democrats real institutional power to check Trump’s authority. However, deep ideological fractures within the party—such as those seen in primary battles in Maine, Massachusetts, California, and Michigan—pose challenges to unity and effectiveness.",
