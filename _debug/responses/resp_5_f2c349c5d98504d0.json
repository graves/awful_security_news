  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a rapid summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the White House now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. This follows a previous phone call where Trump expressed a desire for a meeting within two weeks, but subsequent diplomatic talks between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov failed to produce alignment, particularly on key issues like ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Officials note that Lavrov lacks real influence on major decisions and is largely a proxy for Putin, undermining the value of high-level bilateral meetings. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that Russia has reduced diplomatic interest due to the U.S. not providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, framing military capability as central to peace. Despite the collapse of the summit timeline, Trump remains committed to brokering peace in Ukraine, and future diplomatic discussions may occur at a regional ASEAN gathering. The article highlights a significant shift in U.S.-Russia diplomatic strategy, emphasizing indirect communication and the growing importance of military capabilities in peace negotiations.",
