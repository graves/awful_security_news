    "Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party.",
    "Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, secured 54.5% of the vote, while Quiroga received 45.5%, according to early electoral tribunal results.",
    "Paz’s party (PDC) won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, outpacing Quiroga’s coalition (43 seats in lower house, 12 in Senate), but lacks a legislative majority, requiring coalition-building to govern.",
    "The election followed a deepening economic crisis in Bolivia, including falling natural gas exports, 40-year high inflation, and fuel shortages, which fueled voter dissatisfaction with the MAS-led model.",
    "Paz’s moderate platform, emphasizing private sector-led growth and gradual reform, appealed to left-leaning voters disillusioned with MAS but wary of Quiroga’s austerity measures and IMF-backed cuts.",
    "Both candidates pledged stronger diplomatic ties with the United States, with Paz unveiling a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal to secure fuel supplies.",
    "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the shift, calling the election a 'transformative opportunity' for improved U.S.-Bolivia relations after decades of anti-American policies.",
    "Paz’s running mate, Edman Lara, a former police officer with viral TikTok anti-corruption content, boosted the campaign's appeal among younger and working-class voters.",
    "Paz plans to phase out universal fuel subsidies, replacing them with targeted support for vulnerable groups and market rates for industries like agribusiness, to allow market adjustment.",
    "The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including securing fuel supplies, stabilizing the economy, and avoiding labor opposition from the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), which opposes any threats to social gains.",
    "The election marks a political turning point, with analysts viewing it as a sign of Bolivia transitioning to a new stage of democracy in the 21st century."
