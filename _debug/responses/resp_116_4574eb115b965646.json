  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, over 500 volunteers, including 27 from New York, organized a bipartisan citizen lobbying effort in Washington, D.C. to advocate for increased cancer research funding, expanded cancer screening access, and continued federal health insurance subsidies. Despite deep political divisions, individuals such as Mary Catherine Johnson, Lexy Mealing, and Katie Martin — who all survived or lost loved ones to cancer — transcended political differences, emphasizing that 'cancer doesn't care' about party affiliation. The volunteers, wearing matching blue polo shirts and carrying red folders, visited 484 congressional offices, achieving bipartisan support for research and screening, though some Republican lawmakers resisted insurance subsidy extensions. The event culminated in a candlelight vigil on the National Mall honoring 10,000 individuals affected by cancer, underscoring the emotional and human impact behind the advocacy. The story highlights how shared personal experiences can bridge political divides and serve as a powerful force in public health policy.",
