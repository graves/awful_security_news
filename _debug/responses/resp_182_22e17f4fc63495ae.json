The meeting followed a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who agreed to meet in Hungary, raising questions about whether the discussions are aimed at de-escalation or strategic brinkmanship. Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about a ceasefire along current front lines and suggested Ukraine could offer drones in exchange for the missiles. Despite the lack of a commitment, both leaders emphasized the importance of diplomacy and protecting lives, with Zelensky urging European allies to strengthen unity and support Ukraine’s security. The event underscores ongoing geopolitical tensions and the complex balance between military escalation and diplomatic negotiation in the ongoing Ukraine conflict.",
