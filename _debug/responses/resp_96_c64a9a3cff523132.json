  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During his second term as U.S. president, Donald Trump is applying his business and branding strategies from the Trump Organization to the federal government, turning the White House into a personalized brand. This includes launching initiatives like TrumpRx, a prescription drug website; a high-cost immigrant visa called the Trump Gold Card; a proposed Trump coin; and a new fighter jet named F-47. The MAGA slogan has become a broader political identity, used in merchandise and public discourse. Trump has also rebranded White House spaces, such as the Rose Garden into the Rose Garden Club, and streamlined social media to post more quickly, sometimes with controversial or offensive content. While these strategies are effective in capturing attention and creating emotional appeal, critics argue they violate longstanding norms of political governance by commodifying government functions and prioritizing personal branding over public service. Though not illegal, such practices raise ethical concerns about the influence of personal identity on public policy and democratic institutions.",
