  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A prolonged government shutdown in the United States, now in its third week and tied for the second-longest in history, has deepened political and public frustration. Federal workers—including nuclear security specialists and air traffic control staff—are being furloughed or fired, while critical nutrition support for 42 million Americans is set to expire. Democrats are using the crisis to push for extended Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing that without them, health insurance costs will surge. Republicans, however, remain resistant to talks, blaming Democrats and advocating for reform of the ACA while refusing to extend subsidies. Internal divisions within both parties—such as Republican dissent on a worker-pay bill and public protests targeting Trump—reflect the failure of compromise. Despite efforts by leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to pass stopgap measures, Democrats have blocked all such votes, maintaining the shutdown. President Trump has only allocated funds to military and FBI personnel, ignoring broader civilian workforce impacts. The political deadlock persists, with no signs of resolution before Thanksgiving, and leaders failing to shift from blame to negotiation.",
