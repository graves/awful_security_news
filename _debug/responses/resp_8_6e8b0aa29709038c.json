  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, due to potential rainfall exceeding one foot, leading to flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, Puerto Rico and Florida could face some impacts from rainfall and rough seas. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean Sea, where warming waters are fueling more intense and rapidly intensifying storms. Forecasters are monitoring two primary tracks: one turning north toward Hispaniola and another moving west toward Central America. The storm's development underscores broader trends in climate change, where warmer ocean temperatures are increasing the frequency and severity of rapid intensification in hurricanes.",
