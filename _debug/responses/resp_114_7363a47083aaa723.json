  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins is demanding that President Trump remove the use of his song 'Danger Zone' from a fake AI-generated video posted on Truth Social, which depicts Trump in a fighter jet labeled 'KING TRUMP' dumping sludge over protesters in Times Square. The video, posted in response to the 'No Kings' protests, features Loggins' performance without permission, which he claims is unauthorized and divisive. Although the use of music in political content is generally legal with proper compensation, many artists object to its politicization. This incident is part of a broader pattern of musicians, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, filing copyright suits against Trump over political misuse of their work. The White House has not directly addressed Loggins’ request, instead sharing a 'Top Gun' film still with a caption referencing speed. The controversy underscores tensions between political satire, artistic rights, and public unity in the current political climate.",
