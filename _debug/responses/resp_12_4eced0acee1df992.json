  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As President Donald Trump intensifies pressure on Venezuela, the US military has deployed B-52 bombers near the Venezuelan coast, authorized covert CIA operations targeting drug trafficking and migration, and conducted multiple strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has mobilized nationwide military forces under the 'Independence 200' campaign, claimed to have over 8 million militia members, and denounced US actions as regime-change conspiracies. The Trump administration has tied Maduro’s regime to drug traffickers and cartels, framing this as a national security threat, while legal experts and internal military officials question the legality and proportionality of the actions. Meanwhile, Venezuela's government has enacted a state of emergency decree to consolidate power, and civilians express widespread anxiety, with some engaging in peaceful protests. The situation reflects a tense, escalating standoff between the US and Venezuela, with significant implications for regional stability, international law, and civilian safety.",
