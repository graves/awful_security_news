  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Gaza ceasefire agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is progressing better than expected, with US Vice President JD Vance visiting Israel to reinforce its implementation. Despite a recent Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and triggered Israeli military strikes, both sides have reiterated their commitment to the truce. Vance and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pushing for long-term negotiations, including the creation of an interim Palestinian government, deployment of an international stabilisation force, Israeli troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. However, significant challenges remain: only 13 of 28 deceased Israeli hostages have been returned, and humanitarian aid delivery is severely limited to just two crossings (Kerem Shalom and Kissufim), with food shortages in northern Gaza. The World Food Programme reports that while over 6,700 tonnes of food have been delivered, access remains restricted and daily targets are not met. Israel has responded to the attack with a large-scale bombing campaign, claiming Hamas breached the ceasefire. Hamas has affirmed its commitment to the deal and hostage return, though it faces logistical challenges in recovery efforts. The fragile peace underscores ongoing tensions and the risk of renewed violence, especially if either side fails to meet core obligations.",
