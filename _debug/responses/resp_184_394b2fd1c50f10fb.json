  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a national survivor of a US military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling submarine in the Caribbean, because the Ecuadorean authorities found no evidence of criminal activity. The Colombian survivor, Jeison Obando Pérez, suffered a severe injury and is being treated in Bogotá. The US, led by President Donald Trump, claims the strike targeted a 'drug-carrying submarine' loaded with fentanyl, part of a broader counter-narcotics campaign involving around 10,000 troops and multiple military assets since September. However, experts question the legality of the strikes under international law, especially given that fentanyl primarily enters the US from Mexico, not the southern Caribbean. The US blames Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro for leading the Cartel of the Suns, which Maduro denies, while Colombian President Gustavo Petro calls the strike in Colombian waters a 'murder' and accuses the US of aggression. Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago supports the US military operations, citing regional peace goals. The incident raises significant concerns about the proportionality, legality, and humanitarian impact of military actions in international waters.",
