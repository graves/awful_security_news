While both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement, Israel accused Hamas of attacking forces in Rafah beyond the Yellow Line, and Hamas denied involvement, claiming it was targeting Israel-backed militias. The conflict escalated with violence in Gaza, including a public execution and ongoing searches for hostages, while aid deliveries were temporarily paused but later resumed, indicating the ceasefire's humanitarian components remain in place. Key figures such as Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and Benjamin Netanyahu are involved in diplomatic efforts to maintain the deal, while domestic pressure in Israel mounts over perceived backdowns. The situation remains volatile, with the Rafah Crossing still closed and full resolution of the hostage issue pending.",
