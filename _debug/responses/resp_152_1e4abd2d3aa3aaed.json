  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have reached an immediate ceasefire following a week of deadly cross-border violence along their 2,600km border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The agreement, brokered in Doha, commits both nations to stop attacks, respect sovereignty, and establish follow-up talks in Istanbul on October 25. Pakistan blames Afghan soil for the resurgence of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has conducted over 600 attacks in the past year and surged in violence in 2025. The Taliban has denied providing safe havens for the TTP, but analysts like Elizabeth Threlkeld and Abdullah Baheer question the feasibility of curbing cross-border militant activity due to porous borders and the independent nature of groups like the TTP. While the ceasefire represents a diplomatic breakthrough, skepticism remains over its sustainability, especially since key militant actors are not bound by the agreement and the Taliban's ability to control them is doubted.",
