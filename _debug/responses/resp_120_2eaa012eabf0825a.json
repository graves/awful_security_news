  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial showed that early peanut introduction in infants reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that this public health strategy has had a measurable real-world impact. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in U.S. children aged 0 to 3 have declined by more than 27%, and by over 40% after expanded recommendations in 2017. The research, led by Dr. David Hill and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records from pediatric practices and found that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since the guidelines were implemented. The original LEAP trial by Gideon Lack at King’s College London demonstrated that early exposure reduced allergy risk by over 80%, with long-term protection in about 70% of children. Despite initial resistance, adoption of the 2021 updated guidelines—advocating for peanut introduction between 4 and 6 months of age without screening—is now gaining traction among pediatricians and parents. Advocacy groups like FARE support these changes as a key strategy to reduce food allergy prevalence nationwide, emphasizing that even small exposures to allergens like peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, or tree nut butters can safely help train the immune system.",
