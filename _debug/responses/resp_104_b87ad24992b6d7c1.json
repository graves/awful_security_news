  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the theory of 'enshittification,' a concept coined by internet activist and author Cory Doctorow, which describes how internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber evolve from user-friendly services into exploitative, profit-driven systems. Doctorow outlines a three-stage model: Stage 1 sees platforms attract users with generous incentives and high-quality services; Stage 2 shifts focus to business customers, using user data to manipulate feeds and subsidize business operations; Stage 3 marks the peak of enshittification, where platforms extract maximum profit through predatory pricing, junk fees, algorithmic manipulation, and distorted search results. The theory is grounded in a lack of competition and weak regulatory oversight, allowing companies to build high switching costs and network effects that protect their profits. Doctorow cites studies showing Amazon’s search results are skewed, with the best match located 17 places down and first results being 29% more expensive. Amazon and Facebook deny the claims, with Amazon asserting that its value has improved and fees are optional. The article calls for policy reforms, including stronger antitrust enforcement, a shift from the consumer welfare standard to a user-harm-focused model, and increased interoperability and 'right-to-exit' regulations to empower users and reduce platform dominance.",
