  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House has begun demolishing part of the East Wing to construct a $250 million glass-walled ballroom for President Donald Trump, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal building projects. The project, which will accommodate up to 999 people, is being privately funded by Trump and wealthy donors, including Carrier Global Corp., which has donated an energy-efficient HVAC system. While the White House claims the ballroom will not interfere with the main structure and will respect historical integrity, the demolition has sparked controversy over regulatory compliance and the displacement of the first lady’s offices. Construction began in October 2025, with plans for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029, and the East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during the project.",
