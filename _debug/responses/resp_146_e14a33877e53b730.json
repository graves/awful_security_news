  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bosnia’s Republika Srpska has appointed Ana Trisic Babic as interim president, marking the first formal recognition that Milorad Dodik is stepping aside after being barred from politics by a state court. Dodik, a pro-Russian nationalist who repeatedly defied the international envoy Christian Schmidt and challenged the authority of the Dayton Accords, had refused to vacate office despite a conviction and a six-year political ban. The Republika Srpska parliament annulled separatist laws passed under Dodik and confirmed Babic’s leadership until early presidential elections on November 23. The US Treasury removed four of Dodik’s allies from sanctions, a move he welcomed, while international bodies and domestic courts continue to emphasize the importance of upholding the Dayton peace agreement. This development reflects broader tensions over national sovereignty, constitutional compliance, and regional stability in post-conflict Bosnia.",
