Discovery, the parent company of CNN, is considering a sale after receiving multiple expressions of interest from potential buyers, including Paramount and Skydance. The company's board has initiated a review of strategic alternatives, which could include a full sale, a split into Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, or other restructuring options. CEO David Zaslav has long advocated for a split to unlock greater value, but Paramount’s initial offer—described as a lowball—was rebuffed. Market speculation has led to a significant spike in WBD stock, and the company remains open to various strategic paths to maximize its asset value.",
