  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the current surge in cowboy imagery across American media, fashion, and politics, noting that this trend is deeply tied to conservative cultural values and political rhetoric. While popularized by 19th-century performances like the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows and later reinforced by Western films and Hollywood icons, the modern cowboy image is largely mythologized and sanitized. It is used by political figures like Donald Trump and George W. Bush to promote individualism, patriotism, and resistance to urban liberalism. Despite this, the article highlights the historical erasure of Mexican, Native, and Black Americans in cowboy narratives. Recent efforts—such as Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' album, the rise of Black rodeo culture, and photography projects like Gabriela Hasbun’s 'The New Black West'—are helping to diversify and reclaim the narrative. However, mainstream media and political discourse still largely rely on white, romanticized versions of the cowboy, demonstrating a pattern of cultural whitewashing. The article concludes that the cowboy is not a reflection of reality but a powerful cultural symbol that reflects national identity, political ideology, and enduring myth-making.",
