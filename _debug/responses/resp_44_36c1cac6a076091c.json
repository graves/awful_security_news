This follows a previous incident in July when the U.S. summoned its ambassador in Bogotá. The conflict centers on allegations that the U.S. supported a plot to remove President Gustavo Petro from power, and on U.S. missile attacks on seven vessels suspected of drug trafficking, resulting in at least 30 deaths, some of whom may have been Colombian nationals. President Donald Trump has accused Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombian goods. The actions have intensified regional and global concerns about drug policy, state sovereignty, and the use of military force in international affairs.",
