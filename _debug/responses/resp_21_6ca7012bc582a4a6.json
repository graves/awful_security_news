  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has identified the body of deceased Israeli hostage Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023. Haimi, a 41-year-old military officer, was among the 13 deceased hostages identified since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9, 2025. His body was retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza, transferred to Israeli forces, and identified through forensic examination. The identification process is part of a broader effort under the ceasefire agreement, which requires Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours. However, Israeli intelligence believes Hamas may not be able to locate and return all remaining bodies due to extensive war damage in Gaza. A prior body transfer was found to be misidentified, raising concerns about the accuracy of the process. The US, led by President Donald Trump, has threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the ceasefire, and US officials, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have held direct talks with Israeli military leaders to ensure compliance. The Knesset has affirmed that returning all deceased hostages is a non-negotiable part of the ceasefire, underscoring the ongoing diplomatic, humanitarian, and political challenges of implementing the agreement.",
