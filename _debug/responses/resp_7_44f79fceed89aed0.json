  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Israeli military reported that two coffins containing the remains of deceased Israeli hostages crossed into Israel from Gaza under the terms of a US-proposed ceasefire agreement signed on October 9, 2025. The bodies were handed over by Hamas, with prior custody held by the Red Cross, and are now being identified at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine. This marks the 14th and 15th deceased hostages to be returned since the ceasefire began, following the return of 13 previously identified bodies, including Sergeant Major Tal Haimi. Hamas has admitted that significant challenges — including rubble and missing bodies — make recovery difficult, and one prior body was misidentified, raising concerns about accuracy. The Israeli military and public are urged to wait for official identification. US Vice President JD Vance emphasized the difficulty of the recovery process, noting that some bodies are buried under rubble and that the task will take time. The broader implications of the ceasefire deal’s implementation, including Hamas’s compliance and the return of all deceased hostages, remain under active scrutiny.",
