  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China's Five Year Plans, long-standing strategic frameworks set by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have fundamentally reshaped the global economy. Beginning with Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 'reform and opening up' policy, China transitioned from state-controlled central planning to a market-driven economy, leading to the rise of Special Economic Zones and a global manufacturing shift known as 'the China shock'. This economic transformation accelerated further after China joined the WTO in 2001, prompting a strategic pivot toward 'strategic emerging industries' such as electric vehicles and solar panels, which now position China as the world leader in green technology. The country’s near-monopoly on rare earth supply chains has given it significant geopolitical influence, especially in AI and chip-making. As Western nations impose restrictions on Chinese technology, China has responded by shifting to 'new quality productive forces'—a strategy emphasizing technological self-reliance, national security, and domestic innovation. This shift, led under Xi Jinping, signals a new phase in China's economic policy where technological independence is central, with domestic successes like Huawei, TikTok, and DeepSeek demonstrating its growing global technological power. The article underscores how China’s long-term planning model contrasts with Western political cycles, and how its economic decisions have driven global trade, political tensions, and geopolitical realignments.",
