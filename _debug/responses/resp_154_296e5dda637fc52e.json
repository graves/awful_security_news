  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike in the southern Tunisian city of Gabes, led by the powerful UGTT labour union, shut down key economic and public facilities in response to a long-standing pollution crisis linked to the state-run CGT phosphate plant. Residents have accused the plant, opened in 1972, of causing widespread health issues, including respiratory illness and cancer, and ecological damage such as marine collapse and radioactive waste dumping. Despite a 2017 government pledge to shut it down, authorities increased production, calling phosphate a 'pillar of the national economy'. Over 200 people have been hospitalized, and protests have intensified, with demands for immediate closure. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination', while activists claim that even local food now tastes like smoke. Chinese companies have been brought in to help manage emissions, but public anger remains high as the crisis tests political and environmental accountability in Tunisia.",
