  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, 68, was sentenced to death by firing squad in Indonesia in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 with 3.8 kg of cocaine hidden in her suitcase, claiming she was coerced by a drug gang threatening her children. The case drew international attention due to her advanced age and health, and she was spared execution through a repatriation agreement signed between the UK and Indonesia in October 2025. Another foreign national, Shahab Shahabadi, a 35-year-old Iranian man serving a life sentence for methamphetamine trafficking, was also included in the deal. The agreement was facilitated by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Indonesia’s Senior Minister of Law Yusril Ihza Mahendra. Indonesia, under President Prabowo Subianto, has repatriated several foreign prisoners under bilateral agreements, reflecting both a human rights response and a broader diplomatic trend. The country holds around 100 foreign prisoners on death row, many for drug-related crimes, despite being a major drug smuggling hub. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlights Indonesia’s role in drug trafficking, emphasizing global concerns about strict drug laws and human rights violations.",
