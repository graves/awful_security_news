  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS cloud outage on October 21, 2025, disrupted critical UK services like Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns over over-reliance on US tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. With both AWS and Azure holding 30–40% of the UK and European cloud market, the incident exposed the fragility of 'nested dependencies' in digital infrastructure. Experts warn that assuming these platforms are inherently resilient is a mistake, and while switching providers is costly and difficult due to data integration and scale, the risks of monopolistic dominance are real. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has flagged market concentration as a problem and recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to enforce competition. In response, the UK government, including Lord Leong, is working with AWS to improve resilience and promote greater participation from UK and European cloud providers, advocating for a more open, competitive, and sovereign cloud ecosystem.",
