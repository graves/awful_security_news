  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, bringing heavy rainfall and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high. The storm is forecast to pass near the island, where over 9,000 people have already moved to safer areas. This evacuation is part of a routine drill, as Catanduanes is one of the first landmasses affected by western Pacific cyclones. The Philippines, already reeling from a series of earthquakes and typhoons, including a magnitude 6.9 and 7.4 quake and Typhoon Ragasa, is increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, which is intensifying storm activity. Experts warn that rising global temperatures are contributing to stronger and more frequent storms, placing immense pressure on disaster management systems in the region.",
