    "The 2025 Nobel Prizes began with the awarding of the Physiology or Medicine Prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.",
    "The Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist, to honor individuals who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.",
    "Each prize is awarded by a specific institution: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry, economics), the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet (medicine), the Swedish Academy (literature), and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).",
    "The prizes are formally presented on December 10 each year, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death, with ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo.",
    "The nomination process is highly secretive, with experts, academics, and past laureates invited to submit nominations by January 31 each year. Nominations are not public, and committee members are prohibited from discussing decisions for 50 years.",
    "The 2024 Nobel Prizes were awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun (medicine), John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton (physics), David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper (chemistry), Han Kang (literature), Nihon Hidankyo (peace), and Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson (economics).",
    "The 2025 medicine prize is expected to build on previous work, especially in immunology and autoimmune disease treatment, with potential implications for global health strategies.",
    "The 2025 Peace Prize is under intense public scrutiny, with speculation involving U.S. President Donald Trump due to his public claims about deserving the prize for ending wars, though experts note such claims are unlikely due to the prize’s focus on durable peace and institutional efforts.",
    "Concerns have been raised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences about political interference in science, particularly under the Trump administration, which may threaten academic freedom and the integrity of the nomination process."
