  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man, Ian Cleary, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman, Shannon Keeler, at Gettysburg College in 2013. After nearly 12 years, the case was revived when Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you' in 2019, prompting Keeler to re-engage prosecutors. Cleary was extradited from France in 2024 after being detained in Metz on a vagrancy charge. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, sentenced Cleary to a reduced term due to his guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. Shannon Keeler, who had been waiting for justice for over a decade, described the case as a moment of long-overdue accountability, citing the destruction of evidence and the system's failure to act. The case underscores broader systemic failures in prosecuting campus sexual assault, where victims often face delays, lack of support, and loss of evidence.",
