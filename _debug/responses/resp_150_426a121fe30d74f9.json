  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine coast, over 9,000 residents of the island of Catanduanes have evacuated due to risks of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high and strong winds of up to 80 km/h. The evacuation is part of a recurring drill, as Catanduanes is often among the first landmasses affected by cyclones in the western Pacific. The Philippines, which faces an average of 20 typhoons annually, is still recovering from a recent series of major earthquakes and typhoons, including a 6.9 and a 7.4 magnitude quake, which caused fatalities and triggered tsunami warnings. Scientists warn that increasing storm intensity is linked to global climate change, indicating a growing threat to vulnerable, impoverished communities in disaster-prone regions.",
