  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump's peace plan, Israel has withdrawn its forces to a 'yellow line' in Gaza, effectively controlling about 53% of the territory, marking the first stage of a three-phase military withdrawal. This boundary, described by an Israeli newspaper as 'effectively the new border,' is seen by Netanyahu’s far-right coalition as a potential foundation for settlement expansion. While the US, including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, urges restraint and maintains the ceasefire to preserve the peace process, Israel has responded to Hamas violations with limited strikes and a reaffirmation of the truce to avoid direct conflict. Netanyahu insists that the war will continue until Hamas is fully disarmed, but growing influence from US policy and domestic public demand for peace suggest that Israel’s military and political decisions are increasingly shaped by external diplomacy. The sustainability of the yellow line as a de facto border depends on resolving the complex issues of Hamas disarmament and power transfer in Gaza during the next stage of negotiations.",
