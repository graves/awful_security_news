  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the federal government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million workers have been furloughed or are working without pay, leading to widespread financial hardship. Federal employees, including contractors from the Department of Commerce and Social Security Administration, are turning to community food banks like the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries for basic food supplies. A surprise surge of more than 370 households seeking aid—twice the expected number—reveals the depth of the crisis. The event, organized by a religious group, highlights both the personal toll on workers and the growing strain on civil society. While Republican Senator Ron Johnson proposes paying only those working during the shutdown, Democrats advocate for universal pay. The article underscores a fundamental shift in public perception: federal jobs are no longer seen as secure, and the shutdown is exposing the fragility of public employment and the vital role of community support during national crises.",
