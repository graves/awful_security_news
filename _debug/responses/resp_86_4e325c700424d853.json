  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Justice Department is challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s role as lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, alleging that Fitzgerald may have been involved in the improper disclosure of classified information in 2017. The prosecutors argue that communications between Comey and Fitzgerald contain evidence of such disclosures, claiming a potential conflict of interest. However, Fitzgerald and Comey’s team counter that the memos were unclassified at the time they were shared, and the government’s later upclassification does not negate that. The dispute raises significant legal questions about whether a person who is both a witness and a defense counsel can fairly represent a client in a high-profile political case, and it reflects broader tensions between executive power, transparency, and legal ethics.",
