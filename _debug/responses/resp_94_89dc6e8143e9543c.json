  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, convenes the fourth plenum to chart the country’s economic and political course through 2030, emphasizing technological innovation and economic security amid escalating tensions with the United States. The meeting comes at a critical time as China’s economy slows—its Q3 growth fell to 4.8%—due to external trade friction and internal challenges like overcapacity and weak consumer demand. A major anti-corruption purge within the military, including the removal of General He Weidong and Miao Hua, signals Xi’s tightening grip on party and military leadership. While the new five-year plan is expected to maintain Xi’s current strategy with a focus on high-quality development, it may include targeted measures to address domestic overproduction and stimulate consumption. The event also occurs just before a potential meeting between Xi and US President Donald Trump in South Korea, underscoring the geopolitical significance of China’s internal political decisions.",
