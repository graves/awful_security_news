  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "South Korean police are seeking warrants for 58 of 64 repatriated nationals from Cambodia, who are accused of involvement in 'pig butchering' scams—fraudulent operations involving fake romantic relationships and cryptocurrency investments. These scams, reportedly targeting victims globally, have led to the trafficking of South Korean citizens through false job offers, with approximately 1,000 believed to be currently operating in Cambodian scam centres. The repatriations follow public outrage after the August 2025 killing of a South Korean college student, who was found dead after being kidnapped and tortured. South Korea has responded by sending a diplomatic and law enforcement delegation to Cambodia, banning travel to certain areas, and intensifying investigations. Internationally, the US and UK have imposed sanctions on the Prince Group, a Cambodia-based crime network running scam centres, while Japan has arrested individuals linked to similar operations, showing a coordinated regional response to this growing cybercrime and human trafficking crisis.",
