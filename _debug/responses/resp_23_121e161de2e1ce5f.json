Her election follows the LDP’s loss of its long-time coalition partner Komeito and a political realignment with the opposition Japan Innovation Party. She has pledged to boost the economy through tax cuts and spending, but faces significant domestic challenges such as inflation, a shrinking workforce, and declining birthrates. Takaichi also opposes same-sex marriage and the use of separate surnames, reinforcing her conservative ideology. With US President Donald Trump scheduled to visit, she vows to strengthen Japan-US relations and rebuild public trust in a party facing deep crisis and declining popularity.",
