  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Eileen Collins made history as NASAâ€™s first female spacecraft commander and pilot, breaking gender barriers in spaceflight. She joined the astronaut program after training as a test pilot in the U.S. Air Force and commanded a Space Shuttle mission in 1995, becoming the first woman to pilot one. Her career included leadership during the tragic Columbia disaster in 2003 and a daring 360-degree maneuver in 2005 to inspect the shuttle's heat shield after foam debris was detected. Demonstrating courage and determination, she piloted the craft through a risky flip to allow inspection, ultimately ensuring the safety of the crew. Collins balanced being a mother, a working wife, and a high-level astronaut, embodying resilience and leadership. Her legacy is now being highlighted in the documentary 'Spacewoman,' which showcases her trailblazing journey and inspires future generations, especially women in STEM.",
