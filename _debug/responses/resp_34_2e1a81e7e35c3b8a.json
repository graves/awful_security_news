  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel has transferred 120 Palestinian bodies to Gaza under a ceasefire agreement, with the bodies marked only with numbers and showing signs of torture, including binding, blindfolding, gunshot wounds, and broken bones. The origin of the deaths is unclear — whether in Gaza during the war, in Israeli detention centers like Sde Teiman, or during the October 7, 2023, attacks. Palestinian forensic experts and the International Committee of the Red Cross are examining the remains at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Some bodies show signs of being exhumed or buried. Experts like Dr. Lawrence Owens have concluded that the victims were likely bound and blindfolded before death. Families, such as Rasmiya Qdeih, are searching through the remains to identify missing relatives, especially those not involved in the attacks. The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons has criticized Israel for not releasing victim names or death circumstances, raising concerns about enforced disappearances and data manipulation. Israel has not disclosed details about the 360 bodies it claimed were 'terrorists,' and reportedly refuses to return the bodies of Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and his brother. The lack of transparency and the graphic nature of the remains have fueled international scrutiny and human rights concerns.",
