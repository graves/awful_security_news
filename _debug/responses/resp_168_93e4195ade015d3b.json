  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Hamas has returned the bodies of 15 deceased Israeli hostages, including Arie Zalmanowicz and Master Sgt (res) Tamir Adar, who were killed during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack. The bodies were transferred via the International Committee of the Red Cross and delivered to Israeli military forces, where they will be formally identified in Tel Aviv. The return of these remains is part of a broader deal that includes the release of over 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and a partial military withdrawal from Gaza. However, Israel has expressed outrage over Hamas’s failure to return all deceased hostages, citing difficulties in locating bodies amid destroyed buildings. The situation remains tense, with violence flaring up over the weekend and accusations of breaches of the ceasefire. The article underscores the human cost of the conflict, with over 68,000 killed in Gaza since the initial attack, according to Hamas-run figures.",
