  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In May 2024, 72-year-old Juraj Cintula attempted to assassinate Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Handlova, shooting him five times and causing serious injuries. The Specialized Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica ruled that Cintula committed a terrorist act, not just a political attack, based on his deliberate targeting of the prime minister. The court sentenced him to 21 years in prison, a decision that reflects both the severity of the act and the legal distinction drawn between terrorism and general political violence. Cintula claimed he opposed Fico’s policies on Ukraine, media, and culture, describing the attack as a 'scream against fear'. The case has exposed deep societal divisions in Slovakia, with Fico blaming opposition-led polarization and the opposition accusing him of undermining democracy. Fico has forgave Cintula, while the defendant plans to appeal the verdict, calling it unjust. The verdict underscores tensions between political extremism, democratic norms, and public safety in Slovakia.",
