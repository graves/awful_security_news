  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York, was released from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for fraud charges. Santos claims the prosecution was not political and that he has learned valuable lessons, calling his time in solitary confinement a 'very large slice of humble pie.' Despite criticism from fellow Republicans like Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino, who argue the crimes were serious and that justice was not served, Santos asserts he has no remorse and that the investment made to win a political race was legitimate. He has been released from all financial and legal obligations, and while he is now focusing on prison reform and personal redemption, he has stated he will not return to politics in the next decade.",
