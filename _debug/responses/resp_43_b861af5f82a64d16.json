This incident follows a long history of security and operational failures, including a 2019–2024 audit revealing persistent delays in updating security systems and uneven implementation of renovations. The museum has also faced chronic issues such as overcrowding, water damage, temperature fluctuations, and poor staff conditions, which were highlighted in a 2025 internal memo by Louvre president Laurence des Cars. The theft is the latest in a series of incidents, including the 1911 'Mona Lisa' theft and the 1983 loss of 16th-century armor. In response, French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for a dedicated room for the 'Mona Lisa' as part of a 10-year renovation.
