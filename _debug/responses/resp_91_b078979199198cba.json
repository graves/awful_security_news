  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a pivotal 2025 postseason matchup, the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-2 to force a Game 7 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS). Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth home run of the playoffs, including a solo shot in the fifth inning, while Seattle’s defensive lapses—such as two consecutive fielding errors in the second inning—led to early runs. The Mariners managed one run in the sixth via Josh Naylor’s homer and a single by Randy Arozerana, but a wild pitch from Matt Brash in the seventh allowed Guerrero to score and sealed the victory. The Blue Jays’ win marks their first Game 7 since 1985 and the second in franchise history, while the Mariners become the first team in their history to play a Game 7. The winner will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.",
