  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using titles such as Duke of York following renewed public and political pressure related to his alleged connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she had sexual encounters with him when she was 17. Despite stepping down from public royal duties after a controversial 2019 BBC interview and paying millions in a 2022 out-of-court settlement, Andrew still technically holds the title of Duke of York. Public outrage, including from opposition figures like Scottish lawmaker Stephen Flynn and Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts, has led to calls for formal removal of his titles through parliamentary action. The Metropolitan Police are investigating claims that Andrew in 2011 asked a bodyguard to investigate Giuffre’s criminal record, raising concerns about attempts to smear her. Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' reveals that Andrew allegedly treated her as if sex was a 'birthright' and sought to impose a one-year gag order on her. Questions also remain about the financial sustainability of Andrew’s residence at Royal Lodge, which he rents from the Crown Estate. The article highlights ongoing tensions between public accountability and the constitutional role of the monarchy, especially as the royal family prepares for a state visit to the Vatican.",
