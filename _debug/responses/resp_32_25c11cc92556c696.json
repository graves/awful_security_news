  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, was spared execution in Indonesia under a bilateral repatriation agreement signed between the UK and Indonesia in October 2025. She had been imprisoned since 2012 after being arrested at Bali’s airport for carrying 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, claiming she was coerced into smuggling by a drug gang threatening her children. Her death sentence was upheld by Indonesia’s highest court in 2013. Another British national, Shahab Shahabadi, is serving a life sentence in Jakarta for methamphetamine trafficking. The UK and Indonesia agreed to repatriate both individuals, with the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Indonesia’s Senior Minister of Law Yusril Ihza Mahendra signing the deal. This repatriation follows a trend under President Prabowo Subianto’s administration of sending foreign prisoners home. Indonesia, despite having some of the world’s strictest drug laws, hosts over 530 death row inmates—nearly 100 of whom are foreigners—and has not executed anyone since 2016. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes Indonesia’s role as a major drug smuggling hub, raising global concerns about human rights and capital punishment in drug cases.",
