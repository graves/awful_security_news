  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Misty Copeland, the first Black woman principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre and a trailblazer for racial and gender inclusion in ballet, is retiring after a storied career. Her farewell gala, featuring performances including a world premiere by Kyle Abraham and tributes from Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen, celebrates her legacy. Copeland’s rise challenged longstanding norms in a field historically dominated by white dancers, and her advocacy — including efforts to diversify digital representation and launch the Misty Copeland Foundation — has inspired a new generation of Black ballerinas. While progress has been made, such as India Bradley becoming the first Black woman soloist at New York City Ballet, structural disparities remain, with no other Black women achieving principal status at major companies. Her impact extends beyond performance, reshaping how ballet is perceived and who is seen as eligible to participate.",
