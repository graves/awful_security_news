  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recent Russian drone attack on Ukraine’s Chernihiv region, including the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, at least four civilians were killed and 10 injured, with extensive power and water outages affecting hundreds of thousands. The attacks targeted key energy infrastructure, and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately circling drones to hinder repairs and inflict terror through cold weather. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia’s tactics as murderous and deceptive, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was criticized for feigning peace efforts while launching attacks. The incident reflects a broader pattern of Russian targeting of Ukrainian energy facilities since February 2022. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to end the war, including a proposed meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin, were canceled due to lack of scheduling or preparedness. Ukrainian and European leaders firmly rejected any territorial concessions, insisting on the preservation of Ukraine’s current borders and the integrity of international law.",
