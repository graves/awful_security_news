  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US Vice President JD Vance reports that the Gaza ceasefire agreement is progressing better than expected, despite recent violence and tensions. The truce, brokered by former President Donald Trump, remains fragile due to Hamas’s failure to return all deceased hostages and continued attacks that triggered Israeli retaliatory strikes. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are pushing for negotiations on a long-term peace plan that includes an interim Palestinian government, international stabilization force, troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament. Israel insists on full compliance with hostage recovery before entering long-term talks, while the World Food Programme warns that only limited aid is reaching Gaza due to restricted crossings and ongoing hostilities. Despite Hamas claiming commitment to the ceasefire and the return of some hostages, including Tal Haimi’s body, concerns persist about the stability of the truce and the potential for renewed conflict.",
