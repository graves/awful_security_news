  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in October 2025 that there is a link between autism and circumcision, citing two studies — one from 2013 and one from 2015 — that show a correlation. However, experts emphasize that neither study proves causation, that the studies have significant methodological flaws including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use, and that the 2025 WPLab preprint cited by Kennedy is unpeer-reviewed and not scientifically credible. Acetaminophen, used in some post-circumcision pain management, is considered safe when used as directed, and no research supports a link to autism. The article highlights the danger of misrepresenting scientific findings, especially when political figures amplify unverified claims to influence public health decisions.",
