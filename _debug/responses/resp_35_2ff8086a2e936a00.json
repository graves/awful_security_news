  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US Navy detained two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, marking the first time the Trump administration has held prisoners from such an operation. This action, confirmed by President Donald Trump and involving the CIA and US Southern Command, is part of a broader strategy to disrupt drug trafficking and pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The operation raises significant legal questions, including whether the administration has the constitutional and legal authority to conduct lethal strikes and detain individuals without due process, especially as drug trafficking is traditionally treated as a criminal matter, not a war crime. Experts and lawmakers have challenged the legality, citing the lack of congressional authorization for war and the precedent set by prior administrations. Detainees may pursue habeas corpus claims to challenge their detention, potentially exposing the administration's legal justifications.",
