  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on October 20, 2025, affecting critical online services such as banking, shopping, social media, and airline booking for several hours. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from accessing AWS-hosted databases like DynamoDB and virtual servers like EC2. While AWS does not frequently face such disruptions, the incident highlights a fundamental vulnerability in today’s internet: its heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud providers. Experts note that the internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient, but current architecture is centralized, so a failure in one region leads to widespread, immediate impact. Past outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures, reinforce the idea that internet infrastructure is fragile and susceptible to cascading failures. The outage underscores the urgent need for better redundancy, diversified cloud usage, and improved system resilience to protect global digital operations.",
