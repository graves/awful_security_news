  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s Attorney General Kris Mayes has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Representative Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit asserts that the Constitution does not allow the Speaker to deny a duly elected member office simply because the House is in recess. Johnson claims he is following a precedent established by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stating he will administer the oath upon the House’s return to regular session. However, the lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s delay is politically motivated—aimed at avoiding a petition for Epstein-related records and strengthening his position in budget negotiations. This case raises critical constitutional questions about the power of the Speaker to control the seating of elected officials.",
