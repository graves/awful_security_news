    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes — three individuals of the Culiseta annulata species — found in Kiðafell, near Reykjavík.",
    "The discovery marks the first instance of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment, distinguishing it from a previous isolated case involving a single mosquito on an airplane at Keflavík International Airport.",
    "Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia, and is adapted to cold climates by surviving winter in sheltered areas.",
    "The exact mechanism of introduction to Iceland remains unclear, with theories suggesting arrival via ships or shipping containers.",
    "Scientists emphasize that while climate change may facilitate future mosquito expansion, it is not confirmed as the direct cause of this specific discovery.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson caution that climate change may have increased the likelihood but do not establish a direct link, noting limited knowledge about mosquito range shifts in currently warming regions.",
    "This discovery raises broader concerns about how rising global temperatures could expand mosquito habitats and increase disease risks worldwide."

The discovery, made by citizen Björn Hjaltason and verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, marks a significant ecological shift. While the exact route of introduction remains unclear, theories point to maritime transport. The species is native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to survive winter in sheltered areas. Experts note that although climate change may have increased the potential for future mosquito expansion, it is not definitively linked to this discovery. The event underscores broader concerns about climate change enabling the spread of disease-carrying insects globally, even in traditionally inhospitable regions like Iceland.",
