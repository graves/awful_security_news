    "Enshittification is a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the degradation of internet platforms into inferior, profit-driven systems.",
    "Doctorow outlines three stages of enshittification: Stage 1 (early growth, user-friendly platforms), Stage 2 (favoring business customers at user's expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization through user and business exploitation).",
    "Examples of enshittification include Facebook's data-driven feeds, Amazon's allegedly predatory pricing and junk fees, and search result manipulation.",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, particularly the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law.",
    "He proposes policy solutions such as 'right-to-exit' regulations (e.g., allowing Kindle users to transfer e-books) and interoperability standards (e.g., enabling cross-platform compatibility).",
    "Amazon and Facebook have responded to the claims, with Amazon stating that its practices are not predatory and that its value has improved over time."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses Cory Doctorow’s theory of 'enshittification,' a process by which internet platforms degrade from user-friendly, open systems into exploitative, profit-driven environments. Doctorow outlines three stages: Stage 1 (user-focused growth), Stage 2 (business customer favoritism), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at the expense of users and merchants). Platforms like Facebook and Amazon are cited as examples, with Facebook altering feeds to promote ads and Amazon allegedly charging junk fees that reduce merchant profits. Doctorow blames the lack of competition and weak antitrust regulations — especially the consumer welfare standard — for enabling this degradation. He proposes solutions such as right-to-exit regulations and greater interoperability between platforms to restore user control and competition. Amazon and Facebook have responded, denying the claims and asserting their platforms have improved over time. The article underscores a growing public and policy movement to reverse enshittification through stronger regulation and user rights.",
