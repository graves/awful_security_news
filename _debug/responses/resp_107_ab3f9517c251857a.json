  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York who was expelled from Congress in 2023 for fabricating personal and financial details to deceive donors. Santos pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, beginning his sentence in July 2024. Trump announced the commutation on October 18, 2025, citing political loyalty and comparing Santos’ deception to past misstatements by Senator Richard Blumenthal. The move follows a pattern of Trump's executive actions, including pardons for figures like former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and over 1,500 individuals linked to the January 6 Capitol attack. This event reflects broader tensions over executive power, political accountability, and the treatment of political figures convicted of fraud.",
