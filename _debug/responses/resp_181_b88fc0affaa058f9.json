  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new marine species — a semi-transparent porcelain crab using hair-like structures to feed and a glowing lantern shark found over 600 meters below sea level — during a 2022 expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia. These discoveries highlight the rich but unexplored biodiversity of Australia’s deep oceans, where over 600 more species are estimated to remain undiscovered. The findings underscore the importance of deep-sea exploration in advancing scientific knowledge of marine life and the unique adaptations of organisms in extreme environments.",
