The court examined cases involving state surveillance and technology-driven monitoring, emphasizing that such practices must be justified and proportionate. It held that indiscriminate or unconsented surveillance violates the right to privacy and that the state must have a legitimate reason and a transparent process to conduct surveillance. The court also stressed the importance of establishing a legislative framework to regulate the use of technology in surveillance, ensuring that any state action remains within constitutional boundaries. This judgment has significant implications for digital privacy, law enforcement, and the balance of power between the state and individuals in India.","tags":["Indian Constitution","Fundamental Rights","Privacy Rights","Surveillance","Digital Rights","Judicial Decisions","Constitutional Law"],"timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Affirms Fundamental Right to Privacy in Surveillance Cases"}
