  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven prominent U.S. universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Dartmouth, and Brown, have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for significant policy changes. The compact, which demands the removal of sex and ethnicity from admissions, a 15% cap on international enrollment, and ideological standards for gender definitions, is framed by the administration as a way to promote a 'vibrant marketplace of ideas.' However, universities argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding — foundational to innovation and global competitiveness. The White House claims that signatories would gain priority in grant allocations and access to federal events, but the backlash from elite institutions underscores a broader struggle over the role of federal influence in higher education. While some universities like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, the majority have rejected the compact, signaling strong resistance to ideological mandates in academic governance.",
