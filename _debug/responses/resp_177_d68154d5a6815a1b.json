  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Massive anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests took place across the United States on 19 October 2025, drawing nearly seven million people in cities such as New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles. Protesters used slogans like 'Democracy not Monarchy' to oppose President Donald Trump’s expansion of executive power, National Guard deployments, and perceived authoritarian tactics. Despite accusations from Trump allies that the rallies were 'Antifa-linked', the events were largely peaceful, with no arrests reported in major cities. Key figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy emphasized that the protests were about defending American democracy, not hatred of the nation. In response to the demonstrations, Republican governors in several states activated National Guard units, though no violence occurred. The protests also extended internationally to Europe, with solidarity demonstrations in Berlin, Madrid, Rome, London, and Toronto, reflecting global concern over democratic backsliding and authoritarianism under the Trump administration.",
