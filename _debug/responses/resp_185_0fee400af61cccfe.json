  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A historic Clydebuilt sailing ship, the Falls of Clyde, built in 1878 and moored in Honolulu since the 1960s, was towed out to sea and deliberately sunk by the Honolulu Harbour Board in October 2025. The ship, which had suffered damage from a 1980s hurricane and years of neglect, was the subject of a decade-long campaign led by Scottish activist David O'Neill to bring it back to Scotland for restoration. Despite offers of free transport from a Norwegian and an American firm, negotiations collapsed, and the ship was scuttled 25 miles south of Honolulu, sparking outrage from maritime conservation groups in both the UK and USA. The Hawaii Department of Transportation confirmed the operation, preserving the ship’s name, wheel, and bell for display. The event is seen as a symbol of failed heritage preservation, with critics calling it a day of infamy. David O'Neill has since shifted focus to a different Clydebuilt vessel, the HMS Ambuscade, a 1970s frigate formerly in Pakistan’s navy, which he is now working to return to Scotland.",
