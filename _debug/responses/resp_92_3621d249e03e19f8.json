  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists the struggle against Hamas is far from over, despite a ceasefire agreement that saw the release of 20 living hostages and only nine of 28 deceased hostages. A dispute persists over the locations of at least six missing bodies, with Israel accusing Hamas of hiding them and claiming access to the remains. The United States, Turkey, and international bodies like the UN are involved in mediating recovery efforts and ensuring humanitarian aid continues without being used as leverage. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum demands full compliance, and Israel has backed down from threats to restrict aid. Meanwhile, key ceasefire conditions — including Hamas disarming and Israeli withdrawal — remain unmet, and Netanyahu continues to pledge to recover all hostages, emphasizing that victory and peace are still within reach.",
