    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its cold climate, has confirmed the presence of the Culiseta annulata mosquito species for the first time in the wild.",
    "The mosquitoes were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected a fly suspected to be a mosquito.",
    "Entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed the species and identified it as Culiseta annulata, a species native to the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to cold climates.",
    "This is the first recorded instance of mosquitoes thriving in the natural environment in Iceland, unlike a previous isolated case from an airplane.",
    "Theories for the mosquito's arrival include shipping or container transport, with ongoing monitoring needed to determine if the species can survive the winter and establish itself.",
    "Culiseta annulata is well-adapted to cold conditions, allowing adults to survive in sheltered areas during freezing winters.",
    "Climate change may be contributing to warmer temperatures, increasing the potential for mosquito species to establish in Iceland, but experts are cautious about directly linking the discovery to climate change.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson suggest that mosquito presence in cold regions has occurred before, and that while warming may increase the likelihood, it is not yet proven as a direct cause.",
    "As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes are expanding their range, making them one of the 'real winners' of climate change."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long known for its cold climate and mosquito-free status, has experienced the first confirmed discovery of wild mosquitoes in the country—specifically the Culiseta annulata species—found in Kiðafell, near Reykjavík. The discovery was made by resident Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected a suspicious fly, leading entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson to confirm the species. While the origin of the mosquito remains uncertain, theories suggest it arrived via shipping or containers. The species is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winters in sheltered areas. Experts are divided on whether climate change directly caused this event, noting that mosquitoes have been found in cold regions before, and that warming may only increase the potential for future establishment. As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes are expanding into previously inhospitable areas, making this discovery a key example of climate change’s ecological impact.",
