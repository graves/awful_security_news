  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims in October 2025 about a link between autism and circumcision, citing two studies and a 2025 preprint from WPLab. Experts clarify that both studies only show weak correlations, not causation, and neither examined acetaminophen use. The 2013 study, which looked at nine countries, found no evidence linking acetaminophen to autism and cautioned against interpreting correlation as causation. The 2015 Danish study reported a modest increase in autism risk among circumcised boys but with extremely small sample sizes and methodological limitations. The 2025 WPLab preprint, which is not peer-reviewed, misrepresents the evidence and promotes a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. Decades of research confirm that acetaminophen is safe for infants when used appropriately. Kennedy’s claims, supported by a company with ties to him, are not supported by scientific consensus and have been criticized by leading autism researchers.",
