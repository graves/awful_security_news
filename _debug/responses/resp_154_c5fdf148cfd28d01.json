The thieves, believed to be four professionals, entered through a window on the Seine-facing facade, likely aided by ongoing construction, and fled on motorcycles. The crown was later recovered outside the museum. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, and Culture Minister Rachida Dati, condemned the incident as a serious attack on national cultural heritage. Experts like Anthony Amore stress the deep cultural and historical value of the stolen items, which are not just financially valuable but symbolize centuries of royal history.

Authorities are conducting a full investigation, including reviewing CCTV and interviewing staff, as the perpetrators remain at large.",
