  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence at La Santé Prison in Paris, making him the first modern French head of state to serve time in prison. The sentence follows a conviction for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. Sarkozy has appealed the conviction and maintains he is innocent, criticizing the judicial process as politically driven and harmful to national dignity. He is housed in the prison's VIP wing, historically reserved for high-risk or politically sensitive individuals, including former dictators, terrorists, and notorious criminals like Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine. His legal team has requested early release, with a two-month window for the court to decide. The case raises broader questions about political accountability, campaign finance ethics, and the role of justice in democratic societies.",
