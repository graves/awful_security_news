  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith have denied claims that investigators in the January 6 probe wiretapped Republican members of Congress. The toll records, which only include call time, duration, and numbers, were obtained through court orders in 2023 and cover a narrow four-day window from January 4 to January 7, 2021, with a focus on whether President Trump or his surrogates attempted to contact lawmakers to delay the certification of the 2020 election results. Smith’s legal team asserts that the data collection was lawful, narrowly tailored, and consistent with standard investigative procedures, noting similar practices in investigations involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez. Republican senators have accused the FBI and Smith of political weaponization, particularly in light of the timing and scope of the records disclosure, which occurred during a Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Democrats raised concerns about political motives in recent indictments, including those of former FBI Director James Comey, further highlighting tensions over the perceived politicization of the investigation.",
