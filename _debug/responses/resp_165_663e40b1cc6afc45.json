  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF)—a proposed global carbon-pricing system for shipping—by at least 12 months due to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused the IMO of enforcing a 'Global Green New Scam Tax' on shipping and vowed to impose sanctions on supporting countries. Despite earlier approval of the framework in April, the decision to postpone it, which passed by 57 to 49 votes, was driven by political pressure. The NZF would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne penalty for excess CO2 emissions, aiming to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. While major economies like China, the EU, and Britain backed the initiative, countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted or voted against it. Industry leaders and climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s climate minister and the International Chamber of Shipping, criticized the delay as undermining urgent climate action, especially as climate change already impacts shipping through extreme weather and shifting ocean currents.",
