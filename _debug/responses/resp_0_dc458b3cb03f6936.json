  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Queens, New York, represents a rare success story in U.S. manufacturing by relying on skilled craftsmanship and premium quality rather than mass production. Despite President Donald Trump’s trade policies, including tariffs on steel, aluminum, and copper, Steinway has remained profitable due to high pricing, domestic sourcing, and a consistent, skilled workforce. The company’s production process — taking up to 11 months and producing only four to five pianos per day — highlights the value of human expertise in an era of automation. Challenges such as the scarcity of Sitka spruce from Alaska and the difficulty of recruiting skilled workers underscore the fragility of such artisanal models. The article also critiques Trump’s trade agenda, noting that economic uncertainty and tariffs have created more harm than benefit, with U.S. manufacturing losing over 42,000 jobs since April 2025. Steinway’s enduring presence in New York City serves as a symbol of what is possible when manufacturing values quality, tradition, and human skill over scale and cost-cutting.",
