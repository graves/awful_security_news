  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several major institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the agreement. The Compact proposes politically aligned policies such as banning transgender students from using restrooms or playing sports in accordance with gender identity, freezing tuition for five years, limiting international enrollment, and requiring standardized tests for admissions. These institutions argue that the Compact undermines academic integrity, scientific merit, and fair research funding, particularly in light of prior federal grant cancellations over DEI and transgender policies. The White House held a virtual meeting with several schools to discuss the proposal, but rejections from UVA and Dartmouth indicate that the initiative faces strong opposition across both public and private universities, signaling a broader crisis of trust between federal policy and academic autonomy.",
