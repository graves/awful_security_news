  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 19, 2025, the United States released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries—Ecuador and Colombia—after the Trump administration determined that the survivors were 'narco-terrorists' and that the US had no legal authority to detain them long-term. The strike, the sixth in the Caribbean since September 2025, targeted a vessel allegedly carrying narcotics, with two people killed and two survivors taken into custody. One survivor, Jeison Obando Perez from Colombia, arrived with severe injuries and was medically treated; the other was received by Ecuador, where authorities are assessing health and initiating legal proceedings. The US claims executive authority under Article II to conduct such operations, but this raises constitutional and international legal questions, especially given that Congress has not authorized armed conflict against drug traffickers. Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro accused the US of violating sovereignty and killing a civilian fisherman during a prior strike on September 15, claiming the boat was adrift and not involved in drug trafficking. The article highlights a growing tension between military action and international law, as well as the diplomatic fallout from US operations in the region.",
