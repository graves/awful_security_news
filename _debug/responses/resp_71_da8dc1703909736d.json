  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on October 20, 2025, disrupting key online services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking for several hours. The outage stemmed from a failure in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented websites from accessing data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services. Although AWS is generally reliable, the incident highlights the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure due to overreliance on a single cloud provider. Experts note that this reflects a broader systemic issue — the internet was designed to be decentralized and resilient, yet today’s digital economy is highly concentrated in a few cloud platforms. Historical outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and AT&T’s network failures, demonstrate that such disruptions are not isolated events but signs of deeper vulnerabilities in global digital systems. Experts emphasize the need for redundancy, competitive cloud services, and decentralized architecture to reduce risk and prevent cascading failures.",
