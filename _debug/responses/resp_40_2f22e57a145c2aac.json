  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which was initially celebrated as a diplomatic triumph, American public opinion remains largely unimpressed and skeptical. Trump’s approval ratings on both the Gaza deal and broader economic policy have declined, with the economy — especially inflation and cost of living — becoming the dominant concern. Polling data from AP-NORC and CNBC reveal that Americans disapprove of Trump’s leadership on economic issues at record levels, and that public pessimism about the economy and job security is rising. The article argues that foreign policy achievements, even major ones, are overshadowed by domestic economic anxieties, with many Americans prioritizing economic stability over international diplomacy. This reflects a broader trend where public trust in Trump is rooted more in economic performance than in foreign policy outcomes.",
