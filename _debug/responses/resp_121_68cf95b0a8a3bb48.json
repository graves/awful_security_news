  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, on October 20, 2025, with vibrant displays of lamps, prayers, and fireworks. The celebration reached its peak in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, where over 2.6 million earthen lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River — a symbolic return of Lord Ram — retaining a Guinness World Record. The event involved more than 33,000 volunteers and consumed significant resources, including 73,000 liters of oil and 5.5 million cotton wicks. However, the festivities were accompanied by serious environmental concerns, as air pollution levels surged to 347 on the AQI — 14 times WHO’s recommended limit — due to firecrackers. In response, India’s top court lifted a blanket ban, permitting limited use of eco-friendly 'green firecrackers' that reduce emissions by 30%. The event underscores the tension between deep-rooted cultural traditions and urgent environmental sustainability needs in modern India.",
