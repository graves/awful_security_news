  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A California judge has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murder of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The brothers, who previously served life without parole, took full responsibility for the killings and testified about their remorse, childhood abuse, and extensive rehabilitation efforts in prison, including founding programs for inmates. Family members and prison staff testified to their transformation and positive impact. Despite claims of fabricated abuse and a moderate risk of recidivism, the judge acknowledged their rehabilitation and said they 'should get that chance' for parole. However, final approval rests with the state parole board, which must recommend release, and Governor Gavin Newsom, who has the authority to deny or grant parole and could commute the sentence immediately. The brothers are also pursuing a new trial via a habeas petition, citing new evidence including a 1988 letter from Erik about abuse. This ruling marks a significant shift in the legal and public perception of justice and rehabilitation in high-profile cases.",
