  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president-elect in over two decades, won 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election, signaling a decisive break from decades of leftist rule under the MAS party. His campaign, bolstered by former police captain Edman Lara, emphasized anti-corruption, economic realism, and a new alliance with the United States — particularly the Trump administration — to rebuild diplomatic ties and attract foreign investment. Paz rejected an IMF bailout, citing national sovereignty, and instead plans to stabilize the economy through targeted fuel subsidies and direct cash transfers to the poor. The new government faces immediate challenges, including restoring faith in institutions, reforming a politically biased judiciary, and managing protests from both former MAS supporters and those disillusioned by past electoral frauds. In a symbolic shift, Paz engaged in a video call with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, signaling a break from Venezuela’s Maduro regime and a new alignment with democratic forces in Latin America. The article underscores a broader regional shift toward conservative, market-oriented governance in South America.",
