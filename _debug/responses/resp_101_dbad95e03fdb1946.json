  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel launched retaliatory strikes in Gaza targeting Hamas infrastructure in response to attacks on Israeli troops in the Rafah area, accusing Hamas of breaching a fragile ceasefire. Hamas denied any involvement, accusing Israel of fabricating attacks and violating the agreement, while also reporting it was cut off from operations in Rafah. The U.S. State Department reported credible intelligence of Hamas planning attacks on civilians, and the ceasefire, brokered by the U.S. and tied to hostage releases, remains under severe strain. The conflict escalated with two Israeli soldiers killed and a family of 11 reportedly killed in a bus attack, while Gaza's Health Ministry reports over 68,000 Palestinian deaths since 2023. International observers, including Al Jazeera and the Associated Press, have highlighted repeated ceasefire violations, raising global concern over the sustainability of the truce and humanitarian consequences.",
