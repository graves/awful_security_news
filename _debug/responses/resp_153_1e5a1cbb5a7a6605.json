  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a fragile US-brokered ceasefire beginning on October 10, 2025, Israel has continued air strikes and shootings in Gaza, including attacks in al-Shaaf and Shujayea, claiming retaliation for Hamas violations such as alleged attacks in Rafah. The ceasefire’s key boundary—the yellow line, drawn by US President Donald Trump on October 4—has caused confusion among civilians due to the lack of visible markers. At least 97 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began, with over 40 killed in one Israeli strike. Hamas denies involvement in the Rafah incident and accuses Israel of creating false pretexts. Humanitarian aid has been obstructed by Israeli military checkpoints, and UNRWA shelters, including one in Nuseirat, have been targeted. US envoys, including Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, JD Vance, and Usha Vance, have traveled to Israel to reinforce the ceasefire, with diplomatic efforts focused on disarming Hamas, Israeli troop withdrawal, and establishing an international 'board of peace.' Hamas and allied factions reject foreign governance and have resisted disarmament, complicating implementation. The situation underscores ongoing violations of international humanitarian law and deepening tensions in one of the world’s most volatile conflict zones.",
