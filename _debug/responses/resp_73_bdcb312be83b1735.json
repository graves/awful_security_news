    "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, is charged with 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing it with family members without proper clearances.",
    "The charges include allegations that a cyber actor linked to Iran hacked Bolton’s email account after he left the White House, potentially exposing sensitive national defense information.",
    "Unlike the cases of James Comey and Letitia James, where Trump directly pressured prosecutors or removed them, Bolton’s case was brought by experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors—Kelly O. Hayes and Tom Sullivan—without Trump directly forcing a loyalist to bring the charges.",
    "A federal judge in 2020 had previously warned that Bolton had likely violated national security protocols by mishandling classified information, indicating prior judicial concern.",
    "The stakes are higher than in the Comey or James cases—Bolton’s alleged actions could have exposed classified information to foreign adversaries, making the case more serious than false statements or mortgage fraud.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article examines the recent indictment of John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including allegations that a cyber actor linked to Iran accessed his personal email and exposed sensitive national defense data. While Trump has publicly accused Bolton of crimes and targeted him for retribution—stripping him of his security clearance and canceling his security detail—the case differs from those of James Comey and Letitia James in that Trump did not directly pressure prosecutors or force a loyalist to bring the charges. Instead, experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors led the case, and a prior federal judge had already expressed concern about Bolton’s mishandling of classified information. The stakes are considered higher due to potential foreign exposure of classified data. The article underscores the broader political controversy over whether the justice system is being weaponized against political adversaries, especially given that the investigation began under the Biden administration and includes detailed investigative findings.",
