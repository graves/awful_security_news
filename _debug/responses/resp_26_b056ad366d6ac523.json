  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the second week of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed on October 7, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza. Despite Hamas claiming to have handed over all accessible remains, Israel suspects it holds knowledge of missing bodies and accuses Hamas of using them as leverage. The ceasefire is under strain due to delayed body recoveries, Israeli military killings of civilians, and a lack of humanitarian access—particularly through the closed Rafah border crossing. Aid groups and the World Food Programme report severe delivery challenges. Meanwhile, Phase Two negotiations in Egypt focus on demilitarization, Palestinian governance, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) under a U.S.-led plan involving a technocratic administration and a Board of Peace chaired by Donald Trump. However, Hamas remains vague on disarmament, and international participation in the ISF is still being negotiated, with some countries demanding a UN mandate.",
