The pressure comes as Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, seeks to consolidate Republican support to oppose Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, by dismissing Sliwa as a weak alternative. Sliwa has responded by rejecting this narrative, emphasizing that he represents blue-collar, working-class voters and criticizing Cuomo and billionaire donors for shaping the election. The article highlights growing tension between grassroots, community-based candidates and establishment figures, with both Sliwa and Mamdani asserting that voters, not donors, should determine the city’s future. President Donald Trump has also dismissed Sliwa, mocking his cat-related image and political style, further underscoring the skepticism surrounding his candidacy.",
