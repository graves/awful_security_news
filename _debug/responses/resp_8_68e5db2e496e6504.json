Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield criticized the ruling as unconstitutional and a violation of state sovereignty and First Amendment rights.

Similar legal challenges are unfolding in Illinois (Chicago) and Tennessee (Memphis), where officials argue no emergency exists and that troop deployments violate constitutional and state laws. In San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie and Governor Gavin Newsom rejected troop deployment, stating it would not improve safety or public values. A bipartisan group of senators has also called for a federal inquiry into the broader impact of domestic military deployments on military readiness and resources.",
