  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison in 2025 for a 2013 sexual assault at Gettysburg College. The assault occurred during winter break when Keeler, an 18-year-old student, was left vulnerable. For over a decade, the case remained unprosecuted due to systemic failures, including lost evidence and prosecutorial reluctance. In 2019, Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you,' prompting Keeler to renew her efforts. After years of legal and logistical challenges, Cleary was extradited from France in 2024, where he had been detained on a vagrancy charge. He pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault, and the judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, considered his remorse and mental health history in issuing a sentence below state guidelines. Shannon Keeler, the victim, described the emotional and long-term impact of the assault and the failure of the system to protect her. The case underscores broader issues of accountability, survivor advocacy, and reform in how campus sexual assaults are investigated and prosecuted.",
