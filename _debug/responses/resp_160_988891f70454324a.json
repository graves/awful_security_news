  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A surge in AI-powered deepfake voice scams has emerged, with a notable case targeting Italian businessmen who received calls from a fake Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, asking for over 1 million euros to free kidnapped journalists. The scam, which occurred in February 2025, exploited AI voice cloning technology that can mimic real human speech with high realism, making it indistinguishable from actual voices. Research by Queen Mary University of London found that AI voice clones are rated as equally trustworthy as real voices, and participants were more likely to believe AI voices than real ones. Global losses from such scams have increased dramatically, with over $547 million lost between January and June 2025. The technology also enables the creation of fake news, illicit sexual content, and deepfakes of real people. In response, the US and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize the publication of AI-generated intimate images, highlighting growing global concern over AI’s misuse in fraud and abuse.",
