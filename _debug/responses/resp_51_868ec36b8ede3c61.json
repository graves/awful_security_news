    "Iceland, long considered mosquito-free due to its extreme cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquitoes of the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The discovery was made in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who noticed and collected a strange fly at dusk on October 16, 2025.",
    "The mosquitoes were identified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, who confirmed the species as Culiseta annulata.",
    "Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere, from North Africa to northern Siberia, and is adapted to cold climates through sheltered winter survival.",
    "This is the first confirmed record of mosquitoes in Iceland’s natural environment; a prior single mosquito was found in a plane at Keflavík Airport years ago.",
    "Theories suggest the mosquito may have arrived via ships or containers, though the exact mechanism remains unknown.",
    "Further monitoring in spring is needed to determine if the species can survive the winter and establish a permanent population.",
    "Climate change may be contributing to the spread of mosquitoes globally, but it is uncertain whether it directly caused this discovery in Iceland.",
    "Experts note that mosquitoes have been found in northern Scandinavia, suggesting that Iceland may have been hospitable to them even without climate change.",
    "As global temperatures rise, mosquitoes are expanding their range and growing faster, potentially increasing disease risks worldwide."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, long considered free of wild mosquitoes due to its harsh winter climate, has confirmed the presence of the Culiseta annulata mosquito species for the first time in the natural environment. The discovery, made in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, was initiated by Björn Hjaltason, who observed and collected a strange fly at dusk on October 16, 2025. The finding was verified by entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson, who identified the species as Culiseta annulata, native to cold regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. While a single mosquito was previously found at Keflavík Airport years ago, this is the first confirmed case of wild mosquitoes in Iceland. Scientists are uncertain whether climate change directly caused this event, though warming temperatures may increase the likelihood of future mosquito establishment. Experts note that mosquitoes have already been found in northern Scandinavia, suggesting Iceland may have been ecologically suitable for such species even without significant climate change. Ongoing monitoring in spring will determine if the species can survive winter and become established, marking a potential shift in Iceland’s ecological balance as global warming progresses.",
