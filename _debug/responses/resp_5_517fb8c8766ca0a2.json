  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's power, water, and heating infrastructure—particularly in Chernihiv and Sumy—causing mass blackouts, civilian casualties, and prolonged humanitarian crises. Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of deliberately prolonging suffering by circling damaged facilities with drones. In response, Ukraine has launched retaliatory strikes, including on Russia’s Bryansk Chemical Plant, and is seeking expanded military support from European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging the European Union to use frozen Russian assets—amounting to $200 billion—as a financial resource to fund air defense systems like the Patriot and long-range missiles. This shift reflects Ukraine’s dual strategy of defensive resilience and offensive retaliation, while also highlighting geopolitical tensions, including concerns over a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest hosted by Viktor Orban, and the cyclical nature of Russian attacks tied to shifts in Western political tone.",
