  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement allowing asylum seekers to be transferred to Belize, a move aligned with the Trump administration’s broader policy of limiting asylum applications and increasing deportations. Belize asserts it has robust safeguards, including national security vetoes, transfer caps, and human rights protections, and claims the deal respects international law. However, the agreement faces criticism from human rights experts and Belizean opposition leaders who argue it could expose asylum seekers to abuse, lack of due process, or inadequate care in countries like Eswatini, South Sudan, or El Salvador. Critics also point out that some deportees have been returned to their home countries, undermining the necessity of third-country transfers. The deal still requires Senate approval in Belize and remains controversial due to concerns over compliance with international refugee law and the capacity of Belize’s underfunded systems to handle asylum seekers.",
