  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests erupted in Gabes, Tunisia, over severe environmental pollution caused by the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which residents blame for respiratory illness, cancer, and ecological collapse. The UGTT labour union led the demonstrations, demanding the plant’s immediate shutdown, citing years of neglect and broken promises from the government, including a 2017 pledge to phase it out. Despite this, authorities have increased production, calling phosphate vital to the national economy. Over 200 people have been hospitalized due to gas exposure, and activists report that even local agriculture is affected. President Kais Saied has labeled the crisis an 'environmental assassination,' while protesters continue to demand accountability, with the UGTT threatening further large-scale protests. Chinese companies have been brought in to manage emissions, but public outrage remains high, marking one of the most significant challenges to Saied’s rule since 2021.",
