  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have reached an immediate ceasefire after a week of deadly cross-border clashes along their 2,600km border, following peace talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The agreement, confirmed by both countries' officials, includes a commitment to stop cross-border attacks, respect sovereignty, and establish follow-up meetings in Istanbul on October 25 to ensure the ceasefire's sustainability. Pakistan accused Afghanistan of allowing militant groups like the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil, while the Taliban affirmed its opposition to any attacks on Pakistan or its citizens. Despite shared regional history, deteriorating relations have been driven by the TTP’s resurgence, which has conducted over 600 attacks in Pakistan and claimed a 46% increase in violence in 2025. Analysts argue that military action against Afghanistan is counterproductive, citing past failures. The ceasefire marks a fragile but significant step toward peace, pending verifiable mechanisms and mutual trust.",
