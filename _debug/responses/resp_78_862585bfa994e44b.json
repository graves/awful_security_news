  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, expanded her temporary restraining order against the Trump administration’s use of aggressive tactics by immigration and border enforcement agents in Chicago. The original order prohibited the use of tear gas, pepper balls, and other less-lethal weapons on individuals not posing an immediate threat, and restricted targeting of journalists. Following reports of violent encounters—such as tear gas deployment and pepper ball shots at a pastor during a demonstration—Ellis demanded accountability, requiring all agents in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during protests to document actions. While the Department of Justice argues that implementing and reviewing body camera footage is logistically unfeasible, Ellis insists on transparency, especially in urban settings where crowd control differs from border zones. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker supports the order, calling media reports misleading. Additionally, a federal appellate court denied the Trump administration’s request to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois, citing unreliability in DHS assessments and lack of evidence of rebellion. Tensions also exist between immigration and FBI agents over body camera use, with some immigration agents refusing joint operations to avoid being recorded.",
