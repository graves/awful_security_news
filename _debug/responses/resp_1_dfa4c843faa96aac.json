  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China’s leadership, under President Xi Jinping, is convening the fourth plenum to finalize its next five-year economic strategy (2026–2030), amid intensifying geopolitical friction with the United States and internal economic challenges such as slowing growth, overcapacity, and deflation. The meeting, held in Beijing, is a pivotal moment for showcasing China’s centralized economic planning and political control, especially as it coincides with a potential high-level diplomatic meeting between Xi and US President Donald Trump. Key elements include a sweeping anti-corruption purge of the Central Military Commission, notably the removal of General He Weidong and Miao Hua, signaling Xi’s tightening grip over military and party leadership. The new five-year plan is expected to prioritize technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, new energy, and biotechnology, while addressing domestic issues like overproduction and weak consumer demand. Despite economic headwinds—such as a Q3 2025 growth rate of just 4.8%—external analysts predict continuity in policy, with only targeted adjustments like curbing domestic competition and boosting consumption. The plenum is also seen as a major personnel reshuffle, potentially marking the largest shake-up since 2017, reinforcing Xi’s enduring dominance within the Communist Party structure.",
