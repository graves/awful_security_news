    "The Supreme Court agreed to review whether the federal law banning certain drug users from possessing firearms violates the Second Amendment.",
    "The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the United States and Pakistan, who was charged after the FBI found a 9mm pistol, 60 grams of marijuana, and 4.7 grams of cocaine at his home.",
    "The Trump administration defended the law, arguing that habitual drug users pose a danger to society, especially during impaired encounters with police.",
    "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a law cannot target habitual drug users, citing a historical precedent that only applies to those under the influence at the time of arrest.",
    "The government appealed this decision, claiming evidence from a 2019 border search showed Hemani was planning fraud linked to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps affiliates, and that he traveled to Iran to celebrate the death of Qasem Soleimani in 2020.",
    "Hemani’s legal team challenged the historical basis of the law, noting that nearly half of U.S. states have legalized recreational marijuana, suggesting a significant overlap between legal cannabis users and firearm possession.",
    "The case is significant because it builds on prior Supreme Court decisions, such as the 2022 ruling allowing easier public handgun carry, and raises questions about the narrowness and historical justification of gun prohibitions.",
    "President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was previously convicted under the same law and later pardoned by President Biden."
