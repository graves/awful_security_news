  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israel and Hamas have exchanged the remains of 15 Israeli captives and 15 deceased Palestinians under a ceasefire agreement, with bodies of two Israeli captives—Aryeh Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar—returned to Israel. The exchange occurs amid ongoing criticism from Hamas, which claims Israel is violating ceasefire terms by refusing to reopen the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The crossing, which has remained closed since May 2024, is vital for humanitarian aid and medical access, and its closure has drawn international legal and diplomatic pressure, including from the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. Human rights advocates, including Ubai Al-Aboudi of the Bisan Center, argue that Palestinian detainees are being held without due process, calling them 'hostages' and highlighting widespread abuse. Despite the ceasefire, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza persists, with limited access to aid and ongoing displacement, underscoring the fragility of peace efforts and the deep-rooted conflict over self-determination and human rights.",
