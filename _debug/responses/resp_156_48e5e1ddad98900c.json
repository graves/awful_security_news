  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of a global emissions framework for shipping—the Net Zero Framework (NZF)—by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump publicly threatened sanctions on countries supporting the measure. The NZF, which would have introduced a carbon pricing system charging ships $380 per metric tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions, was initially approved in April 2025. Despite support from major economies such as China, the European Union, Brazil, and the UK, countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted their stance or voted for delay, citing political and economic concerns. The decision undermines climate goals, disrupts investment planning in the maritime sector, and reflects the growing tension between environmental regulation and fossil fuel interests, particularly under U.S. political influence. Experts and industry leaders warn that without clear regulatory pathways, the shipping industry will struggle to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.",
