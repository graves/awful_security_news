  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats across states such as Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and California are re-engaging abortion rights as a central campaign issue, despite economic concerns dominating voter priorities. Virginia’s governor race has become a focal point, with Democratic candidates like Abigail Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi emphasizing reproductive rights, using personal narratives and targeted advertising to contrast with Republican opponents like Winsome Earle-Sears and Jason Miyares. Virginia remains the only Southern state without abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade was overturned, making it a key battleground. While polls show abortion is not the top concern for voters, trust in Democratic candidates on reproductive rights is higher, and Democrats aim to pass a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion access. Republicans are attempting to downplay the issue, with some candidates making vague statements or linking abortion to broader policy issues. Federal actions, including cuts to Planned Parenthood funding and safety studies on mifepristone, have increased political stakes. Advocates argue that the 2024 political lesson of abortion being sidelined must not repeat, and that abortion remains a critical differentiator in party politics.",
