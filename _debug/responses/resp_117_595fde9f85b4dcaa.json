    "New Jersey is experiencing a close gubernatorial race between Democratic congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite being a traditionally blue state in federal elections.",
    "The race is increasingly personal, with both candidates launching attacks: Ciattarelli accusing Sherrill of being barred from walking at her naval academy graduation due to a cheating scandal, and Sherrill accusing Ciattarelli’s former medical publishing company of downplaying opioid dangers and claiming he is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.",
    "Sherrill has received endorsements from high-profile figures such as former President Barack Obama, while Ciattarelli has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, who also plans to host tele-rallies for him.",
    "Political experts note that although Democrats have a 3-to-2 voter registration advantage in New Jersey, the state has a history of electing governors from both parties, and the race is considered 'decidedly purple' at the gubernatorial level.",
    "Affordability and cost of living are central concerns for voters, especially following a 17% to 20% surge in electricity bills in June 2025.",
    "Sherrill’s background as a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor contrasts with Ciattarelli’s background as an accountant and former state Assembly member, with supporters emphasizing different policy strengths.",
    "Ciattarelli’s campaign has threatened legal action against Sherrill for defamation over claims of mass opioid-related deaths, while Sherrill has accused Ciattarelli of being complicit in public health failures.",
    "If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party in three consecutive terms."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are locked in a closely contested, increasingly personal campaign. Despite New Jersey's historical blue streak in federal elections, the race is considered 'purple' at the gubernatorial level, with both candidates drawing strong national support—Sherrill backed by former President Barack Obama and Ciattarelli endorsed by Donald Trump. The race centers on affordability, with voters concerned about soaring energy costs after a 17%–20% rise in electricity bills. Personal attacks have intensified, including claims that Sherrill was barred from walking at her naval academy graduation and that Ciattarelli’s former company downplayed opioid risks, leading to defamation threats. Experts note that if Sherrill wins, it would mark the first time since the 1960s that the state has elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms. The outcome may hinge on which candidate better addresses economic and public health concerns.",
