    "A mysterious glow detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at the center of the Milky Way has sparked debate between two explanations: pulsars (remnants of exploded stars) and dark matter collisions.",
    "Dark matter, which makes up about five times more of the universe than regular matter, has long been theorized to exist, first by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s and confirmed by Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford in the 1970s through observations of galaxy rotation speeds.",
    "Recent supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk of Johns Hopkins University show that dark matter could be distributed in an egg-shaped (non-spherical) structure at the galactic center, closely matching the observed shape of the gamma-ray glow.",
    "This non-spherical shape challenges previous models that assumed dark matter was uniformly spherical, and now provides a stronger case for dark matter — particularly WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) — as the source of the glow.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin operations in 2027, will provide high-resolution gamma-ray data capable of definitively distinguishing between dark matter and pulsar origins.",
    "While the new simulations don’t provide direct proof, they significantly bolster the possibility that dark matter, especially WIMPs, could be responsible for the glow and keep the WIMP hypothesis alive as a viable solution to the century-old dark matter mystery."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, first detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, has long been attributed to either pulsars or dark matter. While earlier models assumed dark matter was spherical, new simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues show that dark matter could be distributed in a squashed, egg-shaped form at the galactic center — closely matching the observed glow's shape. This strengthens the dark matter theory, especially the WIMP hypothesis, which posits that colliding dark matter particles produce gamma rays. Despite no direct detection, the study suggests a 50% chance the glow is due to dark matter rather than old stars. With the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) set to begin operations in 2027, scientists will have high-resolution data to definitively confirm or rule out the dark matter explanation, making this a pivotal moment in the century-long search to identify dark matter.",
