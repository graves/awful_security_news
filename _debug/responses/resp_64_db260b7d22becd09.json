  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military conducted a strike in the Caribbean targeting an alleged drug boat, resulting in the detention of two survivors — the first such instance under the Trump administration. This marks a shift from previous operations that resulted in total casualties, raising serious legal questions about the authority to detain individuals without due process, especially in the absence of congressional war declarations. The operation is tied to broader efforts to pressure Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, potentially over resource access or political concessions. The administration has justified the actions by classifying cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and relying on classified legal opinions, while legal experts warn that such actions may violate constitutional principles and could be challenged in court through habeas corpus petitions.",
