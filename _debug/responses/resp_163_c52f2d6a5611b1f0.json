  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing number of scams involving AI-generated voices have targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, including prominent figures like Giorgio Armani and Patrizio Bertelli, by faking the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request large financial transfers. The scam, which occurred in early February 2025, is part of a global rise in deepfake fraud, with global losses exceeding $547 million between January and June 2025. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that AI-generated voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices and are even rated as more trustworthy by participants. This technological advancement raises serious concerns about identity theft, fraud, and the creation of malicious deepfakes—especially those involving intimate or sexual content, such as AI-generated child sexual abuse material. In response, governments like the United States and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize the publication of AI-generated intimate images. While AI voice technology has promising applications, such as restoring speech for people who can no longer speak, its misuse poses significant risks to public safety, trust, and privacy.",
