Giuffre details three encounters with the prince, with Maxwell instructing her to 'do for him what you do for Jeffrey,' and Epstein paying her $15,000. Although Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations, including in a 2019 BBC interview, new evidence such as a 2011 email showing he remained in contact with Epstein and a police investigation into a request to check Giuffre’s criminal record further undermine his claims. The 2022 out-of-court settlement between Andrew and Giuffre, while non-admission of guilt, acknowledged her suffering. The UK government and Buckingham Palace are now under intense pressure to strip Andrew of his titles and remove him from royal residences. The memoir, which reached No. 1 on Amazon’s bestseller list, has drawn global attention to the broader issues of sexual exploitation, power abuse, and accountability within elite institutions.",
