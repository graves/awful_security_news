  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Coca-Cola has begun rolling out a soda made with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in select U.S. cities, following a demand from former President Donald Trump. This shift responds to political pressure and public health concerns, particularly from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have criticized high-fructose corn syrup. While the soda itself remains high in sugar and not healthier, the move aligns with Coca-Cola’s broader strategy of launching healthier alternatives, such as the successful relaunch of BodyArmor and growth in sales of its sugar-free Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The change reflects a growing consumer and political interest in healthier beverage choices, even as health experts continue to warn that sugar-filled sodas are not a health solution.",
