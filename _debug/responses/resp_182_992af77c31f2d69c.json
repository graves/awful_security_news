Sarkozy is currently in solitary confinement at La Santé prison, where he will have limited contact and is denied full social interaction. He has appealed the conviction, claiming innocence and asserting that the punishment reflects political revenge rather than justice. The case, known as the Bygmalion affair, has triggered national debate, with President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin offering public support, while Sarkozy maintains his belief in the truth and calls for a fair judicial outcome. A final appeal verdict is expected from France’s highest administrative court in late November 2025.",
