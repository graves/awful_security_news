  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against voters using artificial intelligence chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok—to decide how to vote, arguing that these models offer a highly distorted and polarized view of politics. Tests conducted in the lead-up to the October 29 parliamentary elections found that AI systems consistently recommended fringe parties like the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left, while centrist parties such as Democrats 66 and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy were recommended far less often. The watchdog emphasizes that AI tools lack transparency and verifiability, posing a risk to democratic integrity. The warning comes amid political uncertainty, as the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, has pulled from coalition talks over immigration policy, and is expected to win the most seats in the upcoming election but fall short of a majority. The authority urges both citizens and AI providers to avoid using AI as a voting guide to protect the fairness and authenticity of democratic decision-making.",
