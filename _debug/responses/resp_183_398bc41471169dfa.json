  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ecuador has released Andrés Fernando Tufiño, a survivor of a US military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling semi-submersible in the Caribbean. The US claims the vessel was a 'drug-carrying submarine' transporting fentanyl and other narcotics, targeting narco-terrorists linked to Venezuela's Cartel of the Suns. However, the Ecuadorean Attorney General's office stated there was no evidence of crime to justify detaining Tufiño, leading to his release. Colombian survivor Jeison Obando Pérez, who suffered a traumatic brain injury, is being treated in Bogotá. The strikes, conducted since September 2025, have killed at least 32 people, with over 10,000 US troops and military assets deployed. Critics, including Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, argue the operations breach international law and violate territorial waters, while the US insists it is combating transnational drug trafficking. The situation raises significant legal, humanitarian, and diplomatic concerns across the Caribbean region.",
