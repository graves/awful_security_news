  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two cases of clade I mpox have been confirmed in California — one in Long Beach and one in Los Angeles County — potentially marking the first instances of local transmission of this virus variant in the U.S. Health officials state that the risk to the public remains low and no evidence of community spread has been found. The cases are not linked to travel abroad, and close contacts have been vaccinated. While the virus is rare and similar to smallpox, its broader transmission pattern in Africa raises concern, especially given that the ongoing federal shutdown and CDC staff layoffs have reduced public health response capacity. Experts warn that the emergence of local transmission could signal a growing threat, particularly as the virus spreads through various forms of contact, not just sexual activity.",
