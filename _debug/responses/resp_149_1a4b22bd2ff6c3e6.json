  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning urging citizens not to use AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, or Grok to decide how to vote, as these models are found to provide highly distorted, biased, and polarized political advice. Tests conducted ahead of the October 29 parliamentary elections revealed that AI models frequently recommended fringe parties such as the Party for Freedom (PVV) and Green Left-Labour Party, while significantly under-representing centrist and moderate parties like the VVD and Democrats 66. The watchdog emphasizes that AI systems lack transparency and verifiability, posing a threat to democratic integrity by misaligning voter decisions with actual policy preferences. The warning comes amid political volatility, as the PVV, led by Geert Wilders, remains a strong contender due to its anti-immigration platform and strong public support, despite being excluded from coalition talks. This incident highlights growing concerns about the role of AI in shaping democratic processes and calls on chatbot providers to prevent their tools from being used as political voting guides.",
