  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre museum in Paris has been closed following a brazen heist in which armed robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery, stealing historic royal jewelry including a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise. The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, with the thieves leaving the building by scooters along the Seine. Experts, including French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin and French Senate member Natalie Goulet, have condemned the security failings at the museum, citing unsecured windows and poor oversight. Experts also believe the jewelry has likely been removed from France and sold on the black market, possibly melted down or recut to launder money, with no realistic chance of recovery. The incident is seen as a significant blow to French heritage and history, echoing past heists such as the 1911 Mona Lisa theft and the 1998 theft of a Camille Corot painting. Broader European museum thefts, including the 2025 heist at the Drents Museum in the Netherlands, highlight a growing threat to cultural artifacts.",
