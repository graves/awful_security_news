  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew’s ability to live in the 30-room Royal Lodge, a Grade II-listed property on the Windsor estate, is under intense public scrutiny due to allegations of ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and concerns over financial accountability. The lease agreement, signed in 2003, allowed him to pay a total of around £8 million in upfront lump sums for renovations and future rent, effectively eliminating annual payments. This arrangement, which includes strict conditions like no helicopters, no gambling, and mandatory upkeep, was initially seen as a financially prudent way to avoid taxpayer costs. However, recent revelations show that refurbishment costs exceeded £7.5 million and that the lease will last until 2078, with Prince Andrew's ex-wife and daughters entitled to continue living there. The Crown Estate and National Audit Office have confirmed the arrangement provides value for money, but political figures such as Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Robert Jenrick, and Lisa Smart have called for Prince Andrew to pay his fair share or live privately. The ongoing controversy and public demand for transparency have led to renewed scrutiny of the lease, with the NAO considering a re-examination to ensure taxpayer funds are not being misused.",
