  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is launching a legal defense against federal charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, arguing that the prosecution is the result of a personal vendetta by President Donald Trump and that the appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause. Comey’s attorneys claim that Trump retaliated against Comey for his public criticism, citing a pattern of personal attacks and retaliation, and assert that the Justice Department selectively targeted Comey while ignoring similar cases involving other officials. They also argue that Halligan’s appointment—after the 120-day interim limit—circumvented Senate confirmation requirements, drawing precedent from the dismissal of Trump’s own indictment over a similar appointment issue. These motions are part of a broader effort to have the case dismissed as an abuse of power and retaliation, highlighting concerns about political retaliation and executive overreach in the justice system.",
