  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On Tuesday, October 21, 2025, CVS reported a system outage affecting some of its U.S. pharmacies, preventing them from filling prescriptions or providing services like flu shots. A spokesperson confirmed it was due to a network connection issue, with most locations still operational but some patients experiencing delays. The outage occurred a day after a major AWS cloud outage that disrupted critical services globally, including hospital communications, banking apps, and smart home devices. This parallel event underscores the growing societal reliance on cloud-based systems and the fragility of essential services when digital infrastructure fails. The incident highlights public frustration, as seen on social media, and reflects broader concerns about digital resilience in daily life and healthcare access.",
