The shutdown has led to unpaid federal scientists, with only a few CDC scientists attending the event, and key research—such as findings on long-term outcomes of children with post-COVID inflammatory conditions—being withheld from presentation. This disruption comes amid broader policy shifts under the Trump administration, including funding cuts, layoffs, and restrictions on scientific collaboration, which experts say are dangerously counterproductive during public health emergencies. In response, researchers like Dr. Michael Osterholm are stepping in to maintain public health communication by launching open-access publications and forming collaborative research networks to fund and share critical disease data.",
