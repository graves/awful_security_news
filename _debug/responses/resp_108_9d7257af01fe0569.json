Claire Louise-Bennett’s *Big Kiss, Bye-Bye* emphasizes inner emotional life, Julia Ioffe’s *Motherland* offers a feminist history of modern Russia, and Jaquira Díaz’s *This Is the Only Kingdom* explores generational bonds in Puerto Rican communities. Finally, Philip Pullman concludes his *His Dark Materials* fantasy trilogy with *The Rose Field: The Book of Dust, Volume 3*.
