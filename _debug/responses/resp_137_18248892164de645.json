  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing unusual animal behavior, cloud formations, and using gunfire or signal fires to alert communities—is being relied upon to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), despite government investments in technological early warning systems. These systems have frequently failed due to technical issues, lack of community trust, and poor follow-up, as highlighted by reports and testimonies from shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain. With climate change accelerating glacier melt and reducing snow cover, the frequency of GLOFs has increased, leading to significant economic and human loss. While Pakistan’s government has awarded rewards to local heroes for their lifesaving actions, the broader issue remains one of institutional failure and misalignment with local realities. The article underscores a growing shift toward community-based, culturally embedded knowledge as a vital and under-recognized component of climate resilience in vulnerable regions.",
