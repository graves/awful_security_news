  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season, dramatic comebacks and record-breaking performances defined the outcomes. The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit against the New York Giants, becoming the first team to do so after leading by 18 points in the first three quarters. Second-year QB Bo Nix delivered a standout fourth-quarter performance, throwing two touchdowns and running for scores. In a separate game, the New England Patriots' Drake Maye broke Tom Brady's franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate, completing 21-of-23 passes and rushing for 62 yards. Meanwhile, quarterback struggles led to benchings: Tua Tagovailoa was replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers in Miami, and Justin Fields was benched by the Jets at halftime after a poor first half. The Jets remained winless at 0-7, while the Dolphins fell to 1-13. These events highlight the season's unpredictability, with late-game momentum, quarterback instability, and record-breaking individual performances shaping the narrative.",
