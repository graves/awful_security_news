  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun serving a five-year prison sentence after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy for accepting illegal funds from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign. He becomes the first former head of a European Union state to be imprisoned, marking a landmark moment in European political accountability. The conviction, upheld by presiding judge Nathalie Gavarino, who deemed the offences of 'exceptional gravity,' is seen as a rare and significant event in modern French history, especially given that no French leader has been imprisoned since WWII collaborationist Philippe Petain. Sarkozy, 70, will be held in solitary confinement in La Sante prison, with limited contact and access to the outside world. His lawyers have filed an appeal for release, which the court will consider within two months. The case has stirred public debate about political integrity, transparency, and the role of former leaders in democratic societies.",
