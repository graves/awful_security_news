The bodies are being processed at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for identification, marking the 14th and 15th confirmed deceased hostages to be returned. Hamas has faced difficulties in recovering all bodies due to war damage and previous misidentification of one body. The Israeli military and security agencies stress that the return of all bodies is essential for closure and humanitarian reasons, while the US Vice President JD Vance emphasized the difficulty and timeline challenges, noting that some bodies are buried under rubble. Tensions remain between Israel and Hamas over compliance with the ceasefire, with accusations of violations on both sides. This is a developing story tied to broader geopolitical and humanitarian concerns over peace, accountability, and the recovery of victims in a war-torn region.",
