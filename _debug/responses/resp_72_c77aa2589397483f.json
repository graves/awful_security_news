The move comes after President Donald Trump accused Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombian exports. The U.S. has reportedly attacked seven vessels suspected of drug smuggling, resulting in at least 30 deaths, with Colombia claiming some victims were Colombian citizens. This is the second such diplomatic recall in 2025, following a previous incident in July. Colombia blames U.S. actions for violating sovereignty and endangering its citizens, while the U.S. maintains its actions are justified under national security concerns.",
