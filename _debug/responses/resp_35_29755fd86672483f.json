  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for ending the war, citing the 'realities of where the conflict stands' and advocating for a ceasefire along current battle lines. This contradicts earlier statements where Trump claimed Ukraine might regain all lost territory. Trump reportedly raised his voice and dismissed Ukrainian requests for long-range missiles, expressing concern about escalating conflict and winter casualties. The meeting followed a prior phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a territorial swap involving Ukraine surrendering eastern Donbas for Russian-held parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. While Zelensky described the exchange as 'pointed,' he supported the ceasefire at current battle lines. The incident marks a significant shift in Trump’s peace strategy, emphasizing immediate cessation over territorial gains. Despite Ukrainian officials downplaying the meeting as negative, European sources noted tensions, with Trump insisting on a freeze in the front lines and rejecting demands for expanded support.",
