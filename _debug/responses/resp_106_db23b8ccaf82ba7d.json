  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former New York Republican representative expelled from Congress in 2023 over falsified personal and financial information, releasing him from federal prison in Fairton, New Jersey on October 18, 2025. Santos, who pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, became the first member of Congress ever expelled without a criminal conviction. Trump justified the commutation by drawing a comparison to Senator Richard Blumenthal’s past military service misstatement, arguing that Santos' actions were not as severe. This action aligns with Trump’s broader pattern of executive pardons, including those for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and over 1,500 individuals linked to the January 6 Capitol attack.",
