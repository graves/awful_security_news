OpenAI is expanding its AI reach through partnerships with e-commerce and travel platforms like Etsy, Shopify, Expedia, and Booking.com. Despite strong growth in ChatGPT’s user base—reaching 800 million weekly active users—analysts remain skeptical about Atlas's ability to displace mainstream browsers, noting that platforms like Edge already offer similar AI features.
