  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Guillermo del Toro’s 2025 film adaptation of Frankenstein reinterprets Mary Shelley’s classic novel with a deeply emotional and human-centered narrative, focusing on the Creature’s journey from a misunderstood being to a complex, empathetic individual. Portrayed by Jacob Elordi, the Creature evolves through observation and connection with a family, particularly a blind patriarch played by David Bradley, and develops emotional depth including regret, sorrow, and empathy. The film contrasts this with Victor Frankenstein, played by Oscar Isaac, who is depicted as arrogant, self-centered, and morally failing. Del Toro introduces new narrative elements—such as a young Frankenstein (Christian Convery), a capitalist patron (Christoph Waltz), and a romantic subplot involving Elizabeth (Mia Goth)—to deepen the moral conflict and humanize the monster. While the film diverges from the original novel in plot and character structure, it remains faithful to Shelley’s core themes of creation, responsibility, and rejection. The visual design is immersive and haunting, and the film's emotional tone aligns with del Toro’s signature style of elevating outcast characters to heroic status. Despite some narrative complications, the film is widely praised for its emotional resonance and moral clarity, reinforcing the idea that the true monster is not the Creature, but the creator's hubris.",
