  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, lasting several hours and disrupting critical online services such as banking, social media, airline booking, and e-commerce. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented access to data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB and EC2 services. Experts note that the internet’s increasing reliance on a small number of cloud providers—despite being originally designed to be resilient and decentralized—creates systemic fragility. This outage echoes earlier events, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, highlighting recurring vulnerabilities in global digital infrastructure. While AWS has not frequently experienced such disruptions, the scale of impact underscores a critical need for redundancy, better failover systems, and more competitive cloud alternatives to prevent cascading failures.",
