  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in Lima and the neighboring province of Callao to combat rising crime, following violent protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured. The emergency, approved by the Council of Ministers and set to begin just after midnight on October 21, 2025, allows for the deployment of armed forces alongside police to restore public order. This marks a shift from defense to offense in the fight against crime, with President Jeri emphasizing the need to regain public trust. The move follows his earlier campaign to prioritize crime control after the ousting of former President Dina Boluarte, who previously implemented a similar emergency in March 2025. Despite past emergency declarations, analysts note that such measures have not significantly reduced crime. The decision reflects widespread public concern, especially from youth-led protests under the banner of Generation Z, highlighting a growing political and social crisis in Peru.",
