  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have refuted claims that investigators in the January 6 Capitol riot probe wiretapped Republican members of Congress, asserting that toll records—limiting to call duration, time, and numbers—were collected through standard, lawful investigative procedures during a narrow four-day window (January 4–7, 2021) to assess whether Trump allies attempted to contact senators to delay certification of the 2020 election results. The records were obtained under court orders in 2023 and were disclosed in both Smith’s report and the 2024 indictment of Donald Trump. Smith’s legal team emphasizes that toll data collection is routine and not politically motivated, noting that similar data was used in investigations involving President Biden and Senator Bob Menendez. Republican lawmakers, including those on the Senate Judiciary Committee, have accused the FBI and Smith of political weaponization, particularly during a recent Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi, where concerns about targeting political opponents were raised. The dispute highlights the broader tension over whether the investigation into January 6 subversion is driven by legitimate inquiry or political retaliation.",
