  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. Senators Tim Kaine, Adam Schiff, and Rand Paul are pushing to force a Senate vote to prevent President Donald Trump from unilaterally declaring war on Venezuela, citing a surge in military strikes and covert CIA operations in the Caribbean and Venezuela. The resolution, filed by Kaine and co-sponsored by Schiff and Paul, is designed to uphold Congress's constitutional authority to declare war. Trump has authorized at least five military strikes since September, claiming to target drug smuggling, with 27 people reportedly killed—though identities remain unshared. A previous vote on similar war powers in the Caribbean failed narrowly, but bipartisan support from Republicans like Paul and Murkowski shows some resistance. The article highlights concerns over lack of transparency, constitutional overreach, and the potential for escalating military engagement in Venezuela without public debate or legislative approval.",
