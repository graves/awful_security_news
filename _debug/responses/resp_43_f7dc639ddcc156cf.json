  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the administration now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. A previously hoped-for call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, intended to lay the groundwork, was deemed insufficient due to divergent positions on ending the war in Ukraine and the lack of meaningful policy shifts from Moscow. The Kremlin has rejected proposals to freeze the war, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has argued that the U.S. refusal to supply long-range missiles to Ukraine has led Russia to reduce diplomatic engagement. While the White House maintains Trump’s commitment to peace, the absence of high-level engagement with Putin and the limited influence of Lavrov suggest that progress on a diplomatic resolution remains stalled. Future discussions may occur at a side event of an ASEAN-led meeting, but no immediate summit appears likely.",
