  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study found that early introduction of peanuts to infants significantly reduces the risk of developing peanut allergies, new research confirms that this public health strategy is making a measurable impact in the U.S. Since 2015, peanut allergy rates in children under age 3 have declined by more than 27% and by over 40% after expanded guidelines in 2017. The findings are based on an analysis of electronic health records from pediatric practices and show that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since the recommendations were adopted. The key scientific foundation comes from the LEAP trial led by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, which demonstrated that early peanut exposure reduces future allergy risk by more than 80%. Despite initial adoption challenges, with only 29% of pediatricians following the guidelines, the new data shows increasing real-world implementation and positive outcomes. Experts like Dr. David Hill and advocates from FARE emphasize that introducing allergens like peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, or soy-based products between 4 and 6 months of age is safe and effective, with no need for prior screening.",
