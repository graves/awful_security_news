  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Pentagon under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has systematically sidelined senior military lawyers, including Lt. Gen. Joe Berger and Lt. Gen. Charles Plummer, by firing them and demoting top legal ranks to two-star generals. This move, supported by personal legal advisors like Tim Parlatore, undermines the traditional role of military lawyers as independent legal advisors. Concerns were raised about the legality of using National Guard troops for immigration enforcement, mass firings of civil servants, and U.S. strikes in the Caribbean. Legal experts like Michael D’Annunzio have voiced objections to these actions, but are being removed from key positions. The broader trend reflects a political shift where military legal advice is being subordinated to political directives, raising alarms among current and former JAG officers about the erosion of the rule of law in military operations.",
