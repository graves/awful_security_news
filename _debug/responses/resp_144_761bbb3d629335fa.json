The missiles traveled approximately 350km and landed inland, contrary to initial expectations. These launches are seen by experts as a deliberate assertion by Kim Jong Un to assert North Korea’s status as a nuclear-armed state during a major international diplomatic event. The timing coincides with North Korea’s display of its Hwasong-20 missile during a military parade, signaling broader military advancement. South Korea has heightened military readiness and is coordinating with the U.S. and Japan, while experts suggest the actions are designed to pressure allies and demonstrate strategic strength amid regional tensions. North Korea continues to reject international arms bans, claiming self-defense against U.S. and South Korean threats. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled interest in future talks with Kim, though North Korea insists on retaining its nuclear arsenal.",
