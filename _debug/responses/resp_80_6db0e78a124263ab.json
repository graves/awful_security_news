  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a highly timed phone call with US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts to avert a dangerous escalation by urging the US to abandon plans to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could target major Russian cities. Putin frames the call as 'positive and productive,' highlighting the value of trust and personal diplomacy, and praises Trump’s success in the Middle East. A second summit in Budapest, Hungary, is agreed upon, offering renewed hope for peace talks in Ukraine. However, Russia has not indicated any willingness to compromise on its maximalist goals, including control over annexed Ukrainian territory and postwar constraints on Ukraine's autonomy. The article underscores how the Kremlin’s strategic use of personal engagement may be more effective than concessions, and how Trump’s recent success in Gaza may increase his inclination toward a Ukrainian peace deal.",
