  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown, national parks and tourism sites across the U.S. face significant challenges. Despite federal furloughs of 9,000 National Park Service employees, many parks remain open using state funds—such as in West Virginia—leading to increased tourism but raising serious safety and environmental concerns. Visitors report gaining access without fees, but incidents of illegal activities like drone flights and base jumping have increased. Local businesses show mixed results: some report no impact, while others like Mountain Mama in Harpers Ferry see a 30% drop in bookings. Meanwhile, private museums in Washington, D.C., have seen a surge in visitors, partially offsetting losses from federal closures. Advocacy groups warn that the absence of rangers undermines safety, emergency response, and environmental stewardship, with trash and vandalism becoming more common. The article underscores the tension between maintaining public access and protecting park ecosystems and visitor safety during political gridlock.",
