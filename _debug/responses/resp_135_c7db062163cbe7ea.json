  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current climate commitments, the world will face an additional 57 superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerously hot weather. This represents a significant reduction from the pre-Paris scenario of 114 extra superhot days under a 4°C warming path. The study highlights a profound global injustice: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa — which produce negligible emissions — will experience massive spikes in heat exposure, while major emitters like the U.S., China, and India face only a fraction of the increase. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequalities and threaten geopolitical stability.",
