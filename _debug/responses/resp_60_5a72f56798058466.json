  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In response to growing political interference and declining public trust in federal public health guidance, the Big Cities Health Coalition — a group of public health leaders from major U.S. cities — has issued a public appeal urging vaccination. The coalition highlights the increasing frequency of measles and respiratory virus outbreaks, citing false claims by former President Donald Trump and recent CDC recommendations against the MMRV vaccine for children under 4. These changes have led to a sharp drop in public trust, as shown by a KFF poll finding only 50% of Americans trust the CDC. Local officials, such as Dr. Phil Huang and Dr. Raynard Washington, stress that public health is a shared responsibility, with interconnected communities making local actions critical to national outcomes. The outbreak in upstate South Carolina involving over 100 quarantined unvaccinated students underscores the urgency. While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services claims to be restoring trust by removing political influence, the article reveals a deepening crisis of trust, coordination, and scientific integrity in national public health policy.",
