  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from Bolivia’s Christian Democratic Party (PDC), won the presidential runoff election with 54.5% of the vote, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS). The election was driven by Bolivia’s severe economic crisis — including high inflation, declining natural gas exports, and fuel scarcity — which led to widespread voter disillusionment with the MAS government. Paz’s moderate platform, emphasizing private sector growth and gradual reform, appealed to left-leaning voters wary of radical austerity. His running mate, Edman Lara, contributed to his appeal among younger and working-class voters. Despite winning a plurality in the legislature, Paz lacks a majority and must form alliances to govern. He has pledged to address fuel shortages through deferred payments and phase out universal fuel subsidies in favor of targeted support. The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including securing fuel supplies, navigating a fragmented legislature, and avoiding labor union opposition.
