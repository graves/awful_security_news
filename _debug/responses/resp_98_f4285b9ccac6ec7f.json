  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, expanded her temporary restraining order against federal immigration and border enforcement agents in Chicago, requiring all agents in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during protests. The order prohibits the use of tear gas, pepper balls, flash-bang grenades, and vehicles through crowds, emphasizing that such tactics violate constitutional rights of peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and clergy. Judge Ellis expressed serious concerns that the Trump administration is not complying with her directives, citing media reports of aggressive actions like tear gas deployment without warnings and pepper balls fired at press and religious figures. Despite DHS and DOJ arguments that body camera implementation is logistically difficult, the judge insisted on transparency. The case has intensified tensions between federal agencies, with FBI and immigration agents reporting friction over camera use and tactics. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker endorsed the order, and a federal appellate court blocked a National Guard deployment in Illinois, citing unreliable assessments of unrest. The incident reflects broader concerns about the militarization of federal enforcement and accountability in urban protest environments.",
