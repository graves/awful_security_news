  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new marine species during a 2022 deep-sea expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park, off the coast of Western Australia. A semi-transparent porcelain crab, about 1.5cm long, was found at 122 meters depth, using hairs to filter feed on plankton, while a new lantern shark species, the West Australian Lantern Shark, was discovered over 600 meters below sea level with a glowing belly. These findings highlight the rich, unexplored biodiversity of Australiaâ€™s deep-sea regions, a global biodiversity hotspot. So far, 20 new species have been formally described, with scientists estimating up to 600 more to be identified in the future due to the lengthy process required to verify species uniqueness.",
