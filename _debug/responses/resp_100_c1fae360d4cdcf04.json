  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On Saturday, October 18, 2025, millions of people are expected to join peaceful protests across the United States under the banner of the No Kings movement, which criticizes President Trump for acting like a monarch rather than a democratic leader. The protests follow a June 2025 demonstration that drew over 5 million participants, in response to Trump’s military parade on his 79th birthday and subsequent policies, including immigration detentions, cuts to education and environmental protections, and gerrymandering. Despite criticism from political leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican governors Glenn Youngkin and Greg Abbott, who have called the events anti-American and mobilized National Guard forces, organizers stress the peaceful and unifying nature of the demonstrations. The movement aims to assert democratic values and resist what it sees as authoritarian governance, highlighting a significant moment of civic engagement in U.S. political life.",
