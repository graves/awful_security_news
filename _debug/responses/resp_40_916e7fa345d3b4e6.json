  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A powerful storm driven by Typhoon Halong, behaving like a Category 2 hurricane, caused catastrophic flooding in remote Alaska villages, particularly in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, destroying 90% of homes in Kipnuk and damaging over one-third in Kwigillingok. Over 2,000 people were displaced, with many evacuated by military aircraft to Anchorage, where they are being housed in temporary facilities like a sports arena and university center. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to access federal aid for emergency and long-term recovery, citing that many residents may not return home for at least 18 months due to the scale of destruction and the region’s harsh climate. Personal accounts from residents such as Alexie Stone and Nellie Unangiq Jimmie highlight the emotional and lifestyle upheaval caused by the disaster, while Anchorage leaders emphasize regional solidarity and support. The incident underscores the vulnerability of isolated Arctic communities to extreme weather events and the need for robust emergency preparedness and intergovernmental cooperation.",
