  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores how Donald Trump has made 'common sense' a central rhetorical tool in his political communication, using it to justify controversial policies, discredit opponents, and appeal to rural and older voters. Rooted in Thomas Paine’s 1776 pamphlet, the phrase has evolved into a populist device that contrasts 'ordinary people's lived experience' with academic or elite perspectives. While Democrats have also used 'common sense' to advocate for reforms like gun safety and healthcare, Trump’s usage is more frequent and demagogic, often implying that opposing viewpoints are ideologically driven or nonsensical. The article highlights how the phrase, though historically grounded, is now a powerful instrument of political rhetoric, especially within the MAGA movement, enabling Trump to rationalize norm-breaking actions like deploying National Guard forces to cities.",
