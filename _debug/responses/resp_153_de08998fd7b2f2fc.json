    "China has expanded its export controls on rare-earth metals, restricting 12 out of the 17 known rare-earth elements, including five new metals: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium.",
    "The restrictions apply to both rare-earth metals and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain special approvals from Beijing for exports involving products with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content.",
    "The controls are justified on national security grounds, citing dual-use applications of rare-earth materials in both civilian and military technologies, and alleged transfers of controlled materials to sensitive military users.",
    "The US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million in 2023, with 70% of its rare-earth imports sourced from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for advanced technologies, including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, LED screens, camera lenses, F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, radar systems, and AI semiconductors.",
    "China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, mining at least 60% and processing about 90% of global supply.",
    "The move is seen as strategic leverage ahead of a Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit in South Korea, signaling China's willingness to weaponize its dominance in the rare-earth supply chain.",
    "Analysts note that while the restrictions may harm US defence and technology sectors, they also reflect the deep economic interdependence between the US and China, as supply chains operate bilaterally.",
    "Exemptions exist for exports related to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has announced expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), effective from December 1, 2025. The restrictions apply to both the metals and specialized refining equipment, requiring foreign companies to obtain Beijing-approved licenses detailing the intended use of the products. China cites national security and dual-use applications as justification, especially after detecting transfers of controlled materials to military users. The move comes just weeks before a high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, suggesting a strategic attempt to strengthen China’s leverage during negotiations. The US, which imported $22.8 million in rare-earth products from China in 2023 and relied on 70% of its rare-earth supply, is particularly vulnerable. These metals are essential for defence systems such as F-35 jets, submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors, making the controls a critical point of strategic competition. Analysts interpret the action as a deliberate signaling effort, indicating China’s willingness to weaponize its supply chain dominance, while also highlighting the deep economic interdependence between the US and China.",
