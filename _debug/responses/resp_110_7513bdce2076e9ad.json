  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the U.S. government remains shut down due to a failed spending bill, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries argues that public pressure will compel Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment on November 1, 2025. Without the subsidies, tens of millions of Americans—especially those with incomes at or below $63,000—face potentially unaffordable insurance premiums, with monthly costs rising by up to $2,000, which could reach over $24,000 annually. Jeffries opposes a Republican one-year extension of subsidies, calling it insufficient and highlighting that such policies have been used to provide permanent tax breaks to billionaires while cutting Medicaid, endangering access to care. He criticizes GOP proposals to pay only military or essential workers as 'political ploys' that allow arbitrary discretion and neglect civil servants. The open enrollment period from November 1 to mid-December is critical, as public awareness of rising costs will grow, leading to widespread demand for action. Jeffries insists that extending ACA subsidies is not only a health issue but a moral imperative to protect working-class Americans from financial ruin.",
