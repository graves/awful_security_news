Hemani’s legal team argues that the law is overly broad and could unfairly target millions of Americans, given that about 20% of U.S. adults have used marijuana. The government counters that regular drug users pose a public safety risk, citing the FBI’s discovery of a gun and cocaine in Hemani’s home. The case is expected to be argued in early 2026 and a decision issued by early summer 2026, and it reflects a broader national tension between gun rights, drug policy, and constitutional interpretation.",
