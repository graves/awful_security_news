  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In late 2025, a wave of 'No Kings' protests drew millions of Americans to peaceful demonstrations across 50 states, expressing concern over President Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic behavior. Trump and Vice President JD Vance responded with AI-generated memes depicting Trump as a king, mocking protesters and reinforcing the narrative that he wields unchecked power. The article highlights Trump’s controversial pardon of George Santos, his demand for charges against James Comey and Letitia James, and the unilateral military actions in Venezuela and the Caribbean—all of which are seen as unconstitutional and imperial. The administration’s dismissal of protesters and suppression of media scrutiny further signal a growing erosion of democratic norms. Despite Trump’s claims that the protests are 'a joke,' the scale and sincerity of the demonstrations—led by diverse and moderate Americans—suggest a national awakening against authoritarianism, reinforcing the protesters’ central argument that Trump is acting like a king and undermining constitutional democracy.",
