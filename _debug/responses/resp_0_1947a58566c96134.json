  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large-scale military demonstration involving live fire, fighter jets, and naval vessels. The event sparked controversy when Governor Gavin Newsom closed Interstate 5 due to safety concerns, arguing that live rounds over a busy highway posed extreme risks. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the demonstration, emphasizing military unity and rejecting the idea that diversity strengthens the armed forces. The event occurred during a federal government shutdown, with the Department of Defense continuing to pay military personnel using unobligated funds. The clash reflects broader political tensions between military tradition and civilian safety, as well as between the Trump administration’s policy of rolling back diversity initiatives and state-level governance.",
