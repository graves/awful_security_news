  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, with forecasted heavy rainfall and coastal flooding due to waves up to 1.2 meters. The government has activated evacuation plans for high-risk areas, including coastal zones and landslide-prone slopes, reflecting a recurring pattern where Catanduanes is often the first landmass affected by cyclones in the western Pacific. This event occurs amid a broader crisis in the Philippines, which has recently endured multiple disasters, including deadly earthquakes and typhoons. Scientists have linked increasing storm intensity to climate change, suggesting that global warming is intensifying extreme weather events. The countryâ€™s ongoing recovery from these disasters underscores the urgent need for resilient infrastructure and improved disaster preparedness in vulnerable, impoverished communities.",
