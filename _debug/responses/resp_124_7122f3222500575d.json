  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a case concerning whether individuals who regularly use marijuana can legally own firearms, following a 2022 ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a Texas man whose felony gun charge was dismissed by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the federal ban on firearm possession for drug users to be unconstitutional. The Justice Department is appealing the decision, asserting that regular drug users pose a public safety risk and that the law is valid when applied to such individuals. The Trump administration supports the case, emphasizing Second Amendment rights, while Hemani’s attorneys argue that the law risks criminalizing millions of Americans, especially given that marijuana use is common and legal in half of U.S. states. Arguments are expected in early 2026, with a decision likely by early summer. This case represents a significant legal and political flashpoint in the intersection of drug policy and gun rights in the United States.",
