  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to end the war, including surrendering parts of the Donbas region in exchange for Russian-held areas in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The meeting, which took place on Friday, October 17, 2025, followed a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a similar territorial swap. Trump later clarified that he did not demand full surrender of Donbas, instead advocating a ceasefire at current battle lines, citing the 'realities' of the war and concern over escalating violence. Zelensky expressed pessimism about Trump’s position, describing the meeting as tense but constructive, with both sides agreeing on a ceasefire at existing frontlines. This marks a shift from Trump’s earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory, and comes amid his broader focus on ending conflicts, including the Gaza war. The episode reflects deep disagreements over how to end the war and underscores the delicate balance of power and diplomacy in international conflict resolution.",
