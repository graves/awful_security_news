The fighting, which began on October 10, 2025, stemmed from accusations from Afghanistan that Pakistan conducted airstrikes on Afghan territory, particularly in Paktika province, while Pakistan claimed it targeted verified militant camps and denied targeting civilians. The Taliban leadership, through spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, affirmed a mutual commitment to stop attacks on civilians, security forces, and critical infrastructure. Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, denied allegations of civilian harm and reported that Pakistani forces repelled attacks that killed over 100 militants.

This escalation marks the worst violence between the two neighbors since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, raising serious concerns about regional stability and security, especially given the long-standing rivalry and the presence of militant groups like the TTP.",
