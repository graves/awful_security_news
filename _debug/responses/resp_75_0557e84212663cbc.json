  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon used in multiple conflicts, remains a sought-after tool for Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly advocated for its delivery to target critical Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov. However, the U.S. administration, under Donald Trump, has stated it has limited Tomahawks available and prioritizes their use for domestic security, citing national defense needs. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launch system (Typhon) to deploy Tomahawks from its territory, and its domestic missile project, the Flamingo, remains unproven and underdeveloped. Russia has warned that supplying Tomahawks would be a hostile act, potentially triggering escalation, especially due to the missile’s nuclear-capability potential. While a few dozen Tomahawks could inflict significant damage, hundreds would be needed to cripple key Russian facilities. Ultimately, Ukraine’s most pressing need remains enhanced air defense systems to counter Russia’s missile and drone attacks, rather than long-range strike capabilities.",
