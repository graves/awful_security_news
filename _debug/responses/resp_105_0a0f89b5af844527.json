  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge has ordered the return of books on race and gender to school libraries on military bases, following a legal challenge by students and civil rights groups. The removals, driven by Department of Defense policies under former President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that prohibit instruction on Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, and identity-related events, led to canceled school activities and fear among students. The judge ruled that the book removals were not pedagogical but politically motivated, violating studentsâ€™ First Amendment rights and undermining free expression in education. This decision highlights a growing conflict between federal education policy and constitutional protections for free speech, particularly in military-affiliated schools abroad.",
