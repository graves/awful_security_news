  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey is facing criminal charges for allegedly lying during congressional testimony about President Donald Trump, and has launched a legal defense arguing that the prosecution is the result of a personal vendetta by Trump and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was unlawful, as it circumvented Senate confirmation requirements under the U.S. Constitution. Comey’s attorneys claim that Trump has repeatedly targeted him for criticizing the president, citing public statements as evidence of retaliation. They also argue that the Justice Department’s decision not to pursue similar charges against other top Trump administration officials demonstrates selective prosecution. The case raises significant constitutional and political questions about executive overreach, retaliation against protected speech, and the legitimacy of prosecutorial appointments, with legal experts suggesting that judges may be more receptive due to the public nature of the animosity between Trump and Comey.",
