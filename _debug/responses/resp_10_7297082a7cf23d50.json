  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s plans for a swift summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin may be delayed due to a postponed pre-meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The two officials have divergent views on ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Trump administration believes Lavrov is not a meaningful actor in key policy decisions, as he is loyal to Putin and rarely participates in real strategic discussions. Despite this, talks between Rubio and Lavrov remain ongoing, with a possible future meeting at an ASEAN-led global leaders’ gathering in Malaysia. The Kremlin insists that the summit cannot be postponed, as no date was set, while Trump continues to call for an immediate ceasefire along the battle line. The article highlights the broader challenge of diplomatic progress in a war where key intermediaries like Lavrov are seen as ineffective, raising questions about whether meaningful peace talks between Trump and Putin can advance.",
