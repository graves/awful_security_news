The Denver Broncos made history by overcoming a 19-point deficit to defeat the New York Giants 33-32, becoming the first team since 2007 to reverse such a lead after three quarters. Second-year quarterback Bo Nix delivered a historic performance, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two scores, and sealing the win with a game-winning field goal. Meanwhile, Drake Maye broke Tom Brady's franchise record with a 91.3% completion rate in a 31-13 win over the Tennessee Titans, becoming the first player in Super Bowl era history to complete 90% of his passes, throw over 200 yards, and rush over 50 yards in a single game. In contrast, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets faced severe setbacks, with Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Fields both benched due to poor performances, signaling instability in both teams' offenses. The Jets’ first-year head coach Aaron Glenn cited a need for a 'spark' after the offensive collapse, while the Dolphins’ coaching staff opted to bring in rookie Quinn Ewers. The Packers also emerged victorious over the Cardinals, aided by defensive dominance from Micah Parsons, who recorded a crucial third sack on Arizona’s final drive. These events underscore the growing unpredictability and volatility of the NFL season, emphasizing the importance of resilience, quarterback adaptability, and team cohesion.",
