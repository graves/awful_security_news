  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ian Roberts, the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for unlawfully possessing firearms while illegally present in the United States. Originally from Guyana, Roberts was detained by ICE on September 26, 2025, fled in a district-issued vehicle, and was later found with a handgun and several other weapons at his home. Authorities state that he made a false attestation on an employment eligibility form, and an immigration judge issued a final removal order, which was upheld after an appeal. The incident has led to significant fallout, including a lawsuit filed by the school district against the consulting firm that facilitated the hiring process and a review of Roberts’ expenditures by school board chair Jackie Norris, who also ended her campaign for U.S. Senate.",
