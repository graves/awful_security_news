  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central reveals that even under current global climate commitments, the planet will face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures — due to climate change. This represents a significant reduction from the pre-Paris 4C warming scenario, which would have added 114 such days. However, scientists emphasize that the impacts are deeply unequal: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa face dramatic increases in heat exposure — with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days — while major emitters like the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 more, despite being responsible for 42% of global emissions. Experts warn that such disparities exacerbate global inequalities and could fuel geopolitical tensions, with tens of thousands or millions of people at risk of health impacts from extreme heat, especially in vulnerable regions.",
