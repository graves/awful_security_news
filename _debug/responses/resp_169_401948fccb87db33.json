  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made false claims linking autism to circumcision and acetaminophen, citing two flawed studies from 2013 and 2015. Experts clarify that neither study established causation, had significant methodological limitations—including small sample sizes and lack of data on acetaminophen use—and both explicitly cautioned against drawing causal conclusions. A 2025 preprint from WPLab, not peer-reviewed and promoted by a company with ties to Kennedy, falsely asserts that acetaminophen triggers autism. Decades of research confirm that acetaminophen is safe for infants when used as recommended. The article underscores the danger of misrepresenting scientific studies and highlights the importance of peer review, data transparency, and scientific consensus in public health discourse.",
