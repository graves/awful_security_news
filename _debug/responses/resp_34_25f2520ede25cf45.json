  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Advances in artificial intelligence are driving a surge in demand for data centers, which require vast land and energy, leading to rising carbon emissions. As terrestrial solutions face constraints, companies and governments are exploring space-based data centers as a solution, leveraging continuous solar access and potential protection from disasters. Projects like the European ASCEND initiative and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are advancing the feasibility of this concept through technical demonstrations and launches. While companies like SpaceX and Sidus provide launch infrastructure, experts remain skeptical due to high costs, radiation risks, heat dissipation challenges, and the dangers of space debris and counterspace threats. Despite these challenges, proponents argue that space-based computing is a necessary evolution to avoid technological stagnation and resource exhaustion, with significant milestones expected in 2025–2027.",
