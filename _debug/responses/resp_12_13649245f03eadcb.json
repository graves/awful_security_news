  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the government shutdown enters its third week, over 1.4 million federal employees—including contractors and staff from the Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, and Social Security Administration—have been furloughed or are working without pay. In response, a food bank event in Landover, Maryland, organized by the Capital Area Food Bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries, served more than 370 households—double the expected number—highlighting the severe financial strain on federal workers. Participants like Summer Kerksick and Rolanda Williams describe the emotional and economic shock of losing job security, with one noting that their initial assumption of federal job safety has been shattered. Lawmakers remain divided, with GOP Senator Ron Johnson proposing partial payments for those still working, while Democrats call for full compensation for all federal workers. The event underscores both the human cost of political gridlock and the growing need for emergency support among public sector employees.",
