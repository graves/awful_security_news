  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under a Gaza ceasefire agreement, Israel and Hamas have exchanged the remains of 15 Israeli captives, including two identified as Aryeh Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar. Despite these exchanges, Hamas accuses Israel of violating the ceasefire by refusing to reopen the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since May 2024. The closure restricts humanitarian aid and medical access to Gaza, drawing criticism from the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, which ordered the crossing reopened. Palestinian officials, including Ubai Al-Aboudi of the Bisan Center, argue that Palestinian detainees are effectively 'hostages' due to lack of due process and physical abuse. The ICRC and Hamas organized the body handovers, while approximately 20% of the Palestinian population remains detained. Around 13 more sets of remains are expected to be returned, though recovery is hindered by ongoing conflict and Israeli control of Gaza. The ceasefire, originally supported by Turkey and the US under former President Donald Trump, remains under strain due to unfulfilled humanitarian obligations.",
