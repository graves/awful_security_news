  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College. For over a decade, the case remained unresolved due to a lack of prosecution and the destruction of evidence. In 2019, Cleary sent a Facebook message saying 'So I raped you', prompting Keeler to renew her efforts. After a three-year search, Cleary was extradited from France in 2024, where he had been detained on a vagrancy charge. At a sentencing hearing in October 2025, he was given a two to four-year prison sentence, below state guidelines, due to his guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. Keeler, who has spent 12 years pursuing justice, described the case as a turning point where the justice system finally delivered accountability — though at a personal and emotional cost. The case highlights broader systemic failures in campus sexual assault investigations, including prosecutorial reluctance and loss of evidence.",
