    "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 10% to 15% of all new diagnoses, with about 47,500 cases diagnosed annually in the U.S.",
    "ILC is particularly difficult to detect via routine mammograms because it grows as thin strands that blend into normal breast tissue, often showing no structural changes.",
    "The rise in ILC cases has outpaced all other breast cancers combined, increasing at 2.8% per year, while other types increased at just 0.8% per year.",
    "The steepest increase in ILC incidence was observed among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, with a 4.4% annual rise, indicating a growing disparity in breast cancer trends across ethnic groups.",
    "Women aged 65 and older are at higher risk, with 70% of new ILC cases diagnosed in women 60 and older and a median age of diagnosis at 66.",
    "ILC is often hormone receptor-positive, meaning it grows in response to estrogen or progesterone, which influences treatment and prognosis.",
    "Treatment typically includes surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy or targeted therapy for advanced cases.",
    "ILC may have a poorer prognosis when it spreads, and it tends to be more resistant to treatment than other types of breast cancer.",
    "Risk reduction strategies include quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and staying physically active.",
    "Women at higher risk—such as those with dense breasts or genetic mutations—may benefit from supplemental screening using ultrasound or MRI in addition to mammograms."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in the journal Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)—a second-most common type of breast cancer—has increased in the U.S. at nearly four times the rate of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade. The study, analyzing data from 2012 to 2021, found ILC rates rising by 2.8% annually, while other breast cancers rose by only 0.8%. ILC is difficult to detect via routine mammograms due to its subtle, diffuse growth pattern that mimics normal breast tissue. The steepest increase was seen in Asian American and Pacific Islander women, and most cases are diagnosed in women aged 60 and older. ILC is often hormone receptor-positive, influencing treatment with hormonal therapy. Experts, including Dr. Leana Wen, suggest rising obesity, alcohol use, and changes in reproductive patterns may be contributing factors. Early detection relies on supplemental screening tools like ultrasound or MRI for at-risk individuals. The article emphasizes that lifestyle modifications and increased awareness are key to reducing risk and improving outcomes for women at higher risk.",
