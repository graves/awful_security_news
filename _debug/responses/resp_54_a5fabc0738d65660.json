  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions—specifically, giving up parts of the Donbas region—to end the war, contradicting his earlier claim that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. The meeting, described by European officials as tense and frank, included Trump's insistence on a ceasefire along current battle lines, which he said would prevent further loss of life. Trump denied demanding a full surrender of Donbas, stating that 78% of Ukraine’s land is already occupied. Despite the tension, Zelensky viewed the dialogue as constructive and said it could help bring peace. The incident reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to peace, influenced by his recent success in brokering a Gaza truce and concerns over the war's human toll. A proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin for Ukraine to surrender Donbas in exchange for Russian-held southern regions was also discussed, underscoring the complexity of negotiations. Ultimately, both leaders agreed on a ceasefire at current battle lines, though the underlying conflict over territorial integrity remains unresolved.",
