The attack, which took place during the museum’s opening, involved the use of a truck-mounted ladder, an angle grinder to break a window, and a coordinated team of four armed with tools and communication devices. Among the stolen items were a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, and a crown from Empress Eugénie, which was damaged during the theft. One item, the crown of Empress Eugénie, was found abandoned and damaged. The museum remained closed for security reasons, and authorities have opened an investigation into organized gang activity and possible foreign interference. French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and Culture Minister Rachida Dati, condemned the act as a serious attack on national heritage. Experts warn that if the stolen items are melted or recut, irreplaceable cultural value will be lost forever. The incident is described as unprecedented in the Louvre’s history, with no prior robbery in over a century.",
