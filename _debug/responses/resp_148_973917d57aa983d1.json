  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the Diwali festival in October 2025, New Delhi experienced one of the most hazardous air pollution events globally, with its air quality index (AQI) reaching 442 due to widespread fireworks and seasonal smog. The concentration of PM2.5 particles exceeded 59 times the World Health Organization’s recommended annual limit, prompting the Central Pollution Control Board to classify the air as 'very poor'. Despite a Supreme Court permit for limited use of 'green crackers', fireworks were set off beyond the allowed times, worsening pollution. The situation is compounded by cold, stagnant air that traps emissions from traffic, industry, and agricultural fires in Punjab, India. Transboundary pollution is evident in Lahore, Pakistan, where AQI reached 234, indicating shared regional environmental challenges. Authorities have previously responded with school closures and vehicle restrictions, but long-term solutions remain elusive, highlighting a persistent threat to public health across South Asia.",
