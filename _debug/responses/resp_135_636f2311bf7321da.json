  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch investigation reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be fueling deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from illegal ranches operating within protected areas. The report focuses on Pará, Brazil, where deforestation has surged—especially in 2024—and where state agency Adepará has approved cattle transport in protected Indigenous and sustainable zones without environmental oversight. Cattle are allegedly moved through a 'laundering' system using group-level animal transit permits (GTAs), which do not track individual animals, allowing their illegal origins to remain hidden. Despite JBS’s past promises (such as the 2009 G4 Cattle Agreement), it has failed to fully trace its supply chain, raising concerns about its responsibility for deforestation. Experts and advocacy groups stress that voluntary corporate commitments are insufficient and call for immediate, enforceable federal reforms, including public access to GTA data and mandatory national traceability systems. With COP30 approaching, the report underscores urgent global concern over the role of meat supply chains in environmental degradation.",
