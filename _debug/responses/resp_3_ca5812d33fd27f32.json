  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 22, 2025, Hamas returned the bodies of two deceased hostages—Arye Zalmanovich, the oldest hostage taken during the October 7, 2023 attacks, and Tamir Adar, a defender who died in the initial assault—to Israel for identification. Zalmanovich, 85, was a founding member of Kibbutz Nir Oz and a farmer; Adar, 38, died defending his community. The return is part of a US-proposed ceasefire agreement signed on October 9, 2025, which required the return of all deceased hostages within 72 hours. However, challenges remain, including the misidentification of a body and the difficulty of recovering bodies buried under rubble. US Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the difficulty of the process but emphasized the importance of retrieving remains for family closure. The IDF confirmed identification, and Israeli officials expressed deep sorrow for the families of the fallen.",
