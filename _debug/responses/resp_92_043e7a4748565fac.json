  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following the death of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who died in India at 80 after a morning walk, Kenya declared a seven-day national mourning period. Thousands of mourners gathered at a 60,000-capacity football stadium in Nairobi for a public viewing, where tensions rose when they breached the presidential pavilion, prompting police to fire tear gas and leading to a stampede and injuries. President William Ruto praised Odinga as a patriot and unifier, while the country held additional public viewings in Kisumu and declared Friday a public holiday. Odinga, a long-time democratic figure and former prime minister, had campaigned for the presidency five times and played a key role in Kenya’s transition to multiparty democracy, including mediating the 2008 unity government. His request for a rapid burial, typical of a non-traditional state funeral, underscores his personal wishes amid public reverence.",
