  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the growing global threat posed by drones, especially in civilian and critical infrastructure settings. It highlights how technologies like radio frequency jamming (used by MyDefence) and interception systems (such as those from Nordic Air Defence) are being developed and deployed. Experts emphasize that detecting small, hard-to-identify drones using traditional radar is difficult, prompting the need for multi-sensor systems including acoustic sensors and advanced radars. The war in Ukraine has accelerated innovation in anti-drone defense, particularly in jamming and autonomous drone control. However, a major concern is the cost mismatch: cheap drones can be produced rapidly, while defensive systems remain expensive. As a result, there is a pressing need for affordable, scalable, and safe methods such as soft-kill tactics (e.g., hacking), low-cost interceptors, and net-based systems. Civilian sectors like shipping and offshore oil are increasingly at risk, prompting calls for a centralized drone traffic management system with electronic registration and flight tracking to distinguish legal from unauthorized drones. Incidents in Poland, Romania, Norway, Germany, and Denmark illustrate the widespread nature of these threats, leading to national investments and military deployments to counter them.",
