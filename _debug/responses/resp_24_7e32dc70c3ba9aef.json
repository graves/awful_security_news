  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a live-fire demonstration marking the 250th birthday of the US Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate highway, resulting in shrapnel damaging a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. The incident occurred despite the Marine Corps asserting that such high-firing over a highway was a safe practice, as shells were fired at high altitudes. The shell was part of a batch that had previously been used successfully in training, raising questions about its reliability. The demonstration was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and while no injuries were reported, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as dangerous and closed I-5 in advance. The incident has prompted a Marine Corps investigation into the shell’s manufacturing and usage, with concerns raised over past issues revealed in a 2024 Reuters investigation into shell production, including cracked shells and a shift in explosive type. The US has significantly increased 155mm shell production since 2022 to support Ukraine’s war effort, and the shell batch in question was temporarily frozen after the incident.",
