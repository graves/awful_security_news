  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article by Jeanne Sahadi for CNN promotes the KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investing strategy, arguing that most actively managed funds fail to outperform low-cost index funds over time—only 21% of active funds outperformed passive ones over 10 years, and just 7.1% over 20 years. Experts like Amy Arnott of Morningstar emphasize that simplicity reduces decision fatigue, improves transparency, and ensures easier portfolio management—especially during retirement or cognitive decline. The article recommends target-date retirement funds or a minimal portfolio of U.S. stocks, international stocks, and bonds for most investors, with intermediate-term goals supported by bond funds. Ultimately, the strategy is not about maximizing returns but about reducing complexity and ensuring long-term financial stability through consistent saving and simple, transparent investing.",
