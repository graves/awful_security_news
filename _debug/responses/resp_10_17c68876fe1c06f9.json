  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge in Chicago, US District Judge Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal officials over their alleged violations of her order to restrict the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests. The order, issued in response to public reports, requires agents to wear body-worn cameras and provide warnings before deploying crowd control tactics. The Trump administration’s Operation Midway Blitz, which led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, has drawn scrutiny for allegedly deploying tear gas without warning. Officials, including CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, testified, but the judge expressed serious concerns about non-compliance, stating she is not satisfied with the transparency and accountability provided. Protests continue at the Broadview ICE facility, with demonstrators and arrests indicating ongoing resistance to immigration enforcement actions.",
