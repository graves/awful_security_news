  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recent military operation in the Caribbean, the United States conducted a strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel, resulting in the deaths of at least 29 people and the survival of two individuals. President Donald Trump announced that the two survivors will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for detention and prosecution, thereby avoiding legal ambiguity in U.S. jurisdiction. The vessel was confirmed to carry mostly fentanyl and other narcotics, with U.S. intelligence indicating it was on a known drug trafficking route. This action is part of a broader campaign framed by Trump as an 'armed conflict' with drug cartels, drawing legal comparisons to the Bush administration's war on terrorism, raising concerns about the use of military force in civilian maritime zones.",
