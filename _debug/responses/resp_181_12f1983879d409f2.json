  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the growing global threat of drones, particularly in civilian and critical infrastructure settings. It highlights how technologies such as electronic jamming (e.g., from MyDefence) and low-cost interceptors (e.g., from Nordic Air Defence) are being developed to detect, disable, and neutralize drones. Detection remains a challenge due to small size and materials, but innovations like acoustic sensors and advanced radars are helping. The war in Ukraine has accelerated anti-drone technology development, leading to more autonomous and resilient drones, which in turn pushes defense systems to be cheaper, faster, and more accessible. Countries like Sweden, Poland, and Germany have reported drone breaches, prompting national responses and investments. Civilian sectors, including shipping and energy, are increasingly adopting anti-drone solutions due to safety and operational risks. A key future solution proposed is a drone traffic management system with electronic license plates and flight registration to distinguish between legitimate and unauthorized drones, reducing false alarms and enhancing security.",
