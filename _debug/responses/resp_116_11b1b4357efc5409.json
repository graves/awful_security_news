  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, making the civics test more difficult by requiring applicants to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly—twice as many as before—while expanding the question pool from 100 to 128. The new test includes more complex, politically nuanced questions such as why the U.S. entered the Vietnam or Persian Gulf Wars, replacing easier ones about geography or holidays. Applicants must now demonstrate 'good moral character' by providing evidence of positive contributions to American society, with immigration officers potentially conducting interviews with neighbors, coworkers, or family. These changes, announced by USCIS officials and justified as a way to ensure full assimilation and alignment with American values, have sparked criticism from legal experts and advocacy groups who argue that the process is becoming more discriminatory, especially for low-literacy and marginalized populations. Critics, such as University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, claim there is no evidence that the current system allows individuals who don't share core American values to naturalize, and that immigrants and their descendants have historically benefited the U.S. economy and society.",
