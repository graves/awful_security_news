  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Judge Michael Jesic has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time. The brothers, who previously served life without parole, took full responsibility for the killings and testified to their remorse, rehabilitation, and efforts to support prison inmates. Family members and prison acquaintances testified to their personal growth and rehabilitation. However, current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of violence. The parole board will review the request, and Governor Gavin Newsom, who has executive power to grant or deny parole, will ultimately decide. The brothers are also pursuing a new trial via a habeas corpus petition, citing a 1988 letter as new evidence of abuse by their father. This development marks a significant shift in the long-standing legal and public discourse around the case.",
