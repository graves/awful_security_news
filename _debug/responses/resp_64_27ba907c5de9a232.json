  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Admiral Alvin Holsey, who assumed command of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024, is retiring at the end of 2025, one year into his tenure. His departure follows weeks of tension with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the pace and legality of U.S. military operations targeting drug cartels in the Caribbean, including strikes off Venezuela’s coast. The U.S. recently conducted a fifth known drug interdiction strike, killing six people, and President Donald Trump reportedly authorized CIA operations inside Venezuela to curb drug and migrant flows. Holsey, a 37-year Navy veteran with prior command roles, expressed gratitude for his service and the team's contributions. The Pentagon denies Holsey’s claims of operational concerns, and his resignation was delayed and only formally announced after a meeting at the Pentagon on October 6. This reflects broader military restructuring under Hegseth, who has removed several senior officers, highlighting a period of increased military activity and internal friction over legal and strategic boundaries in the region.",
