  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump's administration is engaging in aggressive foreign policy actions toward Venezuela, including military buildups such as U.S. Navy presence and Air Force B-52 bomber flights off the Venezuelan coast, and has authorized covert CIA operations targeting alleged drug boats. These actions, which include open threats of military strikes inside Venezuela, are seen as politically risky and potentially escalatory. The situation has prompted internal tensions, exemplified by the sudden retirement of Admiral Alvin Holsey, who oversaw U.S. Southern Command. Public opinion, as reflected in multiple polls by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Reuters-Ipsos, and others, shows that Americans broadly oppose unilateral military intervention abroad, even in the context of drug trafficking. Despite Trump's claims linking Venezuela to drug flows into the U.S., these claims have been dismissed by judges and intelligence agencies as exaggerated. The article concludes that such actions would likely face significant public opposition and represent a major departure from traditional American non-interventionist norms, especially given the lack of public support for regime change or military intervention in Venezuela.",
