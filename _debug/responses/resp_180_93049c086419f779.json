  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Christopher Moynihan, a 34-year-old man pardoned by former President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a credible threat to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan allegedly planned to target Jeffries during a speech at the Economic Club of New York, expressing in text messages that Jeffries 'must be eliminated' and that he 'will kill him for the future.' This incident comes amid a broader wave of political violence in the U.S., including the killing of a Minnesota lawmaker and the fatal shooting of activist Charlie Kirk. Moynihan, who was sentenced to 21 months in prison for breaching Capitol barricades and taking photos of lawmakers, is being held in Poughkeepsie and has pleaded not guilty. The case raises serious questions about the implications of pardoning individuals involved in violent acts against democratic institutions and the ongoing threat to public safety from political extremism.",
