  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current global commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the Earth will still face 57 additional superhot days per year by 2100 — nearly two months of extreme heat. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 extra days predicted under a pre-Paris 4°C warming scenario, but still poses severe risks. The report emphasizes that climate change impacts are deeply unfair, with small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa facing massive increases in heat days — up to 149 per year — while major polluters such as the U.S., China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn this inequality could exacerbate global tensions and deepen climate injustice, underscoring the urgent need for equitable climate action.",
