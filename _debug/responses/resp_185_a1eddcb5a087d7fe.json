  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the global rise in drone threats and the urgent development of affordable, effective anti-drone technologies. In Denmark, the small company MyDefence has seen a dramatic shift in demand from military to civilian users, particularly from critical infrastructure such as energy and logistics firms. These systems use radio frequency jamming to disrupt drone communication and force them to land safely. However, detecting drones remains difficult due to their size and materials. Experts from the University of Southern Denmark and the Danish Defence Academy stress the importance of early identification and safer 'soft-kill' methods like hacking or controlled landings to avoid dangerous collateral damage. The war in Ukraine has accelerated innovation in both drone use and countermeasures, including jamming and autonomous flight. In response, countries like Sweden have pledged large investments in anti-drone systems, and a proposed drone traffic management system with electronic license plates aims to distinguish legal from unauthorized flights. As drones grow cheaper and more accessible, there is increasing pressure on nations to develop low-cost, scalable defense solutions that can protect both military and civilian assets without risking public safety.",
