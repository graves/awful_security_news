    "The framework would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess CO2 emissions and rewarded ships using cleaner fuel alternatives like ammonia or methanol.",
    "Climate change is already affecting shipping through altered ocean currents and more frequent storms, increasing the urgency for emissions reductions.",
    "The International Chamber of Shipping expressed concern, stating that industry needs clarity to make investments necessary for decarbonization."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global carbon-pricing system designed to reduce shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, following threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The delay, which pushes implementation to late 2025 or early 2026, undermines global climate efforts and reflects a growing geopolitical divide between nations committed to climate action—such as China, the EU, and Britain—and those resistant to carbon pricing, like Russia and Saudi Arabia. The decision was criticized by climate leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, who emphasized the need for clarity and investment in decarbonization. Key emissions-reducing technologies like ammonia and methanol are being explored as alternatives to traditional bunker fuels, but without policy stability, the industry remains uncertain about transitioning to net-zero shipping.",
