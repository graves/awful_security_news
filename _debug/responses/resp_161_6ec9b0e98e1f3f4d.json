  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A growing wave of AI voice scams, including a sophisticated fraud targeting Italian businessmen with deepfake calls from Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, has emerged. The scam, which exploited the realistic quality of modern AI-generated voices, led to financial losses and highlighted public vulnerability. Research from Queen Mary University of London confirms that AI voice clones are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often perceiving them as more trustworthy. The global financial impact is significant—over $547.2 million lost from January to June 2025—while the technology also enables serious ethical abuses such as the creation of child sexual abuse material. Governments, including the U.S. and Australia, are responding with new legal measures to criminalize AI-generated intimate content, underscoring the urgent need for public awareness, regulation, and detection tools.",
