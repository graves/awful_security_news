  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, centered on Trump’s threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China’s retaliatory export controls on rare earth minerals. This follows a long history of tit-for-tat tariffs and export restrictions, including those targeting Huawei and TikTok, and reflects a broader strategic economic rivalry. Both nations are using national security arguments to justify trade actions, with experts noting that China has adopted a more strategic and coordinated approach, while the US has shown greater economic resilience. The situation is set against the backdrop of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea, where the tension may influence diplomatic outcomes. Analysts suggest that neither side is willing to back down, and the outcome will depend on market stability and global economic responses.",
