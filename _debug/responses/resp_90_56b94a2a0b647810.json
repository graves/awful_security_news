    "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, has been a long-standing puzzle in astrophysics.",
    "Scientists have proposed two main explanations: the glow could be from pulsars (rotating remnants of exploded stars) or from annihilating dark matter particles.",
    "The dark matter theory was previously challenged because the glow's shape matched the galactic bulge, which is dominated by old stars and pulsars, suggesting a more spherical distribution from dark matter.",
    "New simulations using supercomputers show that dark matter, when modeled with a squashed or egg-shaped distribution due to galactic formation, can produce a bulge-like glow matching Fermi data, supporting the dark matter hypothesis.",
    "A 50% probability is now assigned to dark matter as the source, according to Joseph Silk, coauthor of the new study published in Physical Review Letters.",
    "The leading dark matter candidate is WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), which annihilate and produce gamma rays when they collide.",
    "The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to launch in 2027, will offer higher-resolution gamma-ray data to definitively confirm or refute the dark matter link.",
    "While the new simulations support the dark matter theory, experts like Tracy Slatyer remain cautious about a definitive match, emphasizing that the mystery remains unresolved.",
    "The search for dark matter has been ongoing since the 1930s, with Fritz Zwicky proposing its existence and Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford providing evidence in the 1970s through galaxy rotation anomalies.",
    "Despite decades of effort, dark matter has never been directly observed, and its nature remains one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in physics."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists have re-evaluated the origin of a mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While pulsars have long been a leading explanation, new supercomputer simulations show that dark matter — specifically, WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) — could produce a bulge-shaped glow due to a squashed, egg-like distribution in the galactic center. This matches the observed shape of the glow, which previously favored pulsar explanations. Joseph Silk, a coauthor of the new study, estimates a 50% chance that dark matter is responsible. However, experts remain cautious, noting the need for higher-resolution data from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), scheduled to start operations in 2027. A definitive confirmation of dark matter would be a breakthrough in physics, resolving a century-old mystery first proposed by Fritz Zwicky and confirmed by Vera Rubin. The article highlights the ongoing scientific effort to detect WIMPs through both space-based and ground-based experiments, emphasizing that while no direct evidence exists yet, the Fermi data keeps the possibility of dark matter in the galactic center alive and the search active.",
