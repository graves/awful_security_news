  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made unsubstantiated claims in October 2025 that circumcised infants have a higher rate of autism, citing two studies — one from 2013 and one from 2015 — and a 2025 preprint from WPLab. Experts including Helen Tager-Flusberg have stated that these studies show only weak correlations, not causation, and that the 2013 and 2015 studies lacked data on acetaminophen use and had significant methodological flaws, such as small sample sizes and failure to account for confounding variables. The 2025 WPLab preprint, not peer-reviewed, promotes a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, which contradicts decades of scientific research showing acetaminophen is safe when used appropriately. The article emphasizes that correlation does not imply causation and that such claims are not supported by the scientific consensus. Kennedy’s claims, which echo those of former President Donald Trump, are criticized as misleading and dangerous, especially given their potential to influence public health decisions.",
