  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A groundbreaking study from King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked the side effects of 30 common antidepressants based on data from over 58,500 patients across 151 studies. The research reveals substantial differences in physical effects such as weight gain, heart rate changes, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, showing that even within the widely prescribed SSRI class, drugs like fluoxetine have unique profiles. The findings emphasize that one-size-fits-all prescribing is inadequate, and that individual patient conditions—such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol—should guide medication selection. Personalized treatment recommendations are made for hypothetical patients like Sarah (weight gain concern), John (blood pressure concern), and Jane (cholesterol concern), with specific drugs like citalopram, escitalopram, or agomelatine being suggested. Experts caution that while short-term side effects are well-documented, long-term cumulative risks in chronic depression remain uncertain. The researchers are developing a free online tool to assist clinicians and patients in making informed choices, and they stress that shifting from a generic, cost-driven model to personalized prescribing could dramatically reduce the current 85% prescription rate of just three drugs.",
