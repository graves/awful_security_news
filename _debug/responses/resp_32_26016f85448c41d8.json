  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a Marine Corps 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a live-fire artillery demonstration involving an M777 Howitzer fired a 155mm shell over the I-5 interstate highway — a route not used for such operations in over 70 years. The first shell fired exploded prematurely, sending fragments that damaged a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle. Although no injuries were reported, the incident raised serious safety concerns, especially given that the same batch of shells had been successfully used earlier in the week. The event took place during a visit by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, highlighting the military’s tradition of staging high-profile demonstrations for VIPs. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the operation as dangerous and ordered the highway closure. The US has rapidly increased 155mm shell production since 2022 due to Ukraine’s war with Russia, sending over 3 million rounds to Ukraine. A 2024 Reuters investigation revealed past manufacturing flaws, including cracked shells and a shift to a less stable explosive, later reversed to TNT for production efficiency. Experts, including retired Marine Corps Colonel Mark Cancian, note that while the shells were fired high and theoretically safe, the premature detonation remains abnormal and raises questions about manufacturing integrity and safety protocols.",
