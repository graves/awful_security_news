  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year giant panda program after sending Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji back to China, marking a symbolic and political shift in U.S.-China relations. Initiated in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China, the program began as a gesture of diplomatic thaw and grew into a global initiative, with pandas loaned to zoos in the U.S., Russia, Qatar, and others. However, the program has declined due to worsening diplomatic tensions, public backlash over claims of panda abuse at Memphis Zoo, and a broader shift in China’s diplomatic priorities. With zoos in the U.S. and Scotland soon returning pandas to China, and only Xin Xin remaining in the Americas in Mexico City, the era of panda diplomacy appears to be ending. While the National Zoo remains hopeful about future returns, the program’s end reflects both the challenges of diplomatic engagement and the emotional legacy of these beloved animals.",
