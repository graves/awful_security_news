  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following Prince Andrew's removal from royal titles due to his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson has lost her Duchess of York title and reverted to her maiden name. The scandal, intensified by a 2011 email in which she referred to Epstein as her 'supreme friend,' has led to the withdrawal of her patronage from multiple charities and damaged her public reputation. While Sarah has shown resilience through continued royal attendance and personal ties, her business ventures and public roles are likely to suffer. In contrast, her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie retain their princess titles and are unaffected by the scandal, though they are considered low in the line of succession and unlikely to take on official royal duties. The article highlights how the scandal has most directly impacted Prince Andrew, whose loss of titles and status is deeply personal, while the daughters remain largely untarnished and are viewed as protected by the royal family's compassion and discretion.",
