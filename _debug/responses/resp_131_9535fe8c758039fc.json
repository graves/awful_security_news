  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like thunder, animal behavior, and unusual sounds—is being used to predict and prevent deadly glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite government investments in expensive early warning systems (EWS), such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, communities lack trust due to equipment failures, lack of community involvement, and poor follow-up. In several incidents, shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have successfully saved lives by using traditional alert methods, such as gunfire signals, demonstrating that human-based knowledge remains both accessible and effective. The article underscores Pakistan’s status as one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, with rising temperatures and reduced snowfall accelerating glacier melt. It concludes that while technology plays a role, true resilience depends on trust, community inclusion, and the integration of local wisdom into disaster response frameworks.",
