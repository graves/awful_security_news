  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party, which was founded by Evo Morales. The victory comes amid a severe economic crisis characterized by plummeting natural gas exports, high inflation, and fuel shortages, prompting widespread voter disillusionment with the MAS-led state-led economic model. Paz’s platform emphasizes gradual reform, private sector growth, and regional fiscal autonomy, while pledging to preserve social programs. His campaign was bolstered by the populist appeal of running mate Edman Lara, known for exposing corruption through TikTok. Though Paz’s party holds only a plurality in the legislature, he will need to form alliances to govern. Both candidates pledged stronger diplomatic ties with the United States, with Paz proposing a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal to secure fuel supplies. The incoming administration faces significant challenges, including securing fuel imports, managing economic transitions, and balancing fiscal reform with social stability—particularly due to threats from the main labor union, COB, which may oppose any cuts to social programs. This election signals a transformative moment in Bolivian democracy, with voters seeking economic change and a new political direction.",
