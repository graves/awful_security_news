  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. government is in a prolonged shutdown, entering its fourth week, with 2.4 million federal workers going unpaid and key programs like Head Start and WIC at risk of closure. President Donald Trump has refused to compromise on health care funding, rejecting Democratic demands for expanded subsidies, and insists that the government must reopen before any negotiations occur. Republicans blame Democrats for holding the government hostage, while Democrats argue the shutdown is causing real economic and health-related harm, particularly for low-income families. With health care subsidies set to expire on December 31, 2025, and enrollment for the Affordable Care Act beginning on November 1, the situation is growing more urgent. Economists warn of ongoing economic losses, with weekly reductions in GDP growth, while federal agencies including the NNSA and FAA face operational disruptions. The political standoff underscores a deeper divide between partisan ideologies and the practical consequences of inaction on public services and economic stability.",
