  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, when a technical failure in its Domain Name System (DNS) prevented users from accessing data stored in AWS services like DynamoDB and EC2. This disrupted major online services, including banking, social media, airline booking, and shopping platforms, affecting millions of users worldwide. Although AWS is generally reliable, the incident underscores the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure due to overreliance on a small number of cloud providers. Experts note that such outages are often caused by technical faults, such as faulty updates or configuration errors, rather than cyberattacks, and highlight the need for greater redundancy and distributed systems to improve resilience. The outage lasted several hours and was resolved by 6:35 AM ET, with AWS recommending cache clearing to restore services. This event echoes past crises, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, demonstrating a recurring pattern of systemic vulnerability in global digital infrastructure.",
