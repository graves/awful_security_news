    "Reefline is a 7-mile-long artificial reef off Miami Beach, combining art, science, and ecological restoration to revive a once-thriving coral reef.",
    "The project features marine-grade concrete sculptures, including 22 cast cars and 57 giant starfish, designed to serve as coral substrates and future habitats for marine life.",
    "Colin Foord, a coral researcher and founder of Coral Morphologic, is overseeing coral propagation in a nursery, with over 2,000 gorgonian soft corals being cultivated for transplanted growth.",
    "Artist Ximena Caminos, a cultural placemaker from Argentina, is the artistic director and leads the project’s vision as an ecotourism and cultural revival initiative.",
    "The Reefline project is partially funded by a $5 million Miami Beach city bond and seeks an additional $6 million in public and private fundraising for its first phase.",
    "The project aims to restore a historic coral reef ecosystem that was lost in the 1970s due to sand replenishment and environmental degradation.",
    "The artificial reef will be accessible to divers in shallow waters (15–20 feet deep), and some structures will be visible from the air, potentially becoming a symbolic landmark.",
    "Artists like Leandro Ehrlich believe the sculptures will be gradually covered by coral growth, transforming them into living, biologically active ecosystems over time."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef designed to restore a historic coral ecosystem lost in the 1970s. Led by arts curator Ximena Caminos and coral scientist Colin Foord, the project combines marine art and ecological science using concrete sculptures—such as 22 cast cars and 57 starfish—as coral substrates. These sculptures will slowly be colonized by resilient gorgonian corals grown in a nursery, transforming into vibrant, living reefs. The initiative, funded in part by a $5 million city bond and seeking $6 million more, is expected to take at least a decade to complete and will include an onshore marine learning center to educate the public. Reefline not only restores marine biodiversity but also creates a unique ecotourism destination visible from the air and accessible to divers, blending art, science, and environmental restoration into a sustainable cultural and ecological vision.",
