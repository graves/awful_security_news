  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has escalated drone attacks on Ukraine’s power, water, and heating infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, targeting facilities on multiple occasions over the past month. These attacks, which have included deadly strikes in Novhorod-Siverskyi and widespread blackouts, are seen as deliberate tactics to terrorize civilians and prolong suffering. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded by turning to European allies for urgent military and financial support, including proposals to use frozen Russian assets to fund Patriot air defense systems and long-range missiles. The European Union, under German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is exploring a $163 billion loan to Ukraine, while also facing criticism from Russia over the legality of asset seizure. Analysts note a recurring pattern: when U.S. President Donald Trump expresses frustration toward Russia, Moscow intensifies attacks, indicating a cycle of escalation. As Ukraine faces chronic shortfalls in air defense and military aid, Zelensky remains committed to peace, warning that any summit hosted by Russia’s ally Viktor Orban in Budapest could be politically risky and serve Russian interests rather than advance Ukrainian security.",
