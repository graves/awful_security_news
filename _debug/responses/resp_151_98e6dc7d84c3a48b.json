  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a recent Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine's Chernihiv region, at least four civilians were killed and 10 injured, with widespread power and water outages affecting hundreds of thousands. The attacks targeted energy facilities, with authorities accusing Russia of deliberately disrupting utilities to terrorize residents during winter. The town of Novhorod-Siverskyi was specifically hit, and residents resorted to makeshift solutions like cisterns and government-run 'invincibility points' to survive. Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, condemned Russia's tactics as both brutal and deceptive, emphasizing the ongoing threat of military aggression. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts involving U.S. President Donald Trump, who had proposed a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, were canceled due to lack of immediate plans and conflicting demands regarding territorial concessions. European leaders and the EU firmly oppose any territorial compromise, affirming that peace negotiations must preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. These events highlight the continued use of energy infrastructure as a military target and the broader geopolitical struggle between Ukraine and Russia, with international actors engaged in both military and diplomatic responses.",
