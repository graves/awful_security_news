  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US military conducted a strike in the Caribbean targeting an alleged drug boat, marking the first known operation that did not kill all on board. Two survivors were detained by the US Navy, making this the first instance of the Trump administration holding prisoners from such a strike. The operation is part of a broader campaign to reduce drug trafficking into the US and to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is accused of offering resource access in exchange for environmental concessions. The legality of the strikes is in question, as the administration relies on presidential authority under Article II rather than Congressional war authorization. Legal experts warn that the detention of the survivors raises constitutional and due process concerns, particularly under the habeas corpus framework. The US has deployed numerous military assets to the region, and the White House has not clarified the fate of the detainees, adding to the legal and political ambiguity surrounding the operation.",
