  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As artificial intelligence drives a surge in data center demand, companies and researchers are exploring space-based solutions to overcome terrestrial limitations such as land scarcity and high energy use. Projects like the European ASCEND initiative and startups such as Madari Space, Lonestar Data Holdings, and Starcloud are testing small-scale space computing payloads. These efforts aim to leverage continuous solar energy and reduce lag in data processing, especially for Earth observation satellites. However, major challenges remain—including heat dissipation in space, radiation exposure, high launch costs, and risks from space debris and solar flares. While proponents argue that space-based data centers are essential to avoid technological stagnation and resource exhaustion, experts like Quentin A. Parker caution that terrestrial solutions remain more practical and cost-effective. The sector is still in early development, with first launches planned for 2026 and 2027, and full-scale deployment expected within the next decade.",
