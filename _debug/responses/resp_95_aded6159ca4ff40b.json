  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The United States military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, deploying over 4,500 Marines and sailors, F-35 fighter jets, MQ-9 drones, and advanced naval assets such as destroyers and submarines. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico has been reopened as a strategic base, and multiple military flights—over 200 in total—have been conducted in the region, including intelligence-gathering and live-fire exercises. The buildup is widely interpreted as a pressure campaign aimed at weakening Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, not a plan for invasion. While the US has the capability to conduct strikes inside Venezuela using Tomahawk missiles, experts note that the force is not sufficient for occupation. The operation includes show of force actions like B-52 bomber flights near Venezuela’s coast and training missions off Trinidad and Tobago. The US faces challenges due to Venezuela’s air defenses, including S-300 systems and F-16s, and the ongoing hurricane season, which complicates military operations. The strategy is seen as primarily signaling and deterrence rather than direct combat.",
