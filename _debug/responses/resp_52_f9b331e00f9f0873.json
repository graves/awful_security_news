  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite Trump’s initial threat to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles—raising the possibility of escalation—his subsequent statement that the war could end without such escalation signals a shift toward ceasefire talks. The meeting marks a significant diplomatic improvement between Trump and Zelensky, though Kyiv’s ultimate goal of a lasting peace remains out of reach. Meanwhile, Russia’s military campaign has failed to make key territorial gains, with Ukraine holding critical cities like Pokrovsk, Kupiansk, and Kostyantynivka. Ukrainian drone warfare has proven effective, shifting battlefield dynamics. European allies are stepping in more, and Zelensky is now promoting Ukrainian drone technology to NATO members. Putin faces mounting domestic and economic pressure, and Russia’s global support is weakening due to sanctions and shifting alliances. The article suggests that while a ceasefire may be near, the war remains unresolved and vulnerable to future shifts due to winter conditions and military attrition.",
