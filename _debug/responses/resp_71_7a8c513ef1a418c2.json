  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In the second week of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Israel identifies the body of a 75-year-old man, Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit from Kibbutz Nir Oz, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza. Despite the agreement, frustration grows in Israel over the continued failure to return all missing bodies, with Israeli intelligence suspecting Hamas of withholding information about some deceased hostages. Hamas claims it has handed over all accessible remains, but al-Qassam Brigades requests special equipment for recovery. The ceasefire is strained by Israeli military strikes, including the killing of 11 civilians crossing the yellow line, and limited aid access due to only two open border crossings, including the still-closed Rafah crossing. Negotiations on Phase Two are underway in Egypt, focusing on Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force (ISF), with the Trump administration proposing a technocratic Palestinian government and a U.S.-led Board of Peace. However, Hamas remains vague on disarmament, and international participation in the ISF is still being negotiated with demands for UN approval.",
