  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence at La Santé Prison in Paris, marking the first time a former head of state in modern French history has been incarcerated. The sentence stems from a criminal conspiracy charge related to using Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors. Although Sarkozy has appealed the conviction and claims he is innocent, he remains in prison, housed in the prison’s VIP wing — a facility historically reserved for high-risk or politically sensitive figures such as former dictators, terrorists, and criminals. The case has drawn international attention due to its implications for political transparency, foreign influence in elections, and judicial accountability. The legal team has requested early release, pending a two-month review by the court. The article also highlights the conditions of the VIP wing, referencing past inmates like Manuel Noriega, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, and Jacques Mesrine, underscoring the gravity and historical resonance of the situation.",
