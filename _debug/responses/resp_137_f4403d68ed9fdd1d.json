  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Afghanistan and Pakistan escalated hostilities after a suicide bombing in Pakistan’s Mir Ali region, prompting Pakistan to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan’s Paktika province targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur militant group. The attacks killed dozens of militants and at least 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking condemnation from the Taliban, who accused Pakistan of violating Afghan sovereignty. The two nations convened in Doha for urgent talks, with regional powers like Qatar and Saudi Arabia calling for calm. The conflict, rooted in the contested Durand Line and growing militant activity, threatens regional stability and has led to social disruptions, such as the national cricket board’s boycott of a series in Pakistan. Diplomatic efforts aim to restore peace, while both countries emphasize the need for mutual security and the elimination of militant sanctuaries.",
