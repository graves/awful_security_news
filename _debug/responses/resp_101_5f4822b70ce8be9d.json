  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary, has stepped away from the Democratic Party and identifies as an independent, citing deep internal disunity, public expressions of doubt about President Joe Biden’s fitness, and a failure to protect marginalized communities like Black women. She describes her experience during the June 2024 presidential debate, where she observed Biden’s health and noted how political vulnerability was exploited. Jean-Pierre blames Democratic disunity—exemplified by public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney—on the party’s inability to rally around Biden. She also addresses criticism of her own leadership, attributing it to bias against Black women in political roles. Her book, 'Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,' serves as a critique of party dysfunction and a call for political reimagining. Jean-Pierre frames her independence not as a partisan defection, but as a stance of accountability and a demand for civic engagement in rebuilding a more inclusive and responsive political system.",
