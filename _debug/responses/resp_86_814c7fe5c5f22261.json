  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not appearing on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major political force in the 2025 gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli is leveraging Trump’s influence through rallies and messaging, while Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill attacks Trump’s policies—such as canceling the Gateway tunnel and imposing tariffs—to appeal to voters concerned about economic consequences. In Virginia, the race is less competitive and Trump’s role is more limited due to a government shutdown. The New Jersey race, especially in swing counties like Passaic County, reflects a significant shift in voter alignment, with Democrats warning of voter base erosion. The broader significance lies in how Trump’s second term is shaping local politics and whether voters will experience 'voters’ remorse,' potentially impacting future electoral outcomes and the 2026 midterm elections.",
