  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Boeing 747 cargo plane operated by ACT Airlines on behalf of Emirates landed at Hong Kong International Airport shortly before 4:00am on Monday, skidded off the north runway, crashed through a fence, and struck a patrol car, which was then swept into the sea. The incident resulted in the deaths of two airport security workers: a 30-year-old man at the scene and a 41-year-old man who died after being rushed to hospital. All four crew members were unharmed and treated for injuries. Authorities, including Steven Yiu of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, confirmed that runway and weather conditions were safe and that no emergency signal was sent. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the runway excursion, with Hong Kong police not ruling out a criminal investigation. Aviation experts, such as Tony Stanton, anticipate that crew interviews and flight data from the black box will be critical in understanding the incident.",
