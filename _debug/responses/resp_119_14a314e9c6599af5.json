  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins has formally objected to the use of his performance of 'Danger Zone' in a fake AI-generated video posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social. The video, depicting a crown-wearing Trump in a fighter jet with 'KING TRUMP' emblazoned, plays 'Danger Zone' as sludge is dumped over protesters in Times Square â€” a scene seemingly in response to the widespread 'No Kings' protests across the U.S. Loggins asserts that the use of his music is unauthorized and expresses concern that such politically charged content can deepen societal division. While the use of music in political videos is generally legal if rights are properly compensated, performers can prohibit specific uses, especially in campaign-related content. This incident follows a pattern of musicians, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, challenging Trump's political use of their music, with the Hayes case still ongoing. The White House declined to comment directly on Loggins' request, instead sharing a film still from 'Top Gun' with the caption 'I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED'.",
