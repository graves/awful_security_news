  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, China's defense ministry announced the expulsion of two top military officials, He Weidong and Miao Hua, from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army due to corruption charges. He Weidong, who served as the second-highest-ranking general and held a seat on the Politburo, is the first sitting general to be expelled from the Central Military Commission since the Cultural Revolution. Miao Hua, previously investigated and removed in June 2025, is also targeted. The purge is part of a broader anti-corruption drive initiated in 2023 and aligns with President Xi Jinping’s campaign to 'clean house' within the military and political leadership. The removals are particularly significant as they occur just before the Central Committee’s Fourth Plenum, where new appointments are expected. He Weidong’s close ties to Xi Jinping, including their service in Fujian province and his role in planning aggressive drills after Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022, underscore the strategic and political implications of the purge. The campaign extends to other senior officials, including former political commissars and joint command leaders, and reflects a deepening structural shift in China’s military and party governance.",
