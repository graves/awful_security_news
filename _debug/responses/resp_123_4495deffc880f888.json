  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Warner Bros. Discovery, just months after announcing plans to split into two companies — one focusing on streaming and studios (including HBO, HBO Max, DC Studios) and the other on cable and digital networks (including CNN, Discovery+, TNT Sports) — has initiated a review of strategic alternatives following unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This includes potential offers from Paramount (Skydance-owned), Netflix, and Comcast. Paramount reportedly made a majority-cash offer in late September, which was rebuffed by CEO David Zaslav, and later considered a more aggressive approach. The company’s review process has no set timeline, and while the split is still underway, the growing market interest suggests potential transaction possibilities. The announcement caused Warner Bros. Discovery’s shares to rise over 11%, reflecting market confidence in the company’s value amid competitive bidding dynamics.",
