  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study published in Pediatrics finds that reversing long-standing advice to avoid peanuts in infants has significantly reduced food allergy rates in the U.S. Over the past decade, the shift in guidance — inspired by the landmark LEAP study and endorsed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and included in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans — led to a 43% drop in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergy prevalence. The study analyzed data from over 120,000 children and estimates that the change in policy has prevented at least 40,000 cases of peanut allergy. Experts like Dr. David Hill and Dr. Corinne Keet highlight that early allergen introduction, especially for high-risk infants, reduces the risk of lifelong allergies, with only about 10% of affected children outgrowing their allergies. Despite the success, implementation remains uneven due to parental fear and lack of awareness, and limitations in data collection (such as reliance on diagnostic codes) are noted.",
