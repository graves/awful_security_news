  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop India’s purchases of Russian oil, a claim India firmly denies. India’s foreign ministry states it has no knowledge of any such discussion, and emphasizes its ongoing need for stable and diversified energy supplies, including significant imports from Russia. Data from trade intelligence firm Kpler shows that India’s state-owned refiner Indian Oil Corporation has maintained high volumes of Russian oil purchases, indicating that such a shift is not feasible due to volume, quality, and refinery constraints. The situation reflects deeper geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India, with India asserting its energy independence and strategic alignment with Russia. Diplomatic efforts are underway, but unresolved trade negotiations continue to strain bilateral relations.",
