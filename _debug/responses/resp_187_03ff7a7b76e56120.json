  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is undergoing a major renovation as parts of its East Wing—constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942—are being demolished to make way for a new $250 million ballroom. President Donald Trump has announced the project, asserting that it will be 'near' but not 'touching' the existing structure and will respect its historical integrity. The project is privately funded by unnamed 'Patriots' and will be designed by McCrery Architects with Clark Construction overseeing the work. However, critics—including the National Park Service, the Society of Architectural Historians, and the American Institute of Architects—have raised serious concerns over the lack of a formal, transparent review process, which is typically required for such a historically significant building. This development marks the first major exterior alteration to the East Wing since 1942 and raises broader questions about the balance between modernization and preservation in one of the world's most iconic political and cultural landmarks.",
