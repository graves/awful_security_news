  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted in Maryland on October 16, 2025, on 18 counts related to the transmission and retention of top-secret classified information. The charges stem from a 2021 FBI investigation triggered by an Iran hack of Bolton’s email accounts, which revealed that he shared over a thousand pages of handwritten diary entries—containing classified material—from his time in the White House. Allegedly, Bolton used personal email accounts (AOL, Google) to transmit this information to family members who had no security clearance. The case, now being overseen by Judge Theodore Chuang, is distinct from politically charged prosecutions like those of James Comey or Letitia James, as it has maintained support from career prosecutors. Bolton claims the charges are politically motivated, citing that no action was taken during the Biden administration despite prior scrutiny of his memoir. The indictment raises serious legal implications, potentially more severe than similar cases involving other officials, due to the active dissemination of top-secret material to non-clearance individuals.",
