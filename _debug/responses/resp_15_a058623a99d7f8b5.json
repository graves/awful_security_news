    "A basic portfolio of US and international stocks, plus investment-grade bonds, is sufficient for most investors seeking simplicity and broad exposure.",
    "For intermediate-term goals (5–10 years), intermediate-term bond funds or low-cost active funds may perform better than passive options in certain categories.",
    "Simplicity in investing improves clarity, reduces stress, and facilitates easier portfolio review, transfer, or handover to family members, especially in cases of cognitive decline.",
    "Even with strong returns, inadequate savings can prevent achieving financial goals—so simplicity helps ensure that saving behavior is prioritized and monitored."

Experts like Amy Arnott from Morningstar recommend simple, low-cost portfolios consisting of broad index funds, such as US and international stocks and investment-grade bonds, or target-date funds that adjust risk as retirement nears. The strategy reduces decision fatigue, improves clarity, and makes portfolios easier to manage or transfer to family members, especially in cases of cognitive decline. It also emphasizes that strong returns are insufficient without sufficient saving, making simplicity a practical and psychological benefit for everyday investors.",
