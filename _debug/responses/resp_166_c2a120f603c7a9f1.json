  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), led by the World Health Organization and including key partners like the Gates Foundation, is facing a severe funding crisis with a projected $1.7 billion shortfall through 2029, driven largely by reduced foreign aid from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This financial shortfall threatens critical polio eradication activities, particularly in high-risk regions such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, where 36 wild polio cases were reported in 2025. Meanwhile, 149 cases of vaccine-derived polio were recorded globally, including in Nigeria. In response, the GPEI plans to prioritize surveillance and vaccination in endemic areas, adopt fractional dosing to stretch vaccine supplies, and collaborate with other health programs like measles immunization. Despite declining polio cases since 2024, the situation underscores the urgent need for sustained global funding and political commitment to achieve a polio-free world.",
