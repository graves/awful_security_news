  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Oklahoma’s new public schools superintendent, Lindel Fields, rescinded a controversial mandate introduced by former Superintendent Ryan Walters that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and incorporated into student lesson plans for grades 5–12. The policy, which drew immediate backlash from civil rights groups and a pending lawsuit from parents, teachers, and religious leaders, was criticized as a violation of the separation of church and state. Fields emphasized that classroom religious instruction should be left to individual districts and that taxpayer money should not be spent on Bibles. He also stated that the department will review all of Walters’ education mandates, including a requirement for teacher applicants from California and New York to pass an ideology exam, potentially rescinding those as well. The decision signals a reversal of the far-right educational policies under Walters, which included promoting anti-woke ideology and conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election.",
