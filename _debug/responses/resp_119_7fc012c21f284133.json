  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Trump administration is making it harder for immigrants to become U.S. citizens by implementing a stricter naturalization test. Starting October 20, 2025, applicants will need to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly—doubling the previous requirement of 6 out of 10. The list of possible questions will grow from 100 to 128 and include more difficult, historically complex questions such as the reasons for U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf and Vietnam Wars. Easier questions on geography and basic facts are being removed. Applicants must now prove 'good moral character' through evidence of positive contributions to society and may face interviews with coworkers, neighbors, or family members. While USCIS officials argue the test ensures deeper assimilation and values alignment, critics like Professor Amanda Frost and advocacy group leaders such as Julie Mitchell say there is no evidence that the current process allows people who don't share American values to naturalize, and that the changes may disproportionately affect low-literacy individuals and those without access to preparation materials, possibly reducing naturalization rates and increasing uncertainty.",
