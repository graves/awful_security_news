  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major global outage on October 20, 2025, beginning around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and lasting through the day. The disruption stemmed from issues in AWS’s domain name system (DNS), which is essential for translating web addresses into IP addresses. As a result, numerous online services—including social media platforms like Snapchat and Roblox, financial apps like Robinhood, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, and educational platforms like Canvas—became inaccessible. Students at universities including the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, University of California, Riverside, and Ohio State University were unable to access coursework or submit assignments. Amazon confirmed that services were restored by 6 p.m. Eastern time, though engineers reported intermittent issues during recovery. Cybersecurity experts, including Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess, noted that such outages are common and typically resolve within hours, with no evidence of a cyberattack. This incident underscores the growing fragility of the internet, which increasingly depends on a small number of technology companies like Amazon to maintain core infrastructure.",
