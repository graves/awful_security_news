  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "At least 37 people have died in Mexico due to severe flooding caused by heavy rainfall from tropical storms, primarily affecting central and southeastern states such as Hidalgo, Veracruz, Queretaro, and Puebla. The disaster was exacerbated by landslides, road collapses, and power outages affecting over 320,000 households. Emergency responses included the deployment of more than 8,700 military personnel and 3,300 naval personnel, along with 18 vessels, helicopters, and food supplies. Tropical Storm Raymond, along with prior storms Priscilla and Octave, contributed to the extreme rainfall, and climate experts note the influence of a returning La Niña pattern, which may have intensified rainfall. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range was a key disaster zone, with isolated communities cut off. This event underscores the growing threat of climate-related disasters in Mexico due to increasing rainfall and extreme weather patterns in 2025.",
