  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, has challenged a proposed FDA labeling change that would warn about a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children. Despite claims by former President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that Tylenol increases neurodevelopmental risks, scientific evidence—including a large 2024 study of over 2 million children and expert reviews—shows no clear causal link. The FDA maintains that no clear evidence exists of harm from appropriate acetaminophen use, and regulatory bodies in the EU, UK, and Canada confirm its safety. Kenvue argues that the proposed label changes are unsupported by science and would mislead the public. The controversy highlights tensions between political messaging and medical evidence in public health policy.",
