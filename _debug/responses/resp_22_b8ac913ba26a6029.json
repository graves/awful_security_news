    "Sombr, a 20-year-old singer under the stage name Shane Boose, gained popularity through viral TikTok singles like 'Back to Friends' and 'Undressed'.",
    "A fan named Meg, 25 years old, posted a scathing review of Sombr's concert at The Anthem in Washington, DC, describing it as one of the worst experiences of her life due to an overwhelmingly young audience and immature humor.",
    "Meg criticized Sombr for making jokes about niche memes, including a 6-7 joke, and conducting a 'dating show' sketch where he solicited young attendees to call their 'toxic exes', which she deemed inappropriate and cringe.",
    "Sombr responded to Meg’s post with a TikTok video where he called the situation 'TikTok drama' and defended his content, stating he is a 20-year-old artist and that audiences include younger people, which he sees as normal and part of his lifestyle.",
    "Sombr emphasized that he makes jokes only for 5 minutes of the concert and the rest is music, and he claims his humor is lighthearted and not serious.",
    "He further used a 'touch grass' social media gesture to mock the idea of serious audience expectations, signaling a playful and ironic tone.",
    "Meg responded that despite her political content typically causing division, this review received more hate than any previous post, suggesting heightened public sensitivity to online criticism of artists.",
    "The incident reflects broader tensions in social media culture over artistic expression, audience expectations, and the boundaries of humor in live performances."
