  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the plan. The NZF, which would have imposed a $380-per-ton carbon tax on shipping emissions, had already been approved in April 2025. Trump’s public criticism of the framework as a 'global green new scam tax' and his call for countries to vote against it led to a shift in voting dynamics, with several countries—such as Argentina and Singapore—changing their positions. Despite strong support from China, the EU, and others, opposition from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and shifting votes from previously supportive nations resulted in a narrow vote to postpone the decision. The delay undermines global efforts to reduce maritime emissions, which contribute significantly to climate change, and raises concerns about industry investment, seafarer safety, and oceanic stability. Experts and climate leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, have condemned the outcome as a missed opportunity for climate action.",
