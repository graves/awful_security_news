  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine coast, over 9,000 residents of Catanduanes have evacuated due to predicted coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters high and strong winds. The storm, with gusts reaching 80km/h, is expected to pass near the impoverished island, which has historically been the first landmass hit by Pacific cyclones. This event occurs amid a broader disaster context, including recent deadly earthquakes in Cebu and the southern Philippines, and Typhoon Ragasa in September. The Philippine government has activated evacuation plans for high-risk zones, reflecting ongoing disaster preparedness. Scientists emphasize that increasing storm intensity is linked to climate change, highlighting the global relevance of this event in understanding the impact of environmental change on vulnerable populations.",
