  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, demanded accountability from federal immigration officials for allegedly violating her order to restrict the use of tear gas and less-lethal force during protests in Chicago. The Trump administration, through CBP and ICE, defended its actions, with officials denying reports of tear gas deployment without warning, though acknowledging they had not personally observed such incidents. Judge Ellis expressed strong concern that her order—requiring body-worn cameras and limiting force use—was not being followed, prompting a court hearing where officials like Kyle Harvick and Shawn Byers testified. The hearing was prompted by Operation Midway Blitz, a major ICE enforcement campaign from September 8 to October 3 that led to over 1,000 arrests. Protests continued at the Broadview ICE facility, resulting in multiple arrests. Judge Ellis has ordered that Russell Hott and Gregory Bovino be deposed at a later date to provide full context on events, underscoring her commitment to transparency and accountability in law enforcement actions during public demonstrations.",
