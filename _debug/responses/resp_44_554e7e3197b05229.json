  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A coalition of seven leading U.S. universities — including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, MIT, and Brown University — has rejected a proposed compact from the Trump administration offering expanded federal funding in exchange for significant ideological reforms. The compact demands changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, defining gender based on biological processes, and enforcing policies on grade integrity and faculty engagement. Universities argue that these conditions threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House claims the proposal supports a ‘vibrant marketplace of ideas’ and offers preferential access to grants and events, while critics say it represents an overreach of federal control into academic governance. Other schools, including Vanderbilt and the University of Texas at Austin, remain either non-committal or in dialogue. The situation underscores a broader political and cultural struggle over the role of government in higher education, with institutions asserting their independence amid growing federal influence.",
