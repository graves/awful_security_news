  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A single vote in the Terrebonne electoral district of Quebec, Canada, was not counted due to an administrative error—specifically, an incorrect postal code printed on ballots by Elections Canada staff—leading to a legal challenge by incumbent Bloc Québécois candidate Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné. The vote was initially projected to be won by a narrow margin, and after a recount, the seat was decided by just one vote in favor of Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste. Emmanuelle Bossé, a Terrebonne resident, claimed her mail-in ballot was returned due to the postal code error, asserting that it could have altered the result. Now, in a three-day hearing at Quebec’s Superior Court, both parties argue over whether the election result should be upheld or overturned. The case highlights the fragility of close elections and raises broader concerns about public trust in electoral systems, despite Elections Canada’s assertion that such errors are inevitable in a complex process.",
