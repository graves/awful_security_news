  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have united behind a call for a ceasefire at the current front line in Ukraine, echoing US President Donald Trump’s proposal to halt fighting and establish negotiations from the existing battle line. While Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly opposes any territorial concessions in the Donbas regions, citing security risks, Russia through Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov rejects the idea of a front-line freeze, insisting instead on long-term peace that includes full Russian withdrawal and recognition of Russian sovereignty over Donbas. Despite Trump’s earlier suggestions of territorial concessions, he has since revised his stance, advocating a ceasefire along the current line. A potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest faces significant logistical and political challenges, including international arrest warrants and regional opposition in Poland and Lithuania, with Bulgaria offering a possible alternative route. Diplomatic efforts remain stalled, highlighting the deep intractability of the conflict and the difficulty of achieving a lasting peace.",
