  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT on October 20, 2025, in its Virginia data center, was caused by a technical error during a software update to DynamoDB’s API, which led to a DNS failure and prevented apps from finding server addresses. This cascading failure affected 113 AWS services, disrupting major platforms including Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Roblox, Fortnite, banks like Venmo and Coinbase, and media companies such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The incident revealed how deeply reliant modern digital services—ranging from finance and communication to gaming and smart home devices—are on cloud infrastructure. Experts confirmed the failure stemmed from human error, not a cyberattack, and noted that despite the widespread impact, AWS’s market dominance and deep integration into services ensure minimal user migration. AWS declared recovery complete by 10:11 GMT, though some systems experienced delays in processing, and user reports continued to surface via platforms like Downdetector.",
