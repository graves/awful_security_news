    "The Trump administration proposed a federal funding compact for nine universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, USC, Brown, Dartmouth, and University of Texas at Austin, in exchange for policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international enrollment at 15%, and adopting gender definitions based on biological processes.",
