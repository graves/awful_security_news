  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas in Pará. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from deforested land to be laundered through transit permits (GTAs) that only record group-level data, not individual origins. This lack of traceability means JBS cannot verify that its beef or leather products are not linked to illegal deforestation. The state of Pará has seen a 421% increase in deforestation in 2024, with illegal ranchers encroaching on protected areas like Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa, where Indigenous and traditional communities face violence and displacement. Although Brazil has introduced traceability plans in both Pará (by 2026) and at the federal level (by 2032), advocacy groups argue that these timelines are too slow and that stronger, mandatory, government-led systems—especially with public access to GTA data—are needed to ensure accountability and halt deforestation.",
