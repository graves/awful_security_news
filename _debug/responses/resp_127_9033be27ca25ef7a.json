The browser integrates AI chatbot features such as 'agent mode,' which searches on behalf of users using browsing history and intent. This launch comes as OpenAI seeks to generate revenue from digital advertising, given its current unprofitable state. Despite its ambitious vision, OpenAI faces a significant challenge due to Chrome’s massive market share and AI advancements like Google's Gemini. Analysts warn that AI-driven browsing may reduce user agency, raise privacy concerns, and lead to misinformation, especially given findings from the European Broadcasting Union showing nearly half of AI responses are flawed. Public adoption of AI for information-seeking is high, with 60% of Americans and 74% of those under 30 using AI to find information. Meanwhile, legal disputes over copyright infringement, such as those involving The New York Times and The Associated Press, underscore the broader societal and ethical implications of AI-generated content.",
