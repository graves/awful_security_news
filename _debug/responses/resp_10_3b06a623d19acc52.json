The White House and U.S. officials believe Lavrov is not a key decision-maker and is loyal only to Putin, making high-level diplomatic talks with him ineffective. Despite this, a possible alternative meeting between Rubio and Lavrov is being explored at a future ASEAN-led global summit in Malaysia. The Kremlin maintains that no date has been set for the summit and thus it cannot be postponed. Trump has reiterated his call for an immediate end to the war, advocating for a 'battle line' solution, while past summits, such as the one in Anchorage, have failed to produce binding agreements, highlighting the ongoing challenges in achieving peace.",
