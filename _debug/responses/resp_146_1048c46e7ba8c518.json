  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping. The NZF, which would have charged ships $380 per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, was previously approved in April but now faces delays due to political pressure. Major supporters include China, the EU, and the UK, while Russia and Saudi Arabia oppose the plan. Argentina and Singapore, previously supportive, shifted to postponement. The decision has been criticized by climate advocates, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping, as undermining global efforts to decarbonize shipping and address climate change impacts like altered ocean currents and more frequent storms. The delay signals a significant setback in global climate action, particularly as shipping contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions.",
