  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States in a strong diplomatic response to threats from President Donald Trump, who accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut off aid and conduct military operations in Colombian waters. The US claimed to have struck a Colombian vessel, alleging drug transport by a left-wing rebel, without providing evidence. Colombian officials, including Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, described these actions as a threat of invasion and a violation of sovereignty, particularly after the death of fisherman Alejandro Carranza, whom Petro said had no ties to drug trafficking. The incident reflects a broader crisis over US military actions, sovereignty, and the legality of such operations in international waters.",
