  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Grammy-winning country music songwriter Brett James, 57, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, when his Cirrus SR22T aircraft entered a tightening spiral and crashed into a field in Franklin, North Carolina. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that James had requested a visual approach to runway 7, which was approved, but failed to tune to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) despite being instructed to do so. This communication failure led to a loss of contact, and the plane continued descending and executing a left turn before spiraling and crashing. No mechanical issues were found in the aircraft. James was a highly influential songwriter, known for his work with major artists including Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, and for co-writing 'Jesus, Take the Wheel,' which helped launch Carrie Underwood’s career.",
