  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports that the U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to a lack of passage of 12 appropriations bills, marking a continuation of political gridlock. It contrasts this with the 2018 shutdown, which was the longest in nearly 50 years, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. During that event, 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and 300,000 exempted from pay. The article attributes the current stalemate to deepening political polarization, a narrow House majority under Speaker Mike Johnson, and the inability to overcome a Senate filibuster. It also notes that while government shutdowns have become less frequent since 1981, increasing partisanship has made resolution difficult. The article emphasizes the economic and human cost of such events and highlights ongoing federal service disruptions as a result of legislative inaction.",
