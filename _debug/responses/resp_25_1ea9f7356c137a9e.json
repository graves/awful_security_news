  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a landmark decision, Judge Michael Jesic resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time since their conviction. The brothers, who have maintained claims of self-defense due to years of abuse by their father, took full responsibility in court and testified about remorse and rehabilitation. Family members and prison staff provided testimony supporting their transformation, including programs they founded in prison. However, current Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes the resentencing, citing fabricated abuse claims and a moderate risk of recidivism. The state parole board will hold a hearing on June 13, 2025, and the final decision will rest with Governor Gavin Newsom, who has the authority to grant or deny parole and commute sentences. The brothers are also pursuing a habeas corpus petition to reopen the case with new evidence, including a 1988 letter from Erik referencing abuse. This case reflects a broader societal reevaluation of punishment, rehabilitation, and trauma-based self-defense in criminal justice.",
