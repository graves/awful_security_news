  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly supporting illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa sustainable development area. The report highlights a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: the company does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing illegally deforested cattle to be moved through a 'laundering' system that conceals their origins. This occurs despite Brazil’s animal transit permit (GTA) system lacking individual animal tracking and despite JBS acknowledging in a 2024 SEC filing that it cannot guarantee compliance with environmental laws. The northern state of Pará, which has seen a 421% increase in deforestation in 2024, is central to the crisis, with illegal ranching and violent land invasions displacing Indigenous and traditional communities. While Brazil has introduced traceability measures in Pará (2023) and at the federal level (2024), experts argue these timelines are too slow and enforcement is weak. Environmental advocates emphasize that companies like JBS must be held accountable, and that stronger, mandatory traceability systems—potentially with publicly accessible data—are urgently needed to stop deforestation and protect human rights.",
