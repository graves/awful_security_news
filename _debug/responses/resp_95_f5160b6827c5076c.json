The film resonated with India’s post-liberalization cultural shift, capturing the nation's aspirations and anxieties about globalization and tradition. DDLJ became a cultural touchstone, launching the iconic on-screen pairing of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol and influencing a generation of romantic films. The film’s success is attributed to its emotional authenticity, cultural relevance, and innovative narrative that centered diaspora identity and intercultural conflict. Despite critiques of outdated gender dynamics, such as Simran’s lack of personal ambition and gaslighting, the film continues to draw audiences, especially in Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir theater, where daily screenings have persisted for nearly three decades. The article also highlights the film’s global appeal, particularly among South Asian diaspora communities, and its lasting impact on Indian cinema’s narrative framework.",
