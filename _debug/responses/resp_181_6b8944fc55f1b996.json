  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a landmark legal case brought by parents and school districts in Los Angeles County, social media giants Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube are being sued over alleged harms to young users' mental health due to addictive design features like notifications and likes. The companies argue they are shielded by 1990s federal law, but Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled that they remain liable for negligence in product design. The court has ordered CEO-level testimony from Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, and Adam Mosseri, emphasizing that executives’ firsthand knowledge is essential to assessing whether the companies failed to act on known risks. This trial is among the first to directly confront claims that social media platforms knowingly designed addictive experiences, leading to long-term mental health consequences for youth. The case reflects growing public and legal scrutiny on how social media companies manage user safety and parental controls.",
