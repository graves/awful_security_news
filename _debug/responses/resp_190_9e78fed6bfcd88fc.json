  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of the war, Russia launched intense drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, killing at least seven people including two children, with a kindergarten in Kharkiv and multiple areas in Kyiv severely damaged. The attacks occurred hours after US President Donald Trump shelved plans for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky linked to the failure to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles. Zelensky argued that without these weapons, Russia lost diplomatic interest, leading to increased aggression. Meanwhile, Russia rejected ceasefire calls and denied the summit was canceled, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserting that preparations continue and the summit remains a mutual goal. Ukraine responded with a successful strike on a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk using UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, indicating a shift toward direct retaliation. The attacks caused widespread power outages and civilian suffering, underscoring the deteriorating situation and the growing risk of further escalation in the conflict.",
