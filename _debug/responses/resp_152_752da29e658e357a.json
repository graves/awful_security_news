This financial crisis threatens essential activities such as vaccination and surveillance, especially in high-risk regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where wild polio cases remain. To adapt, the GPEI plans to prioritize operations in endemic areas, implement fractional dosing to conserve vaccine supplies, and strengthen collaboration with other health programs. Although wild and vaccine-derived polio cases have declined since 2024, the lack of sustained funding raises serious concerns about the long-term feasibility of achieving global eradication, emphasizing the need for renewed international commitment and investment in global health security.",
