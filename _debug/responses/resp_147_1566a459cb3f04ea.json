  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting. The WMO highlights that over 2 million people have died from weather-related disasters in the past 50 years, with 90% of these deaths in developing nations. Despite progress in early warning adoption—rising from 52 to 108 countries—the assessment reveals that 50% of surveyed countries have only basic capacity, and 16% have less than basic. The article emphasizes real-world examples, such as the evacuation of Switzerland’s Blatten village due to a glacier collapse in May 2025, and widespread disasters in Pakistan, Nigeria, South Korea, southern Europe, and the United States in 2025. The WMO stresses that early warnings enable early action and is vital to saving lives, protecting infrastructure, and addressing the spiraling impact of climate change.",
