  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the hidden human cost of Guatemala’s garment industry, where tens of thousands of women work in maquila factories producing clothing for major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren. Despite the sector’s economic importance—accounting for nearly 10% of Guatemala’s GDP—the workers face brutal conditions: low wages (less than $500/month), daily quotas of thousands of garments, standing for up to 15 hours, and unsafe environments with dirty water and cockroaches. Korean-owned companies dominate investments and control supply chains, shielding US brands from direct responsibility. Workers report widespread sexual harassment, threats, and violence, including the murder of union leader Anastacio Tzib Caal. Labor unions are few and often suppressed, with management blocking inspections and retaliating against activists. Despite efforts by Guatemalan authorities and new progressive leadership under President Bernardo Arévalo, systemic abuse persists due to a lack of political will and enforcement. The article concludes with a call for greater transparency, accountability, and protection for workers—especially women—whose labor underpins global fashion markets.",
