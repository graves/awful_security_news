  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mexico is facing a severe humanitarian crisis after at least 37 people died in flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall from tropical storms, including Raymond, Priscilla, and Octave. The worst-hit states are Hidalgo, Puebla, Veracruz, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosí, with Hidalgo reporting 22 fatalities and over 1,000 homes damaged, while Puebla affected more than 80,000 people. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range was particularly vulnerable due to its topography. The Mexican government responded with over 8,700 military personnel and extensive naval deployments, including 3,300 personnel and emergency supplies. Climate factors, such as the return of La Nina, are believed to have contributed to the extreme rainfall, which has persisted throughout 2025. Tropical Storm Raymond is expected to landfall in southern Baja California and weaken by Sunday. Authorities are focused on restoring power, reopening roads, and providing shelter to displaced populations.",
