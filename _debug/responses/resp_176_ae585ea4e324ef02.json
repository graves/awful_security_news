  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has announced the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing to build a new $250 million ballroom, asserting it will be 'near' but not 'touching' the existing structure. The project, privately funded by unnamed 'Patriots', is being managed by Clark Construction and designed by McCrery Architects. Despite Trump's claim of respecting the historic building, experts from the National Park Service, Society of Architectural Historians, and American Institute of Architects have raised serious concerns over the lack of a rigorous, transparent review process, citing the building's historical significance and the fact that this marks the first major exterior change in over 80 years. Critics argue that the project reflects Trump’s personal style rather than long-term preservation standards, with the new ballroom expected to host up to 900 people and feature lavish gold decor. This development has reignited public debate about the role of presidential authority in altering one of the world’s most iconic historical buildings.",
