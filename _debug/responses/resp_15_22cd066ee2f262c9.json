  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, China expelled two top military leaders—He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking general and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Miao Hua, the former top political officer of the navy—on corruption charges, marking the first such removal of a sitting general from the Central Military Commission since the Cultural Revolution. Both officials had been under investigation for serious violations of discipline and duty-related crimes involving large sums of money. He Weidong, a close ally of President Xi Jinping with deep roots in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, was also a member of the Politburo, elevating the political significance of his removal. His role in planning aggressive military drills around Taiwan after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit in 2022 further underscores the strategic implications. The purge is part of a broader anti-corruption campaign launched in 2023, with several other senior military officials also removed. These actions are expected to be formalized at the upcoming Central Committee’s Fourth Plenum, where new appointments to the Central Military Commission will be made, signaling President Xi’s ongoing efforts to consolidate power and ensure military loyalty.",
