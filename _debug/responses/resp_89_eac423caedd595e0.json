  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A working lunch between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia as a condition for ending the war. Trump, who previously suggested Ukraine could regain all lost territory, now advocated for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the war’s devastation and the realities of ongoing combat. This stance was influenced by a prior call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed a land swap involving the Donbas region in exchange for Russian-held southern Ukrainian areas. Trump rejected the idea of major territorial loss, stating that war should end at existing battle lines and downplaying any demand for Ukraine to surrender Donbas. While Ukrainian officials described the meeting as constructive, Zelensky expressed pessimism about Trump’s position. The meeting reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to the Ukraine war, now prioritizing rapid conflict resolution, mirroring his efforts to broker a peace deal in Gaza.",
