  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy entered La Santé prison in Paris on October 21, 2025, to begin serving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 presidential campaign with funds from Libya under Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. This marks the first time a former French head of state has been imprisoned, sparking widespread public debate and support. Sarkozy claims he is innocent and accuses political actors linked to Libya of orchestrating a scandal. He is being held in solitary confinement, with limited access to others, and has requested immediate release on appeal. Public figures including President Emmanuel Macron and France’s top magistrate Rémy Heitz have weighed in, with Heitz warning against political interference in the judicial process. Supporters have rallied in Paris, expressing outrage over what they perceive as an unjust outcome, while Sarkozy vows to fight the case and write a book about his experience.
