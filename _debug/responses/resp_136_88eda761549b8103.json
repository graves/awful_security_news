  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A U.S. military strike on a submersible vessel in the Caribbean, allegedly carrying drugs, resulted in multiple deaths and injuries. The Ecuadorian survivor, Andrés Fernando Tufiño, was released by Ecuadorian authorities after prosecutors found no evidence of criminal activity in the country. A Colombian citizen also survived the attack and is under investigation for drug trafficking. The Trump administration justified the attacks as part of an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels, citing fentanyl trafficking, though there is little evidence that fentanyl is produced in the Andes. The incidents have intensified diplomatic tensions, particularly between the U.S. and Colombia, where President Gustavo Petro criticized the U.S. for killing a citizen, leading to Colombia recalling its ambassador. Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa expressed solidarity with global anti-drug efforts while condemning the strikes as damaging to international peace. At least 32 people have died across six attacks since September 2025, with a seventh reported in early October 2025, signaling a growing pattern of military escalation in the region.",
