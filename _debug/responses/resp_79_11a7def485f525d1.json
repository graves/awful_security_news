    "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on October 16, 2025, on eight counts of transmitting and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
    "The indictment alleges that Bolton created and shared over 1,000 pages of diary-like notes containing classified information at the TOP SECRET level, which he allegedly transmitted via personal email accounts (AOL and Google) to family members.",
    "The case originated from an Iran hack of Bolton’s emails in 2021, prompting a federal investigation under the Biden administration, which was not initiated by the Trump DOJ.",
    "Bolton claims he is a victim of political targeting by the Trump Justice Department and argues that the charges are part of a broader effort to intimidate political opponents and suppress dissent.",
    "The case is being handled by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed by Barack Obama in 2014, and has maintained support from career prosecutors despite political controversy.",
    "Bolton’s prior media commentary, including criticism of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, is cited in the indictment as evidence of his awareness of classified information protocols.",
    "If proven, the charges are considered among the most serious in recent history due to the active dissemination of top-secret material to individuals without security clearance.",
    "President Donald Trump did not comment on the indictment in a way that directly addresses the charges, but he stated during a press event that 'he’s a bad person' and 'that’s the way it goes,' suggesting a political reaction to the indictment."
