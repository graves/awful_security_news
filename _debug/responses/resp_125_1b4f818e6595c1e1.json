  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from Bolivia, won the presidential election with 54% of the vote, defeating former president Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga, who received 45%. The victory marks a decisive break from 20 years of MAS-led governance, as Paz's campaign gained traction among working-class and Indigenous Aymara voters disillusioned with economic mismanagement. His running mate, former police officer Edman Lara, brought a populist, anti-corruption appeal, resonating with many voters despite causing internal tensions. Paz plans to end Bolivia’s fixed exchange rate, phase out fuel subsidies, and reduce public investment, while maintaining social benefits and adopting a gradual, market-oriented reform strategy to avoid triggering a recession or inflation spike. However, his policies face criticism for being vague and potentially unsustainable, especially amid a severe economic crisis marked by a U.S. dollar shortage, 23% inflation, and fuel shortages. The election reflects a deep political realignment and a shift toward market reforms, though the path ahead remains uncertain and challenging.",
