The messages, which include claims that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should be destroyed and references to a 'Nazi streak,' have sparked widespread criticism. Senators such as Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, Bernie Moreno, and James Lankford have signaled opposition or expressed reservations about the nomination, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune declaring that Ingrassia 'is not going to pass.' Ingrassia’s legal team has denied the authenticity of the texts, asserting they are satirical or manipulated, and highlighted his support among the Jewish community. Despite the White House’s initial support, the nomination appears doomed without bipartisan backing, raising concerns about the integrity of a key federal oversight body.",
