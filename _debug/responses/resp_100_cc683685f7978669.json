    "The internet platform model has undergone a devolution known as 'enshittification,' where platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade user and business experiences over time.",
    "This process occurs in three stages: Stage 1 (growth and user acquisition), Stage 2 (prioritizing business customers at user expense), and Stage 3 (profit maximization at the cost of user and merchant value).",
    "Doctorow attributes the degradation to a lack of competition and weak consumer protection regulations, allowing platforms to exploit network effects and high switching costs.",
    "Platforms increasingly charge junk fees, manipulate algorithms, and use data to push ads and boosted content, worsening search quality and consumer experience.",
    "Amazon and Facebook dispute the claims, asserting they have improved value and that practices like product cloning or junk fees are either inaccurate or optional.",
    "Solutions proposed include stronger antitrust enforcement, ending the 'consumer welfare standard,' enabling 'right-to-exit' policies, and enforcing interoperability between platforms.",
    "The enshittification theory has gained traction not just among left-leaning advocates but also among conservatives and international policy groups concerned about tech monopolies."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses Cory Doctorow’s theory of 'enshittification,' a process by which internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber degrade user and business experiences over time. Doctorow outlines three stages: initial user acquisition, business-focused expansion, and profit-driven deterioration where platforms exploit data, manipulate algorithms, and charge high fees. He attributes this decline to a lack of competition and weak regulation, arguing that platforms can operate without consequences due to network effects and switching costs. The article presents both Doctorow’s claims and counterarguments from Amazon and Facebook, highlighting the ongoing debate around platform accountability. The article concludes by proposing policy solutions such as stronger antitrust enforcement, interoperability, and a 'right-to-exit' policy to reverse this trend.",
