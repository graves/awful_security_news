  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A US jury has ruled that French bank BNP Paribas is complicit in Sudan’s atrocities by enabling the regime of former leader Omar al-Bashir through financial services such as letters of credit that facilitated export revenues. The plaintiffs—two men and one woman, now American citizens—claimed they suffered severe torture, burning, and sexual assault under the regime and that BNP Paribas’s services were a 'natural and adequate cause' of the harm. The verdict follows a five-week trial, with the jury rejecting the defense’s claim of no link between the bank’s operations and the violence. BNP Paribas previously paid $8.97 billion in penalties for sanctions violations, and the US recognized the conflict as genocide in 2004. The case underscores growing global pressure on financial institutions to hold themselves accountable for enabling human rights abuses, especially in authoritarian regimes. Despite defense arguments that the bank had no knowledge of abuses and that Sudan committed crimes independently, the jury concluded that the bank’s financial support directly sustained the regime responsible for ethnic cleansing. The broader context includes the 2019 ousting of al-Bashir, ongoing political instability, and renewed violence between military factions and the RSF, indicating that the legacy of past atrocities continues to impact Sudan’s future.",
