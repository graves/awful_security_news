  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details a renewed escalation in US-China trade tensions, triggered by Donald Trump's threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China's retaliatory export controls on rare earth minerals. These actions—part of a long-standing rivalry—reflect a strategic shift where both nations use economic and technological tools to assert national security interests. The conflict is rooted in historical trade disputes, including tariffs imposed by Trump and retaliatory measures by China, and recent actions such as export controls on semiconductors and rare earths. Experts suggest that China’s measures are strategic 'pre-meeting choreography' to gain leverage during the upcoming Trump-Xi summit in South Korea. While the US maintains greater economic power, China is seen as more organized and prepared. Both sides are likely to keep escalation tools in reserve, with the outcome depending more on market reactions than diplomatic negotiations. The situation threatens global trade stability and underscores the deepening of great power competition in economic and technological spheres.",
