    "Netanyahu insists that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized, but Israeli commentators now believe that U.S. policy is increasingly shaping military decisions.",
    "The yellow line may eventually become a de facto border if the second stage of negotiations fails, enabling new settler expansion and potentially leading to the annexation of Gaza by Israel.",
    "While most Israelis support ending the war and bringing home hostages and soldiers, Netanyahu's strategy of keeping options open reflects his political calculation between domestic and international pressures."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The yellow line, a temporary military boundary in Gaza established under Donald Trump's peace plan, marks Israel's first stage of withdrawal, leaving it in control of about 53% of the territory. While Israeli far-right allies see it as a potential de facto border enabling settlement expansion, U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to maintain ceasefire and avoid escalation. Netanyahu faces a difficult balancing act between domestic far-right demands for war and U.S. pressure to keep peace talks alive, especially as Hamas continues to violate ceasefire terms. The article highlights how the yellow line is not just a geographic boundary but a political symbol—reflecting tensions between domestic political coalitions and international diplomatic influence, and raising questions about whether the second stage of negotiations will succeed or if the yellow line will become permanent.",
