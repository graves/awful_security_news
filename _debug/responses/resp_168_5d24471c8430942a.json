  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "AI-generated voice cloning has reached a level of sophistication where deepfake voices are indistinguishable from real human voices, as demonstrated by a recent scam targeting wealthy Italian businessmen who were contacted by fake calls from Defence Minister Guido Crosetto. The fraud, which occurred in early 2025, involved AI-generated voice clones that requested large financial transfers, with only former Inter Milan owner Massimo Moratti sending money. Research from Queen Mary University of London found that 41% of AI-generated voices and 58% of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices, and participants rated AI voices as more trustworthy than real ones. This rise in AI voice scams, which has led to over $547 million in global losses between January and June 2025, raises serious concerns about identity theft, financial fraud, and the spread of misinformation. AI-generated deepfakes are also being used to produce harmful content, including child sexual abuse material, prompting governments like the US and Australia to introduce legal bans on such technology.",
