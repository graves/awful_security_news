The attacks targeted key energy facilities, and local officials accused Russia of deliberately disrupting utilities to terrorize civilians during the winter. The Russian government denied plans for a Trump-Putin summit, despite earlier speculation, and Ukraine’s leaders, including President Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Sybiha, condemned Russian aggression and refused to accept territorial concessions. The incident underscores a persistent pattern of Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, while also highlighting growing international diplomatic tensions, especially regarding potential military escalation and peace negotiations.",
