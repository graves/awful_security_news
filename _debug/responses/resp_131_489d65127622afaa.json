  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A wave of anti-science legislation has emerged in U.S. statehouses in 2025, with over 420 bills targeting public health protections including vaccines, fluoridation, and milk safety. These bills are largely driven by a politically organized network connected to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda, supported by four national groups: MAHA Action, Stand for Health Freedom, the National Vaccine Information Center, and the Weston A. Price Foundation. While these groups claim their positions are science-based and rooted in personal liberty, experts argue they promote misinformation and undermine public health. Over 70 bills directly target fluoride, and at least 26 anti-vaccine laws have been enacted. The movement has financial incentives, with advocates and sellers of raw milk profiting from the legislation. Falling vaccination rates have led to outbreaks of diseases such as measles and whooping cough, and tragic real-world cases—like the death of 8-year-old Liam Dahlberg from Hib—demonstrate the human toll of these policies.",
