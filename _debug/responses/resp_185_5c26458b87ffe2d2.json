The strike penetrated Russian air defences and is seen as a strategic response to ongoing attacks, such as the overnight air assault on Kyiv. Ukraine argues that such long-range capabilities are essential for countering Russian aggression, despite Kremlin warnings against such weapons. Western leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European allies, have committed to increasing pressure on Russia’s economy and defence industry. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has signaled reluctance to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, citing concerns over ceasefire conditions and the lack of readiness to end the war. The conflict continues with Russia maintaining control over about 20% of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea, and with the war having lasted since February 2022.",
