  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following the failed Alaska summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in summer 2025, the United States has shifted its policy by increasing intelligence sharing with Ukraine to include deep-in-Russia targets, particularly energy infrastructure. This reversal occurred after Trump’s administration initially restricted such strikes ahead of the summit. Now, with no explicit limitations, Ukraine is pursuing a strategy of long-range attacks using U.S.-supplied weapons like the Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) and, potentially, Tomahawk cruise missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to provide these weapons to pressure Russia, especially in the context of frozen front lines and over a million casualties. Trump has signaled openness to supplying Tomahawks, contingent on Russia changing its stance, and acknowledged Ukraine’s capability to strike cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg if armed. Despite concerns from Moscow over nuclear implications and operational challenges due to air patrols, the policy shift reflects a broader effort to re-energize negotiations and apply strategic pressure on Russia.",
