The video, released in response to the 'No Kings' protests, features Loggins' performance without permission and is seen as politically provocative and potentially divisive. While such uses of music are generally legal if royalties are paid, performers can prohibit specific uses, and Loggins has publicly objected, expressing concern about the division of society. The incident echoes past legal actions by musicians like The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, who have sued Trump over political use of their music. The White House has not directly addressed the request, instead sharing a 'Top Gun' film still with a symbolic caption, indicating a lack of direct engagement with the artistic objections.",
