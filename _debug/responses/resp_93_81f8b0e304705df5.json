  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard officer to dig up dirt on Virginia Giuffre, a woman who accused him of sexual assault and was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s trafficking network. The investigation stems from media reports and the release of emails showing Andrew’s continued contact with Epstein, including a note from February 28, 2011, where he said they were 'in this together.' Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, had no criminal record, and her family welcomed Andrew’s relinquishment of titles but urged King Charles III to fully strip his title. Andrew settled a civil suit with Giuffre in 2022, acknowledging her suffering but denying wrongdoing. British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband condemned the use of a close protection officer in a smear campaign, stating such actions are unacceptable. The scandal has deepened public distrust in the monarchy and reignited years of criticism over Andrew’s ties to Epstein and lack of empathy for victims.",
