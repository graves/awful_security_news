A 25-year-old fan named Meg criticized his concert at The Anthem in Washington, DC, calling it one of the worst experiences she's ever had due to an overwhelming youth audience and immature jokes, including a 'Sombr dating show' skit involving teens calling toxic exes. Sombr responded by calling the criticism 'TikTok drama,' arguing that as a young artist, it's natural to have a younger audience, and that his humor is lighthearted and only lasts five minutes of the show. He also used the trend of 'touching grass' as a symbolic gesture to promote living in the moment. The incident highlights broader tensions between artistic expression, audience expectations, and social media culture, particularly when content targeting youth demographics is viewed by older fans as inappropriate or cringey.",
