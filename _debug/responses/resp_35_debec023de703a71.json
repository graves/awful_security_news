  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man from Kibbutz Nir Oz, has been identified as the tenth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement. Israel remains frustrated over the slow return of the remaining 18 deceased hostages, accusing Hamas of withholding bodies and using them as leverage. Hamas claims it has handed over all accessible remains, but Israeli intelligence suspects it knows the locations of some missing bodies. Aid access remains severely limited, with only two crossings open and the Rafah crossing still closed, due to Israel's condition that it will open only if Hamas fulfills its obligations. Humanitarian agencies like the World Food Programme report critical shortages of food. Negotiations for Phase Two—covering Gaza’s demilitarization, governance, and an International Stabilization Force (ISF)—are ongoing in Egypt, with the Trump administration proposing a technocratic Palestinian governance structure and international oversight. However, Hamas has not clearly committed to disarmament or power transfer, and key international actors are still negotiating mandates for the ISF, highlighting deep divisions in the peace process.",
