  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A Human Rights Watch report reveals that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, may be indirectly fueling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating within protected areas such as the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and Terra Nossa sustainable development area. The investigation finds that cattle from illegally deforested land are moved through a system of transit permits (GTAs) that do not track individual animals, allowing their origins to be concealed—effectively 'laundering' them into JBS’s supply chain. Despite JBS’s past commitments to supplier traceability and a 2026 deadline for supplier declarations, the company remains unable to guarantee the legality of its beef supply. Experts and advocacy groups argue that Brazil’s current system is inadequate and that stronger federal oversight, public access to GTA data, and enforcement are urgently needed. The report is especially significant as it is released just before COP30, highlighting the global relevance of corporate accountability in agriculture and climate change.",
