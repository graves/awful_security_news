  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently experiencing a full shutdown due to the failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills, marking a significant political crisis. This follows the longest government shutdown in nearly 50 years, which occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. During that time, approximately 800,000 federal employees were affected, with 300,000 furloughed and 500,000 exempted from pay. Since 1990, there have been six shutdowns, a trend linked to increasing political polarization. The current shutdown is further complicated by Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow House majority and the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to end debate—voting power the GOP currently lacks. This political stalemate underscores the fragility of bipartisan funding agreements in Congress.",
