  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is reviewing the legitimacy of Alina Habba’s appointment as US attorney for New Jersey, which the lower court ruled violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba, a former attorney for Donald Trump, was initially appointed as interim US attorney and later delegated full authority by the Attorney General. DOJ lawyer Henry Whitaker defended the appointment, claiming it follows established practices of delegation and citing a Biden-era attorney who served without confirmation. However, opposition counsel Abbe Lowell argued that delegating full US attorney powers—such as overseeing investigations and managing personnel—is unprecedented and unlawful. The case has broader implications, with similar challenges underway in Nevada and California, and is linked to legal actions involving former FBI Director James Comey and former White House aide Lindsey Halligan. Habba attributes the appointment delays to congressional obstruction, and the case raises critical questions about executive authority, the role of Senate confirmation, and the boundaries of delegated power in federal appointments.",
