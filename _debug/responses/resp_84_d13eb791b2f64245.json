Among the stolen pieces are a sapphire diadem, a reliquary brooch, and a diamond bow brooch, all crafted by 19th-century Parisian jewelers and containing diamonds of immense historical value, such as the Mazarin diamonds. The theft is described by art expert Arthur Brand as a 'national disaster' due to the cultural and emotional significance of these royal heirlooms. While one item — Eugénie’s crown — was recovered near the scene, it was damaged. Experts believe the thieves dismantled and sold the stolen jewelry, particularly due to their gold and silver content. The Louvre, which acquired many of these items through historical transfers, including from the Orléans family and private collectors, is now confronting a crisis in the security of its crown jewels and national heritage.",
