  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in modern American culture, driven by fashion, media, and political movements. It traces the mythologized cowboy from 19th-century performances like Buffalo Bill’s Wild West shows to its current dominance in advertising, TV series, and political discourse, especially under conservative administrations. While popular culture celebrates the cowboy as a symbol of patriotism, hard work, and rugged individualism, the article highlights that this image is largely a myth, divorced from the historical reality in which Mexican, Native, and enslaved Black Americans were the foundational laborers. The article critiques the whitewashing of this history, pointing to recent efforts by Black cowboys and cultural figures like Beyoncé and Gabriela Hasbun to reclaim and celebrate their contributions. Despite these efforts, mainstream portrayals continue to emphasize romanticized, white, idealized versions of the cowboy, reflecting a broader cultural trend of conservative politics and resistance to urban liberal values.",
