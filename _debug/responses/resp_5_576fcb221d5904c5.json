  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses severe threats to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, particularly through flash flooding and mudslides due to heavy rainfall—potentially over one foot. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, the East Coast and Florida could face rough weather. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season and the first to form in the Caribbean, a region now exceptionally warm due to climate change. This warming trend contributes to more rapid storm intensification, as seen in recent hurricanes like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. The storm’s path remains uncertain, with scenarios ranging from a northern track through Hispaniola to a westward journey toward Central America. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, but tropical systems can still form afterward.",
