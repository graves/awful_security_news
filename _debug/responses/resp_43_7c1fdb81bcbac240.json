  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew has formally announced that he will give up the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York, following decades of public scrutiny and allegations linked to Jeffrey Epstein and ties with an alleged Chinese spy. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and other members of the royal family, comes after a 2015 lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew participated in sex trafficking and sexual abuse with underage girls, including on Epstein’s private island and at his London home. Though Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied these claims, the accusations led to significant public pressure, resulting in the stripping of his military titles and charitable roles. A 2024 tribunal revealed that Yang Tengbo, a man with alleged espionage links, was authorized by Andrew to represent him in business dealings with Chinese investors. Following a settlement in 2022 and Giuffre's death in April 2025, the situation remains under public and media scrutiny. Prince Andrew will no longer attend royal events like Christmas celebrations, though he will retain his title as 'Prince' due to being the son of Queen Elizabeth II and will continue to live at Royal Lodge. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson will now be known only as Sarah Ferguson, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie retain their full titles.",
