  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced the end of all US financial payments and subsidies to Colombia, criticizing President Gustavo Petro for failing to curb drug production, which he claims has been enabled by decades of US funding. The US has provided around $210 million in aid this fiscal year, with Colombia being the world’s top cocaine producer. The dispute escalates from prior tensions, including a US military strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean that killed three men, and a controversial visa revocation of Petro after he criticized US actions. Trump personally attacks Petro, calling him an 'illegal drug leader', while Petro responds with a cultural rebuttal referencing Gabriel García Márquez’s 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', asserting that his leadership is rooted in socialism, solidarity, and human life rather than profit or violence. The incident reflects a deepening diplomatic rift between the US and Colombia over migration, drug trafficking, and foreign policy.",
