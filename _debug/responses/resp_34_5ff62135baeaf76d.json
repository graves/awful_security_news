  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from a recent ceasefire deal in Gaza — which ended a two-year war and secured the release of 20 hostages — to push for similar diplomatic breakthroughs with Russia and China. While he has engaged in high-stakes negotiations with Vladimir Putin in Budapest and with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, skepticism remains over whether such peace efforts will succeed due to the nuclear status of both nations and their lack of dependence on U.S. support. The fragile Gaza deal is also challenged by Hamas’s failure to return the remains of deceased hostages, highlighting the difficulty in enforcing compliance. Trump has also shifted U.S. foreign policy by authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela and offering financial backing to Argentina. In Ukraine, Trump declined to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles to President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing concerns about war escalation and winter risks, signaling a more cautious approach to military support. Ultimately, while Trump believes he has the momentum and leverage to end conflicts, experts caution that past diplomatic successes are not easily transferable to the complex, asymmetric dynamics of the Ukraine and Russia-China conflicts.",
