    "Strong winds capable of knocking out power, damaging or uprooting trees, and large hail (quarter-size to golf ball size) are the main threats.",
    "Isolated tornadoes may form quickly with little warning due to atmospheric spin.",
    "Heavy rain could trigger flash flooding, especially in drought-affected areas like the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys and the Ozarks.",
    "Unusually warm Gulf waters are fueling the storm system by providing extra moisture.",
    "Fall temperatures are 10 to 20 degrees above average, with 80s expected as far north as Indiana and Ohio.",
    "Columbus, Ohio, may reach its daily record high of 83°F; San Antonio, Texas, may approach a daily record of 93°F.",
    "The jet stream strengthens in fall and winter, enhancing storm energy when warm, humid Gulf air interacts with cooler air from the north.",
    "The South and lower Midwest are especially vulnerable to severe thunderstorms during fall and winter.",
    "Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly as daytime ones, according to a 2022 study.",
    "Colder weather is expected in the coming weeks, but severe storms will still occur, emphasizing year-round preparedness."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes, and heavy rain are threatening the South and Midwest this weekend, particularly in northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and parts of Arkansas and the mid-Mississippi Valley. The storms are fueled by unusually warm Gulf waters and a strengthening jet stream, creating a clash of warm, humid air from the south and cooler air from the north. High temperatures across the region—up to 20 degrees above average—add to the instability. Key cities like Little Rock, Memphis, Shreveport, and Paducah are at high risk, with strong winds capable of damaging infrastructure and large hail potentially reaching golf ball size. Although the region is in a drought, the rain could trigger flash flooding. A 2022 study highlights that nighttime tornadoes are significantly more deadly, underscoring the need for year-round vigilance and preparedness, especially as colder weather approaches.",
