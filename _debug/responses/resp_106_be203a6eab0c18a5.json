    "Jean-Pierre describes the 2024 presidential debate as a moment when she first observed President Joe Biden appearing hoarse and sick, leading her to recognize how optics and media narratives could exploit perceived vulnerabilities.",

    "Jean-Pierre's decision to identify as an independent is framed not as a political defection, but as a call for accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics and the failure of Democrats to anticipate the rise of Project 2025 and anti-DEI policies."

In her new book, *Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines*, she details how the 2024 presidential debate exposed concerns about Biden’s health, which she observed firsthand, and how public figures like Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney contributed to a perception of Democratic division. She also reflects on the bias she faced as a Black woman in a high-profile role and highlights the political loyalty and sense of inclusion among Black women and other marginalized communities within the party. Jean-Pierre frames her independent status not as a defection but as a call to accountability and a broader conversation about the future of American politics, urging citizens to remain engaged and to reject silence as complicity.",
