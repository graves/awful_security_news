    "The US Tomahawk cruise missile is a proven, reliable weapon used in multiple conflicts, including Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen, and remains effective due to its precision, long range (1,600–2,500 km), and low-altitude flight profile.",
    "Despite its effectiveness, Ukraine currently lacks the capability to launch Tomahawk missiles due to the absence of a ground-launched system like the Typhon, which is necessary for firing the missile from land.",
    "The Russian government has expressed strong concern over the potential supply of Tomahawks to Ukraine, viewing it as a hostile act that could threaten global security and trigger nuclear escalation, with SVR head Sergey Naryshkin explicitly warning of such risks.",
    "While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for Tomahawk delivery to enable strikes on key Russian infrastructure like the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov, US leadership under Trump has denied such deliveries, citing need for US security and limited stockpiles.",
    "Ukraine is pursuing its own cruise missile program, the Flamingo, which is said to have similar range to the Tomahawk, but its capabilities remain uncertain and production is limited due to insufficient resources.",
    "Even if a few dozen Tomahawks were delivered, they would not be a game-changer in the war — Ukraine still needs more robust air defenses to counter Russia’s increasing missile and drone attacks."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses the potential delivery of US-made Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, a proven weapon system used in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, with a range of 1,600–2,500 km and advanced guidance systems. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has advocated for these missiles to allow strikes on deep Russian targets like the Shahed drone factory and Engels-2 Air Base, US President Donald Trump has denied such deliveries, citing limited stockpiles and the need for US security. Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin and SVR head Sergey Naryshkin, views the supply of Tomahawks as a hostile act that could trigger nuclear escalation. Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launcher (Typhon) to use the missiles, and its own Flamingo missile program remains underdeveloped. Despite these obstacles, the article emphasizes that a few Tomahawks could cause significant damage, but Ukraine still urgently needs more air defense systems to counter Russia’s increasing missile and drone attacks. The broader context includes a $90 billion weapons deal being pursued by Zelensky through meetings with US manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.",
