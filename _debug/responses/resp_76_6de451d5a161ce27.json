  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major global outage on October 20, 2025, disrupting millions of users worldwide by making banking, social media, and e-commerce services inoperable. The outage originated in the Domain Name System (DNS), which failed to route traffic to AWS’s databases, including DynamoDB, causing apps to lose access to critical data. Although the issue lasted only a few hours and was resolved by 6:35 AM ET, the event highlights a critical vulnerability in the internet’s architecture: its overreliance on centralized cloud providers like AWS. Experts note that the lack of redundancy and competitive alternatives means that a single point of failure in one major cloud region can have cascading, widespread effects. This incident echoes past major outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software bug and previous AT&T network failures, underscoring systemic risks in modern digital infrastructure.",
