    "John Bolton is charged with 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing it with family members lacking security clearances.",
    "The charges stem from actions during Bolton’s time as Trump’s national security adviser, including a cyber hack allegedly linked to Iran that exposed sensitive national defense data.",
    "Unlike the cases of James Comey and Letitia James, Trump did not directly push or force prosecutors to bring charges in Bolton’s case, though he repeatedly accused Bolton of crimes and called for prosecution.",
    "The case is notable because a federal judge in 2020 had already warned that Bolton likely violated national security rules by mishandling classified information.",
    "The indictment includes more detail than previous cases and alleges that Bolton failed to notify authorities about a cyber breach that could have exposed sensitive information to hostile foreign actors.",
    "The stakes are higher than in prior cases—Bolton’s alleged actions could have exposed national defense secrets to foreign adversaries, unlike the minor financial fraud in James’s case or false statements in Comey’s case.",
    "Despite not being directly orchestrated by Trump in the same way as in the Comey and James cases, Bolton’s prosecution remains part of a broader pattern of targeting political opponents with legal action.",
    "Trump has publicly accused Bolton of crimes and used him as a rallying point in his reelection campaign, and Bolton was stripped of his security clearance and security detail despite facing an alleged assassination threat."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing sensitive data with family members without proper clearances. The case differs from those of James Comey and Letitia James in that Trump did not directly pressure prosecutors to bring charges, though he repeatedly accused Bolton of crimes and used him as a political rallying point. A federal judge previously warned in 2020 that Bolton likely jeopardized national security, and now, the indictment alleges that a cyber actor linked to Iran accessed Bolton’s personal email and that he failed to report the breach. The stakes are significantly higher than in prior cases, as the alleged exposure of national defense information to foreign actors raises serious national security concerns. While the prosecution is conducted by experienced, nonpartisan prosecutors, the broader context includes Trump's actions—such as stripping Bolton of his security clearance and publicly branding him as a 'deep state' enemy—indicating a politically motivated pattern of targeting political adversaries.",
