  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia launched a coordinated and highly precise attack on Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5, using 465 modified drones and 32 missiles to destroy a vital power infrastructure. This marks a significant shift in Russian tactics, moving from general strikes to targeted destruction of energy systems, including power stations and natural gas delivery facilities. The attack left the city without power and water for much of the day, affecting nearly four million residents and forcing widespread reliance on generators, batteries, and gas-powered alternatives. Russia has also upgraded its missiles and drones to evade Western air defenses, reducing interception rates from 37% to 6% between August and September 2025. Meanwhile, corruption in Ukraine’s anti-drone systems has undermined efforts to protect infrastructure, with officials allegedly inflating costs and misallocating funds. Experts warn that Ukraine is now facing a severe winter with minimal energy reserves, and civilians are preparing through personal measures like purchasing fuel and installing wood stoves. The article underscores that Russia’s strategy is now focused on weakening Ukraine’s ability to withstand winter conditions, posing a direct threat to civilian survival and national stability.",
