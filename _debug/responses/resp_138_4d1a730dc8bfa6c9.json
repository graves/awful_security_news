  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bolivia has elected Rodrigo Paz as its first conservative president in 20 years, marking a dramatic end to decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Paz, who won 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election, has pledged to rebuild relations with the United States, reject an IMF bailout, and secure vital fuel imports through coordination with the Trump administration. He emphasized the need to 'put the house in order' by reforming the judiciary and addressing fiscal mismanagement, while also facing protests over the election’s legitimacy and deep-seated public skepticism of past political fraud. His running mate, Edman Lara, helped mobilize rural and working-class voters through anti-corruption messaging. Despite promising targeted subsidies and economic reforms, Paz faces the challenge of balancing fiscal responsibility with social equity, especially as Indigenous communities fear that constitutional changes could undermine their political representation. The shift reflects a broader regional realignment in Latin America toward democratic and anti-authoritarian governance.",
