  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network, has published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' in which she alleges that she was raped and violently abused by a high-profile political figure — described in the US version as a 'well-known Prime Minister' and in the UK version as a 'former minister' — widely believed to be Prince Andrew. The memoir alleges that Giuffre was trafficked to Andrew at age 18, subjected to choking and sexual assault, and that Andrew’s team attempted to discredit her by hiring online trolls and instructing a bodyguard to dig up her background. Despite public denials, newly discovered emails show Andrew maintained contact with Epstein in 2011, contradicting his claim of having broken off ties. The memoir's publication intensifies a transatlantic scandal involving powerful figures, with Prince Andrew having previously settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022 for millions. The revelations deepen the public scrutiny and disgrace of Prince Andrew, who has since dropped the title 'Duke of York' but retained 'Prince,' stating he prioritized family and national duty.",
