  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance expressed optimism about the durability of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, downplaying concerns despite private anxieties within the Trump administration. Vance declined to set deadlines for Hamas' disarmament or the return of Israeli hostages, emphasizing the need for gradual security and humanitarian implementation. The visit, led by Vance, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, aims to reassure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the US commitment to the deal. Tensions rose after Israel accused Hamas of killing two soldiers, prompting retaliatory airstrikes and renewed fears of ceasefire collapse. US officials stress that the next 30 days are vital for the ceasefire to hold and for negotiations to progress. Trump expressed skepticism about Hamas leadership’s role in the attack, suggesting it was a 'rebellion' within the group, and threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if necessary, while still maintaining hope for compliance. The broader effort reflects the administration's push for a sustainable peace plan, including a long-term 20-point proposal.",
