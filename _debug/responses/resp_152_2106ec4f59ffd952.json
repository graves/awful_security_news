    "Countries like China, the EU, Brazil, Britain, and Singapore had previously supported the framework, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to regulate shipping emissions, by at least 12 months following threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on countries supporting the measure. The framework, which would have introduced a $380 per metric tonne carbon tax on shipping emissions, had already been approved in April 2025 by 176 member states. Trump’s public outcry and economic threats—including visa restrictions and port levies—led to a vote to delay the adoption, with 57 members supporting the postponement and 49 opposing. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain were affected, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed the plan. The decision has been widely criticized by climate advocates, including Vanuatu’s minister Ralph Regenvanu and the International Chamber of Shipping, as undermining global climate action and creating uncertainty for the shipping industry’s transition to clean energy. This setback reflects a broader geopolitical conflict between climate action and fossil fuel interests, particularly in the U.S. and parts of the Global South.",
