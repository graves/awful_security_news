  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali, Delhi faced a severe air pollution crisis, with the Air Quality Index reaching 360—classified as 'severe'—due to widespread use of firecrackers, even in violation of court-ordered restrictions. Despite the Supreme Court allowing the use of less-polluting 'green' crackers during limited times, people continued setting off fireworks, especially past midnight, leading to elevated levels of PM2.5 that were 24 times above WHO safety limits. Contributing factors include low wind speeds, crop stubble burning in neighboring states, and ongoing vehicular emissions. The city activated the Graded Response Action Plan to curb pollution, but residents reported poor visibility and respiratory discomfort, indicating a deep-rooted environmental and public health challenge. This event underscores the difficulty of enforcing pollution controls during cultural festivals and the urgent need for stronger public awareness and enforcement.",
