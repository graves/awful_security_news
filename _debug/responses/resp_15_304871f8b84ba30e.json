    "The storm could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, increasing the risk of flash flooding and mudslides due to mountainous terrain.",
    "Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this year have undergone extreme rapid intensification, highlighting a growing trend linked to global warming.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where it could bring over a foot of rain, leading to dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is unlikely, rough seas and rip currents could affect the East Coast, with Florida being a potential secondary impact zone. Melissa is the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season and the first to develop in the Caribbean, fueled by abnormally warm sea temperatures linked to climate change. This storm follows a trend of extreme rapid intensification seen in other recent hurricanes, highlighting growing impacts of fossil fuel pollution on extreme weather events.",
