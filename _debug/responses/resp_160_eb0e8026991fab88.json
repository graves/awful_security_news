  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following a week of deadly border clashes, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The agreement aims to establish lasting peace and stability, with both countries committing to stop attacks on each other’s forces, civilians, and infrastructure. Pakistan accuses the Taliban of allowing militant groups like the TTP and BLA to operate from Afghan territory, while the Taliban denies providing safe havens. The ceasefire includes follow-up talks in Istanbul on October 25 to verify implementation and establish a monitoring mechanism. Analysts question the effectiveness of targeting Afghanistan to curb cross-border terrorism, citing a lack of evidence and the independent nature of groups like the TTP. This development is significant for regional security and diplomatic relations in South Asia.",
