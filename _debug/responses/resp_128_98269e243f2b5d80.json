  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has officially renounced his royal titles and honors—including the Duke of York, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter—after renewed public scrutiny surrounding his alleged connection to Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2024, alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and had sexual relations with Andrew when she was 17. Andrew previously denied the claims and faced backlash during a 2019 BBC interview in which he dismissed her recollections without empathy. A 2022 court settlement acknowledged Epstein as a sex trafficker and Giuffre as a victim. The controversy has also extended to Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who faced public backlash after an email to Epstein was published. Further concerns were raised about Andrew’s financial dealings with Tengbo Yang, a suspected Chinese spy barred from the UK. This decision marks a significant fall from grace for a once-celebrated royal figure and underscores ongoing public distrust of the royal family’s accountability and transparency.",
