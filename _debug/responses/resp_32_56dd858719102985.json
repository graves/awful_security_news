  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo's 50+ year giant panda program ends in 2025 as China sends the last pandas — Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, marking the conclusion of a diplomatic initiative that began in 1972 during President Nixon’s visit to China. The program, once a symbol of goodwill and 'panda diplomacy,' has declined due to worsening US-China relations, public backlash over panda treatment in Memphis, and a shift in China’s diplomatic outreach to countries like Russia and Qatar. While the US was the first to host pandas, only Mexico City now retains a panda in the Americas with Xin Xin. The U.S. zoos, including Zoo Atlanta and Edinburgh Zoo, are also set to lose their pandas, with Atlanta’s contract expiring next year. China maintains that the program supports conservation and global biodiversity, and the pandas will return to the Chengdu Research Base, where conservation efforts have improved the population. Despite the end of the program, the National Zoo remains hopeful for a future return, and public figures like Jill Biden are being cited as potential advocates. This shift reflects broader diplomatic realignment and highlights the intersection of wildlife diplomacy, public sentiment, and geopolitical tension.",
