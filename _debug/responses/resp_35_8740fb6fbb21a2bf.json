Sombr responded by calling the criticism 'TikTok drama,' arguing that as a young artist, he performs jokes to keep things light and fun, and that the audience's age group is naturally younger than his. He also used the social media phrase 'touch grass' to convey a message of youthful, carefree living. The incident highlights tensions between artistic expression, audience expectations, and the role of social media in shaping public opinion on live performances.",
