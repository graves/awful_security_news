  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Two major European clinical trials have found that a full-spectrum cannabis oil, VER-01 developed by Vertanical, significantly reduces low back pain and outperforms both a placebo and opioids in pain relief and side effect profile. The studies, published in Nature Medicine, show patients experienced a 30% pain reduction over 12 weeks compared to 20% with placebo, with fewer gastrointestinal issues and no signs of dependency. While the results are promising, experts caution that the findings are specific to this formulation and not a universal solution for all chronic pain. In the U.S., the FDA requires replication of these studies, which could delay approval by years, despite growing interest from patients and clinicians who see cannabis as a safer, more effective alternative to opioids. The lack of FDA-approved cannabis products for pain—aside from Epidiolex, which lacks THC—creates a gap in treatment options, especially in light of public concerns about quality and consistency in state-legal products.",
