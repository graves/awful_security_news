  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "After Diwali, Delhi faced a severe air pollution crisis, with the Air Quality Index reaching 360 — a 'severe' level — due to widespread use of traditional and green crackers, despite a court-ordered restriction on firecrackers. The city, already plagued by year-round pollution from vehicles and stubble burning, saw pollution worsen due to low wind speeds and continued fireworks beyond the allowed hours. Even green crackers, which emit less pollution, contributed to toxic levels of PM2.5, far exceeding WHO safety guidelines. Residents reported poor visibility, breathing difficulties, and a pervasive smog, while the Graded Response Action Plan was activated to curb pollution. The incident highlights the failure of enforcement and the need for stronger public awareness and environmental regulations to protect public health in urban India.",
