  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, has died at age 74 in Morristown, New Jersey. As the first of the original four founding members to pass away, his death marks a significant moment in the band’s legacy. Frehley, known as 'Space Ace' or the 'Spaceman,' was central to Kiss’s theatrical performances, including pyrotechnic guitar effects, and helped shape the band’s identity during their peak in the 1970s. Though he left the band in 1982 and later rejoined in the 1990s, his influence on the glam metal genre—including bands like Mötley Crüe, Poison, and even heavier rock acts such as Metallica and Pantera—is undeniable. He was also praised by contemporaries like Bret Michaels and collaborated with country icon Garth Brooks. Kiss was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, though a dispute over the inclusion of Frehley and drummer Peter Criss delayed the performance. The band’s intellectual property was sold in 2024 to Pophouse Entertainment Group for over $300 million. Frehley’s death is a poignant reminder of the cultural impact of 1970s glam rock and the enduring influence of its original members.",
