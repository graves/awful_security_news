  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to reduce shipping emissions by introducing a carbon pricing system, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the initiative. The NZF, which would impose a $380 penalty per metric tonne of excess CO2 emissions, was already approved in April but was postponed by at least 12 months due to political pressure. Key supporters such as China, the EU, and Britain were influenced by the threat, while nations like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted or withdrew support. The decision undermines global climate goals, with industry leaders and small island states condemning the delay as both politically motivated and environmentally damaging. The IMO remains committed to regulating shipping emissions, but the reversal reflects broader geopolitical tensions over climate policy, particularly with the U.S. reasserting fossil fuel interests under Trump’s leadership.",
