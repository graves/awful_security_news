The bodies were transferred through the International Committee of the Red Cross and identified by the Israel Defense Forces. The return of these remains marks progress in the ceasefire deal, which also includes the release of over 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and a partial military withdrawal from Gaza. However, controversy persists over Hamas's failure to return all deceased hostages, with accusations of difficulty locating bodies amid rubble. Despite the agreement, violence flared up, and Israel continues to face criticism over the scale of destruction in Gaza, with over 68,000 deaths reported by Hamas health authorities since October 2023.",
