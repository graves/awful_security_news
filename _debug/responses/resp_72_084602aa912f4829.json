  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, President Donald Trump suggested that weight-loss drugs like Ozempic could be priced at $150 per month, citing a disparity in drug pricing between the US and Europe. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz, clarified that no such price reduction has been negotiated, the announcement sparked widespread excitement among patients and medical professionals who have struggled with the high costs of GLP-1 medications. Stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly fell significantly, reflecting investor concerns. Experts note that while $150 would represent a major improvement in affordability—especially compared to current prices of over $1,000 per month—many patients still face financial barriers, and compounded versions of the drugs, though cheaper, are unregulated and potentially unsafe. The proposal is tied to Trump’s 'Most Favored Nation' drug pricing initiative, which aims to align US drug prices with those in peer countries. While the promise is seen as potentially transformative for patient access, it remains speculative, with no formal agreement or timeline in place.",
