    "The memo is framed as a pragmatic step to improve accuracy and coordination in messaging to Congress, avoiding contradictory statements and ensuring alignment with departmental priorities.",
    "The policy is consistent with a 2006 Defense Department directive that mandates central coordination of legislative activities, though enforcement has not previously been strict.",

    "The Pentagon Inspector General office is explicitly exempt from the policy, indicating internal accountability is still preserved.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring all Defense Department personnel, including senior military officials, to obtain prior approval from the Pentagon’s Office of Legislative Affairs before engaging with Congress. The policy, effective October 15, 2025, applies to civilian leaders, combatant commanders, and intelligence offices, with the Inspector General office exempt. While the Pentagon frames the policy as a way to improve messaging consistency and prevent contradictions, critics argue it reflects a pattern of restricting communication, undermining congressional oversight and transparency. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, Dane Hughes, is leading a review to assess current practices and recommend improvements. Critics, including Senate aides and former Pentagon officials, question the practicality and impact of the policy, noting that thousands of routine engagements occur monthly and would be logistically difficult to coordinate under the new rules.",
