  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli soldier killed on October 7, 2023, during a Hamas-led attack, has been officially identified as a deceased hostage returned under the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire agreement. His identification marks the 13th such transfer since the ceasefire was signed on October 9, 2025. While the agreement requires Hamas to return all deceased hostages within 72 hours, Israeli intelligence and officials have expressed concern that Hamas may not be able to recover all bodies due to extensive war damage in Gaza. A prior body handed over by Hamas was misidentified, raising concerns about compliance. The US, particularly President Donald Trump, has threatened to 'eradicate' Hamas if it violates the agreement, adding diplomatic pressure. High-level negotiations between US envoys and Israeli military officials continue to address ceasefire violations and recovery challenges. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has expressed deep sorrow to Haimi’s family, underscoring the human cost of the conflict.",
