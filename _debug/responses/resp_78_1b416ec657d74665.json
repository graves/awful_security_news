  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, focusing on whether such a ban violates the Second Amendment. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen convicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm and drugs, with prosecutors arguing that habitual drug use poses a public safety risk. A lower court dismissed the charge, citing a 2022 Supreme Court precedent that requires gun prohibitions to have historical roots. The 5th Circuit upheld that precedent, ruling that prohibitions against habitual users lack historical support. The Trump administration appealed, claiming that such users present dangerous risks, especially when impaired and interacting with law enforcement. The case is complicated by political dimensions, including the prior conviction of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, under the same law, and the assertion that Hemani traveled to Iran to celebrate the killing of Qasem Soleimani. Legal arguments center on whether the law’s historical foundation is sound, especially in light of the growing legalization of marijuana in nearly half of U.S. states. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments next year and issue a decision by the end of June 2026.",
