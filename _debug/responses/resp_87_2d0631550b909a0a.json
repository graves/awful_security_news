  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the October 2025 government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it would use Section 32 tariff revenue — traditionally supporting child nutrition programs — to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million low-income women and children. The move came after Congress failed to pass a spending bill for fiscal year 2026, threatening to shut down WIC within days. While the National WIC Association welcomed the effort, it emphasized uncertainty around funding amounts, delivery timelines, and long-term sustainability. Legal experts questioned the administration’s authority to redirect funds without congressional authorization. The decision reflects broader political tensions, with Republican leaders blaming Democrats for the shutdown and highlighting bipartisan concern over vulnerable populations. Despite the executive action, advocates stress that long-term stability and adequate funding remain critical for WIC’s continued effectiveness.",
