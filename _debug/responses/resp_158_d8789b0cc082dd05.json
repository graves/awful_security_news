  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Palestinian solidarity activist, was detained in March 2025 after his activism at Columbia University drew government attention. The U.S. government seeks to deport him, claiming his presence has adverse foreign policy consequences, while his lawyers argue that such deportation powers are unconstitutional and violate free speech protections. Khalil was released in June by a lower court through a habeas corpus petition, but the deportation case continues, with the immigration judge’s decision being appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals and potentially to a circuit court. The ACLU, led by Bobby Hodgson, asserts that ideas are not illegal and that the government cannot criminalize dissent. A separate ruling by Judge William Young found the Trump administration’s crackdown on activists unlawful, as it aimed to silence criticism of Israel. Khalil remains free, but the legal saga underscores a broader conflict between immigration enforcement and free expression in the U.S.",
