  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A sophisticated AI voice scam targeted wealthy Italian businessmen, using a deepfake voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request over 1 million euros. The scam, which occurred in early February 2025, was exposed when Crosetto himself received a call from a businessman claiming to have been contacted by a 'General' with fake account details. Research from Queen Mary University of London confirms that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices, with participants often perceiving them as more trustworthy. The scam reflects a broader global trend of rising deepfake fraud—over $547 million lost worldwide between January and June 2025—and raises concerns about identity theft, misinformation, and the creation of non-consensual content, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material. In response, governments such as the U.S. and Australia have introduced legal measures to criminalize such misuse, highlighting the urgent need for public awareness, technical detection tools, and regulatory action.",
