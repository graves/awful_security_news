  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a prolonged government shutdown in 2025, national parks including the Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite remained open despite the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees. While some tourists like Nudrat Mahajabin continue to visit, advocates and local businesses express deep concerns about safety, environmental degradation, and economic harm. The absence of rangers has led to illegal activities such as base jumping and drone use, and increased trash accumulation, prompting groups like the National Parks Conservation Association to call for park closures. In Washington, DC, closures of the Smithsonian museums have unexpectedly boosted visits to nearby private museums and transportation ridership. However, businesses in West Virginia and elsewhere report mixed outcomes, with some experiencing no impact and others seeing significant declines. Experts warn that without timely resolution, the shutdown could severely harm local economies and compromise public safety in national parks.",
