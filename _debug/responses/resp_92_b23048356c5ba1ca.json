Despite a citizen petition filed by the Informed Consent Action Network and statements from HHS Secretary Robert F.

Kenvue argues the proposed changes are arbitrary and unsupported by scientific evidence, emphasizing that acetaminophen is one of the most studied and safest medications for pregnant individuals.",
