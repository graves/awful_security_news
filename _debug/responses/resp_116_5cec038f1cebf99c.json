  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a sudden escalation, Israel launched retaliatory strikes across Gaza, targeting Hamas weapons storage, firing posts, and tunnel infrastructure in response to attacks on Israeli troops in the Rafah area. Hamas denied involvement, claiming it was unaware of any attacks and accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and fabricating justifications. The U.S. reported credible intelligence of a planned Hamas attack on civilians, adding urgency to the situation. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the strikes, citing violations of the ceasefire and the deaths of two soldiers, Maj. Yaniv Kula and Staff-Sgt. Itay Ya'avetz. A previous Israeli attack killed a family of 11 in Gaza City, prompting accusations of violations. The ceasefire, brokered by the U.S. and including the release of 20 Israeli hostages, is now under severe strain. Gaza’s media office has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire 80 times. Meanwhile, Hamas has returned the bodies of two Israeli hostages, Ronen Engel and Sontaya Oakkharasri, with 16 others remaining in Gaza. The broader conflict, rooted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that killed 1,144 Israelis and led to over 68,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, continues to escalate, with both sides accusing each other of breaches and calling for renewed enforcement.",
