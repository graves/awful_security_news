  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A deepfake voice scam targeting Italian businessmen used AI to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, leading them to wire funds—only to be uncovered after Crosetto publicly reported the incident. Research from Queen Mary University of London shows that AI-generated voices, especially clones, are now indistinguishable from real human voices, and participants often rate them as more trustworthy. Global losses from deepfake scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. The technology raises serious concerns about identity theft, misinformation, and illegal content creation, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material. In response, governments in the US and Australia have introduced laws to criminalize the publication of such synthetic content, illustrating the growing urgency to regulate AI voice and media generation technologies.",
