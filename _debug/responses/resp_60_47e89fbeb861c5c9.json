  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A working lunch between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia as a condition for ending the war. Trump reportedly raised his voice and emphasized a ceasefire along current battle lines, rejecting Ukraine’s request for long-range missiles. The meeting contradicted Trump’s earlier claim that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. European officials described the encounter as tense, with Trump pushing for a ceasefire at existing frontlines, while Zelensky expressed pessimism about the terms and later endorsed the idea as a step toward peace. Trump denied asking for a full surrender of Donbas but acknowledged significant Russian control over Ukrainian territory. The incident follows a broader shift in Trump’s foreign policy, influenced by his successful mediation in Gaza, and signals that U.S.-Russia negotiations may intensify in Budapest. Despite the tension, both leaders agreed on the need to end the war, with Zelensky calling it a ‘pointed conversation’ that could bring the conflict closer to resolution.",
