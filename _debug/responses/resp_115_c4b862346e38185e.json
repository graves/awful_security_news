  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify both their social behavior and nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. Infected ants self-isolate, while healthy ants—especially nurses—increase distance from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing. When threatened, ants build nests that are more compartmentalized, with longer travel routes and spaced entrances, reducing disease transmission. This combination of social and structural changes provides a form of 'architectural immunity' that has been observed for the first time in non-human species. Experts like Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Sarah Kocher believe these natural strategies could inspire human designs of public spaces to better prevent disease spread, emphasizing that such principles may one day be applied to urban planning and health infrastructure.",
