    "The Caribbean Sea has become extremely warm due to climate change, providing 'rocket fuel' for storms like Melissa, which is part of a broader pattern of extreme rapid intensification observed in recent Atlantic hurricanes (Erin, Gabrielle, Humberto).",
    "Two primary track scenarios are being monitored: one where Melissa turns north toward Hispaniola, potentially becoming a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday, and another where it moves west toward Central America (Nicaragua or Honduras), with less severe impacts in the U.S."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where more than a foot of rain could trigger flash flooding and dangerous mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may experience heavy rain and minor impacts, while the mainland U.S. faces only a low chance of direct impact, mainly through rough surf and rip currents. The storm’s development is tied to the warming of the Caribbean Sea due to climate change and fossil fuel pollution, which has led to more frequent and rapid intensification of storms. Two main track scenarios are being monitored—one heading north toward Hispaniola and the other moving west toward Central America—both of which will bring hazardous weather to various Caribbean regions, highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of island nations to extreme weather events in a warming climate.",
