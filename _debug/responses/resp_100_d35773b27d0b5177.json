  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is calling for urgent action to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before open enrollment begins on November 1, 2025, warning that without intervention, monthly health insurance premiums could soar by $2,000—reaching over $24,000 annually—making coverage unaffordable for millions of working-class Americans earning around $63,000. Jeffries asserts that public pressure will mount as people face rising costs, especially in states like Georgia, Virginia, and Maryland. He opposes Republican proposals for a one-year subsidy extension, arguing they are politically driven and benefit billionaires while simultaneously cutting Medicaid, endangering 14 million people's access to care. He also criticizes GOP legislation to pay federal workers as a 'political ploy' that grants the President unchecked discretion, undermining federal law and the dignity of civil servants. The ongoing government shutdown compounds the crisis, with Democrats demanding bipartisan cooperation to reopen government and resolve the health care crisis through comprehensive, equitable policy action.",
