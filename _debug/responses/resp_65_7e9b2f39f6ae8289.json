Trump has accused Petro of being an illegal drug leader and threatened to cut US subsidies and raise tariffs, which could severely damage Colombia’s economy, as the US is Colombia’s largest trading partner and a major source of aid for drug control. The threat would impact key exports such as coffee, flowers, and gold, potentially leading to job losses and business bankruptcies. Petro has responded with strong criticism, accusing Trump of being rude and ignorant. The feud is further fueled by past incidents, including the revocation of Petro’s US visa after a pro-Palestinian speech. Citizens from various backgrounds express fear about economic and personal consequences, emphasizing that while political leaders clash, the real victims are ordinary people struggling with drug trafficking and economic instability.",
