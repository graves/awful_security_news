  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors in the U.S. Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to serve as James Comey’s defense attorney, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017 during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Fitzgerald denies these claims, asserting that the memos Comey shared with his attorneys were unclassified at the time and that a later upclassification does not negate that fact. The controversy centers on a potential conflict of interest, as Fitzgerald may have been both a witness and a legal representative in the same case. Legal experts emphasize that a person cannot fairly serve as a defense counsel if they were involved in the chain of communication involving classified information. The dispute highlights tensions between legal representation, transparency, and government accountability in high-profile political cases.",
