  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the Medicine Prize for Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, recognizing their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance with implications for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The week-long announcement sequence continues through October 13, with physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics prizes following. The Physics Prize honors John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational work in machine learning, while the Chemistry Prize is shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for AI-driven protein structure prediction. The Literature Prize goes to South Korean author Han Kang for her powerful exploration of trauma and identity. The Peace Prize is awarded to Nihon Hidankyo for its anti-nuclear campaign, amidst controversy surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s claims of deserving the prize for ending wars. Experts caution that such political claims do not align with the committee’s focus on sustainable peace and institutional work, and highlight threats to academic freedom under political interference. The prizes are awarded by distinct institutions, each with a unique mandate, and the full ceremonies will take place on December 10, with global broadcast and public celebration.",
