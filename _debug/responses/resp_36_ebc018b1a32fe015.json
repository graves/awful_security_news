  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "This article reveals the harsh realities of labor exploitation in Guatemala's garment factories, known as maquilas. Despite contributing nearly 10% to Guatemala’s GDP and serving as a key supplier for major US brands like Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren, these factories operate under brutal conditions: workers, mostly women, are subjected to long hours, low wages (less than $500/month), dirty water, and sexual harassment. Korean-owned companies dominate the industry, with nearly two-thirds of investments held by such firms. Workers report being punished for failing quotas, threatened with violence, and silenced when attempting to organize or speak up. Union activity is suppressed, and factory management often blocks labor inspections. Even when factories close, workers are left without severance or pensions, as seen in the case of Rutilia Cano and Alexandra. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has introduced reforms like a 6% wage increase, but enforcement remains weak. US brands benefit from a complex, opaque supply chain that shields them from responsibility. The article raises urgent concerns about global supply chain ethics, gender-based exploitation, and the need for systemic accountability and reform.",
