  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for a ceasefire, contradicting earlier claims that Ukraine could regain all lost territory. The meeting, described by European officials as tense and marked by raised voices, saw Trump push for a ceasefire along current battle lines, citing the war’s devastation and humanitarian toll. Despite Trump’s denial of asking for full surrender of Donbas, the proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin involving territorial exchanges in Donbas and southern Ukraine underscores the complexity of negotiations. Zelensky characterized the dialogue as pointed but constructive, suggesting it could advance peace. This reflects a shift in Trump’s approach to ending the war, especially after his recent peace efforts in Gaza, and highlights growing tensions between U.S. leadership and Ukraine over the terms of a peace settlement.",
