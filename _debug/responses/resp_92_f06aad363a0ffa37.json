  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a decisive 6-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners, the Toronto Blue Jays secured a spot in a deciding Game 7 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS), thanks in part to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting his sixth home run of the postseason. The Blue Jays’ win was fueled by three Mariners fielding errors — two in the second inning — including one by Julio Rodríguez and another by Eugenio Suárez, which allowed early runs. Key contributions came from Addison Barger’s two-run homer and a later RBI single, while rookie pitcher Trey Yesavage delivered a strong performance with 31 splitters and seven strikeouts. The Mariners’ lone run came from Josh Naylor’s homer and a subsequent run by Randy Arozerana, but a wild pitch from Matt Brash in the seventh inning allowed Guerrero Jr. to score, sealing the game. This marks the second Game 7 in Blue Jays history and their first since 1985, while the Mariners face their first Game 7 in franchise history. The ALCS winner will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, with Game 1 scheduled for Friday.",
