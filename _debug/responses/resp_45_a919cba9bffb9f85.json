  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a new immediate ceasefire following over a week of deadly clashes along their 1,600-mile border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The violence, which began on October 10, 2025, was triggered by accusations from Afghanistan that Pakistan conducted airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika, leading to retaliatory attacks. Both countries agreed to stop targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, and critical infrastructure, and to work toward lasting peace. The conflict has resulted in at least 30 civilian deaths and hundreds of injuries, with the Afghanistan Cricket Board withdrawing from a T20I tournament due to violence. Pakistan denies targeting civilians, claiming its strikes were against verified militant camps of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), while the Taliban accused Pakistan of violating the ceasefire by conducting airstrikes. This escalation marks the deadliest outbreak since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and signals growing instability in a region historically characterized by diplomatic ties.",
