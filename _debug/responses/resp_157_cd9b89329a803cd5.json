  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained in March 2025 at Columbia University over his advocacy, leading to a habeas corpus petition that resulted in his release in June 2025. The U.S. government is attempting to deport him, claiming his activism has 'adverse foreign policy consequences' and that he concealed UNRWA work on immigration forms. Legal advocates, including the ACLU, argue that such deportation efforts violate constitutional protections for free speech and that the use of immigration law to silence political dissent is unconstitutional. A federal appeals court is reviewing the lower court’s release order, while the immigration removal case proceeds through administrative and judicial channels. A prior judge ruled that the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on activists is unlawful, reinforcing the significance of Khalil’s case as a test of free expression and the limits of immigration enforcement.",
