  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the June 2025 New York City Democratic primary marks the most significant electoral success for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a major shift in the Democratic Party’s ideological direction. With national membership rising to 80,000 and local chapters like New York City expanding to 11,000 members, the DSA is experiencing unprecedented growth and grassroots energy. This surge is driven by public frustration with corporate power, political establishment inaction, and a desire for bold policy change—such as rent control, childcare for all, and single-payer healthcare. While the DSA’s strong stance on Palestinian liberation and criticism of Israel has energized many, it has also created internal divisions and tensions, including the de-endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and debates over ideological purity. Other progressive candidates, such as Omar Fateh and Katie Wilson, are drawing inspiration from Mamdani’s campaign model, indicating a broader movement toward democratic socialism in U.S. politics. Despite internal fragmentation, the article suggests that democratic socialist ideas are gaining widespread appeal, especially among working-class and younger voters, as reflected in Gallup poll data showing a significant increase in support for socialism among Democrats.",
