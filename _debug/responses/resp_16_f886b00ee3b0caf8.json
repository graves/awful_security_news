  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. conducted its seventh military strike on a boat believed to be linked to a Colombian terrorist organization and involved in drug trafficking in the Caribbean, killing all three individuals on board. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described cartels as the 'Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere' and justified the strike under a new legal framework allowing lethal action against drug traffickers without due process. This reflects a broader Trump administration policy of militarizing drug interdiction, including targeting Venezuela and imposing sanctions on Colombia after President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of killing a Colombian national. The Senate previously resisted efforts to constrain the president’s war powers, with only Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski supporting a bipartisan resolution. The actions have sparked diplomatic tensions and raised concerns about the erosion of legal standards in counter-narcotics operations.",
