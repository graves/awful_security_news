  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown a positive trend, increasing to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 after a 25% decline from 2010 to 2020. Scientists attribute this recovery to improved conservation measures, including new management in Canada and reduced whale injuries and mortalities. Despite progress, threats such as ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements persist. Encouragingly, four mother whales produced calves this year, with shorter reproductive intervals observed, indicating improved reproductive health. However, only 11 calves were born, and experts remain cautiously optimistic, warning that continued threats and potential weakening of legal protections could jeopardize the species’ long-term survival.",
