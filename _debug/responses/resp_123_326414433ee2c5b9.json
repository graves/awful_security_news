  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population, once on the brink of extinction due to a 25% decline from 2010 to 2020, has shown encouraging signs of recovery, increasing to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025. Scientists attribute this slow but steady growth to conservation efforts, including new management measures in Canada and improved protections from ship strikes and fishing gear. While only 11 calves were born in the year, the emergence of new reproductive females signals improved health. Experts remain cautious, noting that continued threats and the need for stronger legal protections are essential for long-term survival.",
