  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress's failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This follows the longest government shutdown in nearly 50 years, which occurred from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, lasting 35 days and costing an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP. The 2018 shutdown involved a partial closure where 300,000 employees were furloughed and others were exempted but unpaid, with backpay provided upon reopening. Since 1990, six shutdowns have occurred, indicating a recurring pattern of partisan deadlock. The current situation is exacerbated by a narrow Republican majority in the House under Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate’s filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to pass legislation, making bipartisan compromise difficult. As of October 2025, the shutdown continues, with no resolution in sight, affecting all federal services and raising concerns about economic and social stability.",
