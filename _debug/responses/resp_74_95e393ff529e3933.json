This rare move, made in consultation with King Charles III and other royal family members, follows years of intense public scrutiny over his alleged connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including being named as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet. The decision comes amid renewed media attention, including a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre and allegations of a close relationship with a Chinese national, Yang Tengbo, accused of espionage. Although Andrew retains the title 'Prince,' he no longer holds any peerage or formal royal roles. Experts and public figures, including Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts, view the step as a necessary but delayed response to long-standing reputational damage. While the royal family has taken this step to protect its image, critics argue it is too little, too late, and questions remain about whether Andrew will fully exit royal life or remain in the background under a private tenancy at the Royal Lodge.",
