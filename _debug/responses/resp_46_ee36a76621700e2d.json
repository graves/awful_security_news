  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown in 2025 due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. This follows a previous 35-day partial shutdown in 2018–2019, the longest in nearly 50 years, which cost the nation an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP and affected around 800,000 federal workers, with 300,000 furloughed. The article highlights the political and structural challenges contributing to these shutdowns, including partisan divisions, narrow congressional majorities, and the Senate filibuster rule, which blocks passage of spending legislation. The current shutdown, unlike the 2018 event, affects all federal operations, with no agencies operating under partial funding, underscoring a significant crisis in the functioning of U.S. governance and public service delivery.",
