  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which continues to captivate Indian audiences 30 years after its release. At the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai, daily screenings of the film reflect a deep emotional connection across generations, with viewers citing nostalgia, familial values, and romantic ideals as key reasons for its appeal. The film, directed by Aditya Chopra, captures the cultural shift of 1990s India — a nation embracing globalization while retaining its identity. It broke new ground by portraying Indian diaspora youth navigating love and tradition, and introduced a powerful narrative of intercultural romance. This story influenced a generation of future films, including 'Pardes', 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham', and 'Kal Ho Naa Ho'. The film cemented the on-screen romance between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as a benchmark in Bollywood. Despite its dated gender politics and lack of character depth in modern standards, the film remains emotionally resonant, symbolizing both personal and national aspirations. The Maratha Mandir’s daily screenings, which have persisted for nearly three decades, stand as a testament to its lasting cultural impact.",
