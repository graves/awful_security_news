  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Representative Adelita Grijalva from Arizona. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires all duly elected members to be seated, and that Johnson’s delay—citing a precedent from Nancy Pelosi—violates constitutional principles and undermines democratic representation. The suit alleges that Johnson’s actions are politically motivated, aimed at avoiding a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and strengthening his leverage in budget negotiations. Grijalva, who won her election in late September 2025, has not spoken to Johnson in 28 days and is attempting to meet with him to resolve the situation. The lawsuit seeks a federal court order allowing a qualified person to administer the oath if Johnson continues to delay. The case raises broader constitutional questions about the Speaker’s authority in seating members and the balance between political strategy and democratic accountability.",
