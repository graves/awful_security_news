  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Bolivians have elected Rodrigo Paz of the centre-right Christian Democratic Party (PDC) as president in a decisive run-off vote, ending 20 years of rule by the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party. With 54.5% of the vote, Paz outpaced right-wing candidate Jorge Quiroga (45.4%), following a major MAS defeat after Evo Morales was barred from running due to term limits and political disagreements. The new administration faces significant economic challenges, including near-25% inflation, critical fuel and food shortages, and a sharp decline in energy revenues from $6.1 billion in 2013 to $1.6 billion in 2024. Paz, the son of former President Jaime Zamora, has pledged a 'capitalism for all' agenda with tax cuts, tariff reductions, and decentralisation, but remains uncertain on continuing the costly fuel subsidy. Despite the political shift, opposition from Evo Morales—still popular among Indigenous communities—remains a major challenge. Vice-president Edmand Lara called for national unity, price stabilization, and an end to corruption.",
