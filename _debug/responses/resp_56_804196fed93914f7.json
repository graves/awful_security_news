  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Louvre museum in Paris has been closed following a brazen heist on October 19, 2025, in which thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery through a window and stole several high-value historical jewelry pieces, including a diadem worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise. The entire operation took just seven minutes, with the robbers leaving on scooters by the Seine. Experts, including French senator Natalie Goulet and Art Recovery International founder Christopher Marinello, believe the jewelry has likely been taken abroad and melted down or sold on the black market as a means of laundering dirty money, indicating possible links to organized crime. French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted serious security failures, such as unsecured windows and public access to a basket lift. The theft has sparked widespread national grief and concern, with author Elaine Sciolino calling it a 'dagger into the heart of France and French history.' The incident echoes past museum thefts, such as the 1911 Mona Lisa heist and the 1998 theft of Camille Corot’s painting, underscoring ongoing vulnerabilities in museum security worldwide.",
