  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In early 2025, a sophisticated AI voice scam targeted Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using artificial intelligence to create deepfake calls that sounded like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, requesting $1 million to rescue kidnapped journalists. Though only Massimo Moratti, former Inter Milan owner, sent money, the incident highlights how AI-generated voices—trained on real human speech data—can now be indistinguishable from real voices, with participants in a University of London study rating AI voices as more trustworthy. Global losses from such scams have surged to over $547 million between January and June 2025. AI deepfakes are also being used to create harmful content, including child sexual abuse material, prompting legal responses in the U.S. and Australia. Experts warn that the growing sophistication of AI voice cloning poses serious risks to personal identity, privacy, and public trust, while also offering positive uses such as restoring voices for speech-impaired individuals.",
