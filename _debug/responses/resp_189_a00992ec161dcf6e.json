  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Nicolas Sarkozy, France's first ex-president to go to jail, begins a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 presidential campaign with money from Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Though he was not convicted of personally receiving funds, he was found guilty of criminal association with aides Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, who arranged secret meetings with Libyan officials via intermediary Ziad Tiakeddine. Sarkozy has appealed the conviction and maintains his innocence, claiming the case is politically motivated and that the sentence reflects a desire for revenge. He is currently held in solitary confinement at La Santé prison in an isolation wing, with limited contact and movement. President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin have publicly expressed support, with Darmanin pledging a visit. The case is part of a broader controversy over political accountability and foreign influence in democratic processes, and a final verdict on Sarkozy's appeal is expected in late November 2025.",
