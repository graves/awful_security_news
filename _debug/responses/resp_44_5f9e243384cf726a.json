    "John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was indicted on 18 counts of sharing classified information through his personal email account with his wife and daughter.",
    "The indictment stems from a combination of an Iranian cyber-attack on Bolton’s email and evidence of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, with prosecutors citing over a thousand pages of emails.",
    "The investigation was initially separated from the earlier probe into Bolton’s 2020 memoir, but both were merged after the 2021 email breach and the subsequent search of his home and office.",
    "Six prosecutors, including Kelly Hayes and Scott Lara, signed the indictment, signaling support from career prosecutors and suggesting a more professional, evidence-based basis for the case.",
    "The case was delayed due to internal resistance and political pressure, but gained momentum after the indictments of Robert Mueller’s former deputy, James, and former FBI director James Comey, increasing pressure on the Justice Department to act.",
    "Trump publicly criticized Bolton for years, calling him a 'lowlife' and claiming he committed treason, and repeatedly urged prosecutors to act, though he did not mention Bolton in his public calls for prosecution.",
    "Bolton’s attorney argues that the documents found were personal diaries, not classified material, and were shared only with immediate family and known to the FBI.",
    "The search of Bolton’s home and office revealed printed copies of emails labeled 'secret,' 'confidential,' and 'classified,' which prompted further investigation and strengthened the case.",
    "The case is notable for being one of the few where career prosecutors supported the prosecution despite political pressure, unlike cases involving other political adversaries such as James and Comey.",
    "The case demonstrates the intersection of cybersecurity threats, political power dynamics, and the Justice Department’s role in holding former government officials accountable."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "John Bolton, former national security adviser to Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of mishandling classified information after a three-year investigation that began in 2020 and was reactivated following a suspected Iranian cyber-attack on his email accounts in 2021. Prosecutors allege that Bolton shared over a thousand pages of classified information through personal emails with his wife and daughter. The case was initially separated from the earlier probe into his 2020 memoir, but both were merged after the 2021 breach and the subsequent search of his home and office, where sensitive documents labeled 'classified' were found. While career prosecutors supported the case, political pressure from President Trump—despite not mentioning Bolton in his direct calls—played a significant role in shaping the timeline. The indictment, presented to a federal grand jury and approved in late October 2025, marks a key moment in the Justice Department’s efforts to hold political figures accountable. Bolton’s attorney argues the documents were personal diaries shared with immediate family and were known to the FBI. The case illustrates the intersection of cybersecurity threats, political power, and the institutional integrity of federal law enforcement.",
