  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article analyzes the public reaction to President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire deal, which was initially seen as a major foreign policy victory. However, polling data shows that Americans remain largely disenchanted with Trump’s leadership, particularly on economic issues such as inflation, cost of living, and job security. Despite a slight improvement in public approval on the Gaza deal, disapproval rates remain high, and Trump’s overall approval rating has reached a low point in his second term. The article concludes that economic concerns, rather than foreign policy achievements, dominate public sentiment, with Americans placing far greater emphasis on domestic economic stability than on international agreements. This reflects a broader trend where foreign policy is perceived as low-priority, especially compared to issues like inflation and wages.",
