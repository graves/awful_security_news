  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman who was expelled from Congress in 2023 for fraud, identity theft, and misuse of campaign funds. Santos, who admitted to stealing identities of 11 people including family members, had been serving less than three months of a seven-year sentence when released. Trump justified the action by criticizing Senator Richard Blumenthal over claims of fabricated military service, arguing that Santos showed greater moral courage by consistently voting Republican. The case highlights broader political debates over truth, accountability, and executive power, with Santos appealing for a second chance and acknowledging responsibility for his actions. The article also notes that commutations do not erase criminal convictions, and that Trump has previously commuted sentences of other former Republican lawmakers, suggesting a pattern of executive leniency.",
