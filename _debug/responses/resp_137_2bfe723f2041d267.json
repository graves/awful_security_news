This marks a major milestone in Pakistan’s space ambitions, with the satellite expected to enhance national capabilities in precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. The technology allows for detailed detection of material changes on Earth, such as crop health and water resources. The mission supports key national goals, including those of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), by enabling geohazard risk identification. It is part of a broader trend in Pakistan’s space program, which has launched three satellites in 2025, with two (EO-1 and KS-1) already operational. Full functionality of H1 is expected after about two months of calibration, underscoring both national technological advancement and deepening strategic ties with China.",
