    "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing guns, raising questions about whether such a restriction violates the Second Amendment.",

    "The Trump administration defended the law, claiming habitual drug users pose a risk to public safety, particularly during police encounters while impaired.",
    "The government also alleged that Hemani had connections to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and participated in a celebration of Qasem Soleimani’s life, though these claims are not directly tied to drug use or gun possession.",
    "The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a ban must be historically grounded, and only applies to individuals under the influence at the time of arrest, not habitual users.",
    "Hemani’s legal team argued that the historical justification for the law is weak and that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana use, implying a significant overlap between legal marijuana users and gun ownership.",

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, focusing on whether such a restriction violates the Second Amendment. The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual U.S.-Pakistani citizen charged in 2023 with possessing marijuana and cocaine at his home, with prosecutors citing his habitual use. The Trump administration defended the law, claiming habitual drug users pose a public safety risk, including during encounters with police. However, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that such a ban must have historical roots, only applying to those under the influence at arrest, not habitual users. Hemani's legal team countered that the law's historical foundation is weak, especially given that nearly half of U.S. states now allow recreational marijuana use. The case is notable because it includes a similar precedent where Hunter Biden was convicted under the same law and later pardoned by President Joe Biden, highlighting the law’s political and social controversy. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June 2025.",
