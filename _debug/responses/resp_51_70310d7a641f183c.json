Preliminary findings by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) reveal that the cable failed to meet safety specifications set by the operator, CARRIS, and that maintenance records were falsified, with tasks marked as completed even when not performed. Eyewitnesses, including a man named Bruno, described the derailment as sudden and uncontrollable. The investigation highlights systemic failures in cable integrity, maintenance, and safety protocols, raising concerns about infrastructure regulation. A final report is expected next year.",
