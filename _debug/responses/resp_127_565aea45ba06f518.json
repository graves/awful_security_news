  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after the landmark LEAP trial showed that early introduction of peanuts to infants reduces the risk of developing food allergies, new research confirms that real-world implementation has led to a significant decline in peanut allergy rates—by over 27% after 2015 and over 40% after 2017. The study, led by Dr. David Hill at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and published in Pediatrics, analyzed electronic health records and found that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015. This public health shift, rooted in the 2015 LEAP trial by Gideon Lack at King’s College London, which demonstrated over 80% reduction in allergy risk, is now being adopted by parents and medical professionals, despite initial hesitancy. The updated 2021 guidelines recommend introducing allergens like peanuts, peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, and soy-based yogurt between 4 and 6 months of age without prior screening. Experts emphasize that early exposure through small, safe tastes can help prevent allergies, and organizations like FARE support this approach as a critical public health strategy.",
