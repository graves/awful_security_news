  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study reveals that black garden ants (Lasius niger) modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum. When infected, ants exhibit self-isolation and increase distances between high-risk foragers and protective nurses, demonstrating proactive social distancing. Further, the ants build more compartmentalized, less interconnected nests with longer travel routes and spaced entrances, which reduce disease transmission. These changes—both behavioral and structural—work together to form a form of 'architectural immunity'. Researchers Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie found that these adaptations significantly lower the risk of epidemics within colonies. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights a first demonstration of non-human species altering their environment to combat disease. Experts like Sarah Kocher believe these natural strategies could inspire new approaches to human space design, particularly in preventing disease spread in public environments by isolating vulnerable areas and increasing spatial separation.",
