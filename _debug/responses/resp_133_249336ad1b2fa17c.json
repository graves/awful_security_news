  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pope Leo XIV canonized José Gregorio Hernández, Venezuela’s beloved 'doctor of the poor,' in a major ceremony that marked the nation’s first saint and offered a moment of national unity amid deepening economic crisis, political instability, and rising tensions with the United States. Hernández, a 19th-century doctor known for refusing to take money from the poor, was canonized based on widespread veneration rather than a miracle, with Pope Francis approving the decision from his hospital bed in early 2025. The ceremony drew over 70,000 people in St. Peter’s Square, with thousands more celebrating in Caracas via livestream. The event also included the canonization of six other saints from diverse global contexts, such as Papua New Guinea, Armenia, and Ecuador. The timing—just after María Corina Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize—adds symbolic weight to the celebration as a statement of national resilience and cultural pride in the face of external pressure and internal hardship.",
