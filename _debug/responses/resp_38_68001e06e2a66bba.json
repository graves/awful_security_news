  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis is conducting a judicial review of federal law enforcement actions during Operation Midway Blitz, a large-scale ICE deployment in Chicago that resulted in over 1,000 arrests between September and October 2025. The judge has expanded her temporary restraining order to require all federal agents—especially those on the ground—to wear body-worn cameras during protests to ensure transparency. She has questioned officials, including CBP Deputy Kyle Harvick and ICE Deputy Shawn Byers, about training, use of force, and camera compliance, particularly after reports that demonstrators were struck with tear gas and pepper balls without warning. A pastor, Rev. David Black, claimed he was assaulted while praying outside the Broadview detention facility. Meanwhile, federal leadership has been described as unstable, with frequent turnover, such as Russell Hott leaving the Chicago office. The Trump administration has denied reports of unapproved force, and the judge plans to continue deposing senior officials to obtain firsthand accounts of events on the ground.",
