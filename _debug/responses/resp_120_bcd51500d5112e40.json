Elected after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) suffered major electoral losses and lost its majority, Takaichi leads a fragile coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. She emphasizes strengthening Japan’s defense, reinforcing the Japan-U.S. alliance, and asserting a nationalist stance, including regular prayers at the Yasukuni Shrine. Despite being a first in gender representation, her opposition to gender equality, same-sex marriage, and the male-only imperial succession has drawn criticism from LGBTQ+ rights groups. The coalition lacks a majority, raising concerns about political instability and policy implementation. Takaichi is expected to follow the policies of her mentor Shinzo Abe, particularly in defense and economic development. Her upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and diplomatic engagements with China and South Korea highlight the geopolitical importance of Japan in regional and global politics.",
