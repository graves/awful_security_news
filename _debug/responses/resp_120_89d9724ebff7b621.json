  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "SpaceX has settled a lawsuit filed by Cards Against Humanity over claims that the aerospace company trespassed on and damaged private land in Cameron County, Texas, which the game company purchased in 2017 as a protest against President Donald Trump’s border wall proposals. The lawsuit alleged that SpaceX placed construction materials and debris on the land without permission, and that the company admitted to trespassing during the discovery phase. As a result, SpaceX removed construction equipment, and Cards Against Humanity plans to restore the land to its natural state. The company sought $15 million in damages, including for lost vegetation, but acknowledged in its statement that it would likely receive only $2 or nothing from the settlement, given public expectations of returning fan contributions. The settlement was reached just weeks before a jury trial was scheduled to begin on November 3, 2025.",
