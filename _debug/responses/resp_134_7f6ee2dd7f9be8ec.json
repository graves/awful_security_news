  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current global commitments to reduce emissions, the world will still face 57 additional 'superhot days' annually by 2100 — defined as days warmer than 90% of comparable days between 1991 and 2020. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 extra days projected under a pre-Paris 4°C warming scenario. However, the study reveals a stark global inequity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa — which produce only 1% of global emissions — will face massive spikes in dangerous heat, while top carbon emitters such as the United States, China, and India face only 23–30 extra days. Experts warn that this disparity could deepen global inequalities and fuel geopolitical instability, with tens of thousands or millions of people facing health risks from extreme heat annually.",
