  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allows the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a previous lower court block. The decision, which is supported by two Trump-appointed judges, asserts the president’s authority to protect federal personnel amid protests related to immigration policies, while dissenting judge Susan Graber warns of constitutional dangers. The ruling is part of a broader conflict over presidential power, with multiple cities—including Chicago, Memphis, and San Francisco—facing legal and public resistance to federal troop deployments. State leaders and civil rights advocates argue the actions violate constitutional principles, state sovereignty, and civil liberties, while the administration claims it is responding to real threats. The legal battle continues, with both sides preparing for an en banc review of the decision, and senators urging a formal inquiry into the cumulative effects of such deployments on military readiness and civil rights.",
