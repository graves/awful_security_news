  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Australian scientists from CSIRO discovered two new deep-sea species during a 2022 expedition in the Gascoyne Marine Park, 20km off Western Australia's coast. These include the West Australian Lantern Shark, a bioluminescent shark found over 600 meters deep, and a tiny porcelain crab, 1.5cm in size, feeding on plankton using specialized hairs. The findings highlight Australia's rich but underexplored marine biodiversity, with around 20 species now described and an estimated 600 more awaiting formal classification. The discoveries underscore the importance of deep-sea exploration in advancing global scientific knowledge.",
