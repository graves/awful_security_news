  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study led by Joseph Silk at Johns Hopkins University uses supercomputer simulations to show that dark matter could produce a bulge-shaped gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, matching data collected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. While the glow has long been attributed to pulsars, the simulations suggest that dark matter—specifically in an egg-shaped distribution—may explain the observed shape, giving a 50% chance it is dark matter rather than old stars. This finding supports the long-standing hypothesis that dark matter, possibly composed of WIMPs, could be responsible. Although not definitive, the work reinvigorates the search for dark matter, with future observations by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), set to begin in 2027, potentially providing conclusive evidence.",
