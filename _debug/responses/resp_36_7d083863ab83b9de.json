  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite a call from U.S. President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine through heavy use of guided aerial bombs, drones, and missiles. The Ukrainian military reports Russian gains of about 120 square miles over four weeks, with significant drone attacks—over 3,270 drones and 1,370 guided bombs in recent days—targeting both troops and infrastructure. Key battles are ongoing in Kupiansk, Vovchansk, and Pokrovsk, where Russian troops are making territorial claims, though Ukrainian forces have regained some areas. Analysts note improvements in Russian military tactics and equipment, including drone use and command flexibility. However, Russia suffers high casualties—over 950,000 total—and may be shifting to reserve mobilization due to recruitment challenges. Ukraine is countering with long-range strikes on Russian energy infrastructure, disrupting one-fifth of its refining capacity. Despite these efforts, Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no sign of accepting negotiations, and the conflict remains in a stalemate after over 1,300 days.",
