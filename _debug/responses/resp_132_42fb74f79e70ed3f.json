  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A decade after a landmark study by Gideon Lack at King’s College London demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants could prevent life-threatening food allergies, new research shows that this public health intervention has made a measurable impact. Since the 2015 LEAP trial, guidelines recommending early peanut exposure have been adopted, resulting in a 27% to 40% decline in peanut allergy rates among young children. Data from pediatric practices show that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies since 2015, with the most significant decline occurring after expanded guidance in 2017. Despite initial resistance due to confusion, the practice has gained traction, supported by evidence from studies and experts such as Dr. David Hill and FARE. The current recommendation is to introduce allergenic foods like peanut butter, soy-based yogurt, and tree nut butters between 4 and 6 months of age, without prior screening. This shift represents a major advance in preventive medicine and public health, reducing the incidence of one of the most common and dangerous childhood allergies.",
