  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, during which critical online services such as banking apps, social media platforms, airline booking systems, and e-commerce sites became inaccessible for several hours. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented users from reaching data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB service — a key component used by thousands of companies. While AWS is generally reliable, the incident highlights a broader issue: the internet’s extreme dependence on a small number of cloud providers, undermining the original decentralized and resilient design of the internet. Experts, including Rob Jardin and Mike Chapple, note that such disruptions are not only technically possible but also widely impactful due to system interdependence. Past outages, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike software glitch and AT&T’s network failures, show a recurring pattern of fragility in digital infrastructure. The outage underscores the urgent need for redundancy, better system design, and diversified cloud infrastructure to prevent cascading failures.",
