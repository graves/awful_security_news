The ceremony, which drew an estimated 70,000 people and was attended by thousands more watching from Caracas, was approved by the late Pope Francis from his hospital room, bypassing the usual miracle confirmation process due to widespread veneration. The event also included the canonization of six other saints, including Peter To Rot from Papua New Guinea and several religious figures, reinforcing global Catholic unity. The canonization serves as both a spiritual and cultural affirmation of resilience, particularly in the face of years of poverty, emigration, and foreign political pressure.",
