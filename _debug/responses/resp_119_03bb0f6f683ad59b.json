    "Ants, particularly black garden ants (Lasius niger), modify their nest architecture in response to a lethal fungal pathogen (Metarhizium brunneum), reducing disease transmission.",
    "Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase distance from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing.",
    "Nests exposed to the fungus become more compartmentalized, have fewer interconnected tunnels, wider entrances, and longer travel routes, which reduce inter-ant contact and slow disease spread.",
    "The combination of social and architectural changes enhances colony resilience, representing a form of 'architectural immunity'.",
    "This is the first documented case of a non-human social species actively modifying its environment's spatial structure in response to disease threats.",
    "The findings suggest that principles from ant colony design—like isolation of vulnerable members and spatial compartmentalization—can inspire human public space planning to reduce disease spread."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Black garden ants (Lasius niger) respond to a lethal fungal pathogen, Metarhizium brunneum, by altering both their social behavior and nest architecture. Infected ants self-isolate, and healthy ants—especially nurses—increase distance from foragers, demonstrating proactive social distancing. In response to infection, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with reduced tunnel connectivity, wider entrances, and longer travel routes, which reduce disease transmission. This combination of social and structural changes provides a form of 'architectural immunity' that has been observed for the first time in non-human social species. The study, published in Science by researchers Nathalie Stroeymeyt and Luke Leckie, highlights how such natural strategies could inspire human designs of public spaces to reduce disease spread, especially in times of epidemic risk.",
