  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump’s proposed quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin has stalled, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no immediate plans for such a meeting. The change comes after initial optimism following a Thursday phone call, during which Trump and Putin agreed to meet high-level advisors, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. However, officials say the Russian position has not evolved enough and that Lavrov, who is seen as loyal to Putin but not involved in key decisions, cannot meaningfully advance negotiations. A productive phone call between Rubio and Lavrov did not lead to consensus on ending the war or moving forward on a summit, and the Kremlin maintains that no summit can be postponed without a scheduled date. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blames U.S. inaction on long-range missile support for Russia’s reduced diplomatic interest, suggesting that such capabilities are key to achieving peace. While a direct Trump-Putin meeting is no longer on the immediate horizon, low-level diplomatic engagement, possibly at a future ASEAN summit, remains a possibility. The White House continues to affirm Trump’s commitment to peace in Ukraine, and European leaders and Ukraine endorse his call to halt the war at the current battle line.",
