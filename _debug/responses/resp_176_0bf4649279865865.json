  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on October 21, 2025, disrupted critical services across the UK, including Lloyds Bank and HMRC, highlighting the extreme dependence of global digital infrastructure on a small number of US tech firms. With AWS and Microsoft Azure each holding 30–40% of the UK cloud market, and even non-hosted services relying on their underlying infrastructure, the incident revealed a fragile 'nested dependency' that can ripple through economies. Experts warn that reliance on US cloud providers, while cost-effective and scalable, creates systemic risks and vulnerabilities. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Microsoft as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition, while experts and policymakers are calling for stronger data resilience standards, mandatory use of multiple cloud providers, and increased investment in sovereign, diversified cloud ecosystems to reduce national risk and support innovation from domestic providers.",
