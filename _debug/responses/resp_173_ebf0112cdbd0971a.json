  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a major escalation of violence, Russian airstrikes killed at least seven people in Ukraine, including two children, during intense drone and missile attacks on Kharkiv and Kyiv. A kindergarten in Kharkiv was hit, and residents of Kyiv faced widespread power outages and fires. Hours prior, US President Donald Trump canceled a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which the article suggests may have contributed to increased aggression. Ukraine responded by successfully attacking a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk using UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, indicating a shift in the conflict dynamics. President Volodymyr Zelensky attributed the escalation to the lack of US long-range missile support, particularly Tomahawk missiles, which he claims reduced diplomatic leverage. The Kremlin continues to reject ceasefire proposals, underscoring the ongoing and intensifying nature of the conflict.",
