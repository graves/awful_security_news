  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense to return books on race and gender to school libraries on military bases after students claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed due to executive orders from President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. These books covered topics like sexual identity, racism, and LGBTQ+ pride, and the removals led to canceled events, including Black History Month and Holocaust Remembrance Day. The judge ruled that the book removals were not based on educational concerns but on improper partisan motives, emphasizing the need to restore all removed materials. The ACLU filed the legal action on behalf of students, and the decision highlights a broader tension between federal political directives and the free exchange of ideas in public education, particularly in schools serving military families across the U.S. and abroad.",
