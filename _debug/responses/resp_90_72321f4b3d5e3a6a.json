    "The 2025 Michigan business jet crash involves a Hawker 800XP, similar to a crash in February 2024, suggesting a possible systemic issue with stall warning systems in these aircraft.",
    "The plane was registered in Mexico (XA-JMR) and had not flown since March 25, 2024, indicating prolonged inactivity, which may affect aircraft performance or safety systems.",
    "The flight was a test flight after scheduled maintenance by Duncan Aviation, a company that had a close relationship with the aircraft’s owner and crew, amplifying the human and emotional impact.",
    "The pilots requested a block altitude, a maneuver designed to maintain control, but failed to regain control, with controllers unable to reach them seven times.",
    "The crash involved a sudden descent rate of up to 24,000 feet per minute, with a one-minute plunge before impact, indicating a severe aerodynamic stall or loss of control.",
    "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of business jet safety protocols and stall warning system reliability.",
    "Publicly available flight data shows the aircraft climbed to 15,000 feet before descending rapidly, with a final plunge into woods near Lansing, Michigan, killing all three on board."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A private business jet, a Mexican-registered Hawker 800XP with registration XA-JMR, crashed during a test flight near Lansing, Michigan, killing all three on board — two pilots and a maintenance representative. The flight began at Battle Creek Executive Airport at 5:08 p.m. local time, climbing to 15,000 feet before descending rapidly at up to 24,000 feet per minute, culminating in a one-minute plunge into woods. Air traffic control audio captures pilots repeatedly requesting stall recovery, and controllers attempted contact seven times without success. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation. This incident mirrors a similar Hawker 800XP crash in February 2024, during which pilots were testing the aircraft’s stall warning system, raising serious concerns about the reliability of such systems and the risks associated with long periods of inactivity in business jets. Duncan Aviation, which conducted the maintenance, expressed support for affected families and personnel.",
