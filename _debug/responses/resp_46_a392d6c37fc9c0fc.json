  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig in 2023 by poisoning her protein shakes and medications with arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. The case began with Craig’s online research into poisons, including searches for lethal dosages and methods to simulate a heart attack. He ordered arsenic and cyanide through various online suppliers and purchased large quantities of tetrahydrozoline eyedrops. Multiple hospital visits revealed rising toxic levels in Angela’s blood, culminating in her death on March 18, 2023. Evidence from his dental office, including a hidden email account and suspicious purchases, shows a deliberate, premeditated plan. Witnesses, including office staff and business partners, raised concerns and reported the delivery of cyanide, which ultimately led to the prosecution and conviction of Craig for first-degree murder.",
