  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator from Bolivia’s Christian Democratic Party, won the presidential runoff election on October 20, 2025, defeating conservative candidate Jorge 'Tuto' Quiroga with 54.5% of the vote. This victory marks the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule under the Movement to Socialism (MAS), which was led by Evo Morales. The election is driven by Bolivia’s severe economic crisis — including collapsed gas exports, 40-year high inflation, and fuel scarcity — that has led widespread public disillusionment with MAS. Paz’s platform promises private sector-led growth and gradual reform, maintaining social programs while reducing state centralization. Although his party won 49 seats in the lower house and 16 in the Senate, it lacks a majority, requiring coalition-building for governance. His running mate, Edman Lara, boosted his appeal through populist social media activism. Both candidates pledged stronger diplomatic ties with the U.S., with Paz proposing a $1.5 billion fuel cooperation deal. The new administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies and managing opposition from labor unions like COB, which fears social program cuts. The election signals a transformative political shift in Bolivia, with analysts and U.S. officials viewing it as a turning point in both domestic politics and U.S.-Bolivia relations.",
