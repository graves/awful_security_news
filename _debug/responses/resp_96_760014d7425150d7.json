  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump is applying his business-branding expertise to the federal government during his second term, launching initiatives such as TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer drug website, the Trump Gold Card, a proposed Trump coin, a fighter jet named F-47, and a rebranded Rose Garden Club. These efforts, rooted in his experience at the Trump Organization, reflect a strategy of making government services and spaces feel like consumer products, leveraging slogans like 'Make America Great Again' to build a personal and political identity. While such branding increases visibility and public engagement, it has raised concerns about the commodification of government and a shift toward self-promotion, especially given that the U.S. government is not a for-profit entity. Critics argue that this approach violates long-standing norms, despite not breaking laws. The article also notes that Trump’s branding tactics have been amplified by a more agile, media-savvy staff and a faster social media strategy, though this has led to controversy, including AI-generated offensive content. Overall, the article underscores a growing trend in politics where personal identity and branding play a central role in governance, potentially setting a precedent for future administrations.",
