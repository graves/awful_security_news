  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Prosecutors from the Justice Department are challenging Patrick Fitzgerald’s ability to represent former FBI Director James Comey, alleging that Comey used Fitzgerald to disseminate classified information in 2017. Fitzgerald denies these claims, asserting that the memos shared with him were unclassified at the time and that a later upclassification does not negate that fact. The dispute centers on the ethical and legal issue of whether a person can serve as both a witness and a defense attorney in the same case, with legal experts highlighting the inherent conflict of interest. The controversy arises from Comey’s written memos about his interactions with President Trump, which were shared with his attorneys and later subject to classification concerns.",
