  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Human Rights Watch has released a 86-page report alleging that JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is enabling illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas such as Cachoeira Seca and Terra Nossa in Pará state. The investigation reveals a critical gap in JBS’s supply chain: it does not track its indirect suppliers, allowing cattle from illegally deforested land to be moved through a 'laundering' system via animal transit permits (GTAs), which only record group-level data. Pará, where deforestation increased by 421% in 2024 and where illegal land grabs are rampant, is a key region of concern. The state agency Adepará is accused of authorizing livestock transport into protected areas, enabling concealment of illegal origins. JBS previously committed in 2009 to trace all indirect suppliers but failed to meet that deadline. While Brazil has introduced new traceability plans—such as a 2023 decree in Pará and a 2024 federal mandate for full tracking by 2032—advocacy groups warn the timeline is too slow and current systems lack transparency and enforcement. Experts and organizations argue for immediate measures, including public access to GTA data, to hold companies and authorities accountable for deforestation and human rights abuses.",
