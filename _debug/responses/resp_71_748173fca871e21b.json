  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "James Comey, the former FBI Director, has launched a formal legal defense to have federal charges brought against him for allegedly lying during congressional testimony dismissed, arguing that the prosecution is a politically motivated retaliation by President Donald Trump. His attorneys claim that Trump personally targeted Comey due to his public criticism and that the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan—made after the 120-day limit for such appointments expired—violates the U.S. Constitution by circumventing the Senate’s confirmation process. The defense also draws a parallel to a prior case where a federal judge dismissed Trump’s own indictment due to unconstitutional appointment of a special counsel, suggesting that the current prosecution may be legally invalid. These arguments highlight broader concerns about executive overreach, retaliation against political speech, and the constitutional limits on prosecutorial power.",
