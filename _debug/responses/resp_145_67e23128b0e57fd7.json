  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months, despite prior approval in April 2025, due to political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump publicly denounced the plan as a 'global green new scam tax' and threatened sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on supporting nations. The vote, which took place in London on October 17, 2025, saw a resolution passed 57–49, with countries like China, the EU, and Britain maintaining support, while Russia, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Singapore shifted to opposition. The NZF would have implemented a $380 per tonne carbon tax on shipping emissions, aiming to reduce net emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. The move has been criticized by the UN chief and the International Chamber of Shipping as a setback to climate action and industry transition, with Vanuatu calling the delay 'unacceptable' given the urgency of climate change. The article highlights the growing influence of political resistance—particularly from fossil fuel-aligned nations—on global environmental policy.",
