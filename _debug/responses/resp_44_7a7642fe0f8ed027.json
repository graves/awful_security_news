  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amid a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, will run out of funds by early November. Approximately 42 million Americans are at risk of losing critical food assistance, with 17 states halting new applications due to payment system limitations. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins attributes the crisis to political disagreements, blaming Democrats for prioritizing their agenda over food security. The Trump administration has not committed to funding SNAP, unlike its intervention in WIC, which used $300 million in tariff revenue to stay afloat. Despite a $6 billion contingency fund, the $8 billion needed for November benefits cannot be covered. Democrats counter that Republicans are unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes extended Obamacare subsidies. Advocacy groups stress the urgency, especially with Thanksgiving approaching, and call for immediate action to protect vulnerable families from food insecurity.",
