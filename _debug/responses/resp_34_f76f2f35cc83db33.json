  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer based in Astoria, Queens, New York, exemplifies a rare and enduring model of U.S. manufacturing that thrives on skilled craftsmanship, quality, and premium pricing rather than mass production. Despite rising costs and the broader challenges of American manufacturing — including President Trump’s trade tariffs, automation, and labor shortages — Steinway has maintained operations through a focus on domestic sourcing, high-value products, and a consistent workforce of artisans. The company’s production of world-class pianos takes up to 11 months and involves only four to five pianos per day, relying on specialized skills that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. While challenges such as the limited supply of Sitka spruce from Alaska and a shrinking pool of skilled workers remain, the company’s historical continuity and commitment to quality show a viable alternative to traditional, cost-driven manufacturing models. This case suggests that niche, high-value, handcrafted industries may offer a sustainable path for U.S. manufacturing in an era of automation and geopolitical uncertainty.",
