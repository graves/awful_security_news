  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre, a former victim of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' alleging that she was raped and violently beaten by a powerful political figure—described as a 'well-known Prime Minister' in the U.S. version and a 'former minister' in the UK version—widely interpreted as Prince Andrew. The memoir includes claims that Andrew, who is the brother of King Charles, had sexual encounters with Giuffre when she was 17, that Epstein facilitated these encounters, and that Andrew’s team attempted to hire online trolls to harass her during her legal case. Contradictory evidence, including emails from February 2011, suggests Andrew maintained contact with Epstein after claiming to have severed ties in 2010. The publication of the memoir intensifies a transatlantic scandal involving high-profile figures and Epstein, deepening the public disgrace of Prince Andrew, who previously announced he would relinquish his title of Duke of York. This development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing investigation into the connections between powerful individuals and Epstein’s network.",
