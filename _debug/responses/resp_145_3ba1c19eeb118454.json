  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, thousands of residents in Catanduanes, a disaster-prone island in the Philippines, have evacuated due to risks of coastal flooding and strong winds. The storm, expected to pass near the island with gusts up to 80km/h and waves reaching 1.2 meters, is part of a broader pattern of extreme weather events in the country. This comes amid a series of recent natural disasters, including deadly earthquakes in Cebu and southern Philippines and Typhoon Ragasa, which have already strained emergency services. Scientists warn that climate change is making such storms more intense, and Catanduanes has repeatedly been one of the first islands to face cyclones, reinforcing the need for robust disaster preparedness. The situation reflects the Philippines' ongoing struggle with climate and seismic vulnerability, impacting millions of impoverished residents.",
