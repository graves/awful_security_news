  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the impact of a prolonged government shutdown on national parks and local economies, highlighting how visitors continue to access parks despite closures, fee reductions, and staff shortages. While some businesses report minimal losses, others face declining bookings. The absence of park rangers and enforcement leads to increased risks such as illegal drone use, base jumping, and vandalism, raising safety concerns. Advocacy groups urge park closures to protect public safety and preserve park integrity. In Washington, D.C., the shutdown has shifted tourist traffic to private museums, increasing their visitors. Meanwhile, state governments like West Virginia have stepped in to keep key parks open, showing the economic importance of tourism. Environmental degradation, including trash buildup, is also a growing concern, with volunteer efforts underway to clean up. The article underscores a tension between public access and safety, warning of long-term economic and environmental consequences if the shutdown continues.",
