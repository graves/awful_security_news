  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "George Santos, a former Republican congressman from New York, was expelled from Congress in 2023 after a series of fraud and identity theft allegations, including lying about his background, stealing identities of 11 people (including family members), and misusing campaign funds. He served a seven-year prison sentence before President Donald Trump commuted his sentence in October 2025, releasing him immediately. Trump justified the move by criticizing Senator Richard Blumenthal for alleged false claims about his military service, suggesting that Santos at least demonstrated political conviction. Although the commutation does not erase Santos's criminal convictions, it signals a broader political and executive decision to intervene in the punishment of former lawmakers. The case highlights ongoing tensions around accountability, media investigations, and presidential executive power in the U.S. political system.",
