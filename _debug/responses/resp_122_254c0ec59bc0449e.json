  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg introduced new memos requiring Pentagon officials—including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—to obtain prior approval from the Department’s legislative affairs office before engaging with Congress. The policy, which was met with resistance from Pentagon reporters who largely exited the building, is framed by officials as a pragmatic step to improve communication accuracy and transparency. A second memo established a working group to further define legislative engagement guidelines. The move represents a significant shift from prior decentralized communication practices and reflects Hegseth’s broader effort to exert tighter control over the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress and the public.",
