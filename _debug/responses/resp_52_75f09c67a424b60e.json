  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has ended its 50+ year partnership with China by sending three giant pandas—Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji—back to China, marking the conclusion of a long-standing 'panda diplomacy' program. This shift is tied to deteriorating U.S.-China relations, including public controversies over panda treatment and China’s reorientation of diplomatic efforts toward other nations such as Russia and Qatar. The U.S. is now the only country to lose its pandas, with Zoo Atlanta’s contract ending next year and Scotland and Australia set to follow. The pandas are returning to the Chengdu Research Base for conservation, where efforts have helped increase panda numbers. The program’s end reflects a broader trend in which China is shifting its diplomatic outreach, using pandas not as a symbol of U.S.-China friendship, but as a tool for strategic diplomacy elsewhere, signaling a new era of geopolitical tension and realignment in global soft power.",
