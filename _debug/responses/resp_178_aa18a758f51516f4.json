  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The White House is undergoing a major renovation, with parts of its East Wing being demolished to build a new $250 million ballroom as part of President Donald Trump’s vision for a grand presidential space. Despite Trump’s claim that the new structure would only be 'near' the existing building and not interfere with it, demolition has already begun, raising concerns over historical integrity. The project, privately funded by unnamed individuals, bypasses standard National Park Service review processes, which are typically required for such significant changes to a historic structure. Critics, including the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects, have voiced alarm over the lack of transparency, design scrutiny, and long-term impact on the White House’s heritage. While past presidents have modified the building in various ways, this project stands out due to its scale, speed, and the absence of a formal review process, prompting public and professional debate about the balance between presidential ambition and historical preservation.",
