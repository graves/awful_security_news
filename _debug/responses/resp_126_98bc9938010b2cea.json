  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown a positive trend, increasing to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025, up from 376 in 2024, marking a 7% growth over four years after a 25% decline from 2010 to 2020. Scientists attribute this recovery to stronger conservation efforts, including new management measures in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence. Key indicators of improvement include four mother whales producing calves and reduced injury rates. However, only 11 calves were born in 2024, falling short of expectations. Experts remain cautious, emphasizing that sustained efforts are needed to counter ongoing threats such as ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements. Environmental groups stress that weakening the Marine Mammal Protection Act and NOAA’s protections could endanger the species' recovery, highlighting the need for continued political and scientific support.",
