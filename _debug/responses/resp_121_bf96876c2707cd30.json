  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began serving a five-year prison sentence on October 21, 2025, after being convicted of criminal conspiracy to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya, making him the first former head of state in modern French history to be imprisoned. The conviction stems from alleged actions between 2005 and 2007, during which Sarkozy, then interior minister and presidential candidate, used his position to facilitate corruption involving Libyan funds from Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy is currently held in solitary confinement at Paris’ La Santé prison, with limited contact, and has publicly denounced the verdict as a political scandal and a violation of justice. His lawyers have filed an immediate appeal for release, and the appeals court has two months to review the decision. The case has triggered a strong public reaction in France, with supporters expressing outrage and concern over the fairness of the judicial process and the symbolic implications for political accountability. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Sarkozy, acknowledging the human aspect of the situation, while France’s top magistrate Rémy Heitz has warned against political interference in judicial proceedings.",
