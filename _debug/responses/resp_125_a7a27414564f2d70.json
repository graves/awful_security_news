  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has begun demolition of part of the White House East Wing to construct a $250 million, 90,000-square-foot glass-walled ballroom, despite lacking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The project, which will accommodate up to 999 people, is being privately funded by donors and companies such as Carrier Global Corp., which has donated HVAC systems. Trump claims the project is long overdue and necessary to replace the small East Room, which can only host about 200 people. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, will be partially torn down, with offices temporarily relocated. The White House has not disclosed full donor information or submitted plans for review, raising concerns about regulatory compliance and transparency. The project is scheduled for completion before Trump’s term ends in January 2029.",
