    "There is a low but non-zero chance Melissa could impact the U.S. East Coast via rough surf and rip currents, with Florida being a potential secondary impact zone if the storm weakens or changes direction.",
    "Melissa's development is fueled by extremely warm Caribbean waters, which are exacerbated by climate change and contributing to more rapid intensification of storms.",
    "This season has already seen three of four hurricanes undergo extreme rapid intensification, a trend linked to global warming due to fossil fuel pollution.",
    "Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, 2025, though tropical systems can still form after that date."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday, October 25. The storm poses a significant threat to Hispaniola, particularly the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with potential for more than a foot of rainfall, leading to dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. Puerto Rico may experience rainfall. While Melissa’s path remains uncertain, two main scenarios are being monitored: one with a northward turn toward Hispaniola and another with a westward track toward Central America. The storm’s intensification is linked to warmer Caribbean waters, a phenomenon exacerbated by climate change and observed in previous storms like Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto. Although direct U.S. landfall is unlikely, the U.S. East Coast could see rough surf and rip currents, with Florida possibly affected if the storm takes a later northerly turn. The article emphasizes the broader implications of climate change on storm behavior and the potential for late-season hurricanes to impact populated areas.",
