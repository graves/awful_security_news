  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following a week of deadly cross-border clashes along their 2,600km border, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The agreement includes a mutual commitment to stop attacks on each other’s security forces, civilians, and infrastructure, and to refrain from supporting militant groups. Pakistan accuses the Taliban of allowing armed groups like the TTP and BLA to operate from Afghan soil, while the Taliban denies providing safe haven. A follow-up meeting is scheduled in Istanbul on October 25 to ensure the ceasefire’s sustainability and establish monitoring mechanisms. Experts, including Elizabeth Threlkeld of the Stimson Center and political analysts like Abdullah Baheer, question the long-term viability of the truce due to the porous border, the independence of militant groups such as the TTP, and the lack of verified control over cross-border operations. Despite the ceasefire, the underlying tensions over security, territorial sovereignty, and militant infiltration remain unresolved, making the agreement fragile and dependent on sustained diplomatic and operational cooperation.",
