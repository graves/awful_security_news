  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The '6-7' meme, a nonsensical phrase originating from a viral song by Skrilla and popularized by a TikTok gesture from basketball phenom Taylen Kinney, has spread rapidly through Gen Alpha students in schools across the U.S. Though the phrase has no clear meaning, it functions as a social shibboleth — a signal of belonging to a peer group — and has become disruptive in classrooms. Teachers report hearing it 75 times in a day, leading to bans and creative counter-memes. Experts suggest its longevity is due to the strong emotional reaction from adults and the nature of youth-driven language, which evolves organically without a fixed meaning. While some worry about declining literacy, scholars argue that such trends are normal and reflect broader shifts toward post-truth communication. The meme may soon be replaced by new slang like '41,' indicating a natural cycle of internet culture, but its cultural significance in illustrating youth identity and peer dynamics remains notable.",
