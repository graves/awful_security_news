  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, beginning around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and resolving by 6 p.m. Eastern time. The root cause was traced to a failure in AWS's domain name system (DNS), which disrupted access to a wide range of online services, including social media (Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and education tools (Canvas). The outage affected users of Amazon’s own services like Ring and Alexa, and led to academic disruptions at universities such as Ohio State and the University of California, Riverside. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages are typical of a world increasingly dependent on a few major cloud providers, with recovery processes being slow and bumpy but generally manageable within hours. This event underscores the fragility of modern digital infrastructure, where a failure in one core service can cascade across countless other platforms, affecting individuals, businesses, and institutions worldwide.",
