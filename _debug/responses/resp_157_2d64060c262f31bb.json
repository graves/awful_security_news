  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Peru’s Interim President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital, Lima, to manage widespread protests driven by Gen-Z activists demanding accountability for corruption and organized crime. These protests have escalated into violence, resulting in one death and over 100 injuries. The emergency grants the government the authority to deploy the military and restrict fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly, raising concerns over civil liberties. The decision follows the removal of former President Dina Boluarte, who was impeached for failing to address a growing crime wave, including a 30% rise in extortion cases and 1,690 homicides between January and September 2025. Despite previous emergency measures under Boluarte in March, crime has not decreased, and the current decree lacks details on how intelligence will be used to combat extortion, highlighting governance gaps.",
