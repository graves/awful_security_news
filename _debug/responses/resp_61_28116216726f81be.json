  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A federal appeals court panel is evaluating the legitimacy of Alina Habba’s appointment as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, which bypassed the standard Senate confirmation process required by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The Justice Department asserts that delegation of authority by the Attorney General allows temporary or permanent service, citing precedent from other federal roles and noting that 16 US attorneys were recently confirmed. However, opponents argue that full US Attorney powers — including oversight of investigations and personnel — cannot be delegated, calling the process 'gerry-rigged' and unprecedented. The case has drawn parallels to similar challenges in Nevada and California, and broader political tensions are evident, including Habba’s claim that congressional obstruction has forced executive action. The legal outcome could set a precedent for future US attorney appointments and influence the balance of power between executive appointments and legislative oversight.",
