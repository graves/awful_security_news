  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Mexico experienced deadly flooding from heavy rainfall caused by multiple tropical storms, including Tropical Storm Raymond, Priscilla, and remnants of Cyclone Octave, affecting central and southeastern regions. At least 37 people died, with the highest tolls in Hidalgo (22), Puebla (9), and Veracruz (5), and over 80,000 people affected. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range was particularly vulnerable due to landslides and blocked communities. Authorities responded with over 8,700 military personnel and extensive navy support, including emergency shelters, medical supplies, and transportation. A broader climate context, including the return of La Nina, may have intensified rainfall patterns, while a record-breaking rainfall event in Mexico City suggests worsening climate trends. The situation underscores the growing vulnerability of Mexican communities to extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.",
