  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a significant cloud computing outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, originating from a domain name system (DNS) issue in its US-EAST-1 region. The outage disrupted access to a wide range of online services, including social media platforms (Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite), financial apps (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming services (Netflix, Disney+), and educational platforms like Canvas. Users of Amazon’s own products, such as Ring and Alexa, also reported failures. The disruption affected students and educators globally, with universities like the University of California, Riverside and Ohio State University reporting inability to deliver online course materials. While AWS reported recovery by 6 p.m. Eastern time, the event underscored the critical dependence of modern internet infrastructure on a few dominant technology providers. Experts like Mike Chapple and Patrick Burgess noted that such outages, though disruptive, are typically not the result of cyberattacks and are resolved within hours through standard technical recovery processes. This incident is part of a broader pattern of AWS outages, including those in 2017, 2020, and 2023, highlighting recurring vulnerabilities in cloud-based systems.",
