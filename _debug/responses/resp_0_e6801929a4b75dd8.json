  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Misty Copeland, the first Black woman principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, is retiring after a decades-long career marked by both artistic excellence and groundbreaking advocacy for racial and gender inclusivity in ballet. Her rise challenged long-standing norms in a historically white, uniformed industry, inspiring a new generation of Black ballerinas. Though progress has been made—such as India Bradley becoming the first Black woman soloist at New York City Ballet—systemic gaps remain, with few Black women in top ranks at major companies. Copeland’s legacy includes not only her performances in classics like 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Sinatra Suite' but also her activism, including the 'Let’s Make a Pointe!' petition to diversify digital representation. A star-studded farewell gala will honor her contributions, featuring tributes from Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen, and free live simulcasts to ensure accessibility.",
