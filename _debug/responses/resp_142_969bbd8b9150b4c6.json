  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "China has tightened its export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, adding five new ones — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium — to a previous list of seven. The restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce and effective from December 1, 2025, target both the metals and the specialized equipment used to refine them. Foreign companies must obtain special approvals detailing the intended use of products containing rare-earth metals, especially those with at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth content. China justifies the move on grounds of national security, citing unauthorized transfers of controlled materials to military or sensitive applications. The announcement comes just weeks before a high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, positioning the controls as a strategic signal to strengthen China’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. As the US is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products and relies on them for critical defence systems and consumer technology, the restrictions are seen as a major threat to US industrial and military capabilities. Analysts, including from CSIS and the University of Montana, interpret the move as part of 'pre-meeting choreography' to pressure US policymakers, while China emphasizes openness to dialogue on export controls and supply chain stability.",
