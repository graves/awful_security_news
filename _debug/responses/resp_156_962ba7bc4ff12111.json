  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like heavy rainfall or roaring sounds and using traditional signals like gunfire—is being relied upon to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially when official early warning systems fail. Despite a $37 million GLOF-II project launched in 2017, many systems remain non-operational due to lack of trust, poor maintenance, and lack of communication with rescue teams. Community members like shepherds Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain have demonstrated that timely human-based alerts can save lives without casualties, even during major floods. This highlights a critical gap: while technology is being deployed, it lacks community trust and real-time integration. Pakistan, ranked among the top 10 climate-vulnerable nations, faces increasing glacial melt and flooding due to rising temperatures—1.3°C since 1950s—making Indigenous knowledge a vital, resilient alternative to underperforming technological systems.",
