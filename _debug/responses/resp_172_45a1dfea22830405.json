  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A £28 million timeshare fraud targeting over 3,500 elderly victims—mostly aged 60 to 80—was uncovered through secret filming by BBC Scotland Investigates in 2016. The company Sell My Timeshare (SMT) deceived victims by promoting a fake 'Monster Rewards' system that promised financial freedom and contract exit, but instead led them to pay large upfront fees for worthless credits. The fraud, which relied on high-pressure sales tactics and a 'bait-and-switch' model, went undetected for nearly a decade. After the BBC broadcast its investigation, police launched an inquiry, and over the next nine years, 14 individuals were convicted, including Mark Rowe, who received a seven-and-a-half year sentence, and his wife Nicola, who received a two-year suspended sentence for money laundering. The case underscores the importance of investigative journalism in holding fraudulent companies accountable and demonstrates how vulnerable elderly individuals can be exploited through complex financial schemes. The Crown Prosecution Service will now pursue recovery of stolen funds.",
