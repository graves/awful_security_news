  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef that combines marine science and art to restore a historically lost coral reef ecosystem. Led by coral expert Colin Foord and artistic director Ximena Caminos, the project features underwater sculptures—such as 22 concrete cars—designed to host resilient soft corals that will grow over time, transforming the structures into vibrant, living reefs. The initiative, funded by a $5 million city bond and seeking an additional $6 million, aims to revitalize marine biodiversity, promote ecotourism, and provide public access to underwater environments. The reef will be accessible to swimmers in just 15 to 20 feet of water, 700 feet off the beach, and includes an onshore education center to teach about coral reef conservation. The project reflects a broader mission of cultural placemaking, drawing from Ximena Caminos' experience in urban revitalization in Buenos Aires, and could one day feature 57 giant starfish as a symbol of Miami Beach’s ecological rebirth.",
