  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, which have advanced research into cancer and autoimmune diseases. The full announcement schedule spans from October 6 to October 13, covering medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and economics. The prizes, established by Alfred Nobel’s will, are awarded by specialized institutions and recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to humanity. The 2024 winners in science and literature demonstrate the impact of foundational research, including AI-driven protein prediction and literary exploration of trauma. Notably, the peace prize has become a focal point of political debate due to claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that he deserves the award for ending wars, despite experts noting that such claims do not align with the prize's focus on durable peace and institutional work. The Nobel committees emphasize scientific rigor and independence, with concerns raised about political interference, particularly from the Trump administration, which has been criticized for threatening academic freedom. These events underscore the Nobel Prizes’ global significance as both scientific and cultural milestones.",
