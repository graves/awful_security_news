  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major global outage on Monday, October 20, 2025, lasting several hours and affecting numerous online services such as banking, social media, e-commerce, and airline booking. The root cause was a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented websites and apps from accessing data stored in AWS’s DynamoDB service. Despite no evidence of a cyberattack, the incident highlights the fragility of the internet’s infrastructure due to overreliance on a few centralized cloud providers. Experts warn that without better redundancies and competitive cloud options, such outages will continue to have widespread consequences, reinforcing the need for more resilient and decentralized digital systems.",
