  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking for authorization to deploy the National Guard in Chicago amid claims of a violent, pre-planned ambush threatening federal personnel. The administration asserts that lower courts, including the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, have improperly blocked the deployment by overstepping presidential authority, citing the 1827 case Martin v. Mott as precedent. In contrast, Judge April Perry described the protests as peaceful dissent, and opponents argue that the deployment exceeds a 'range of honest judgment' based on the 1932 case Sterling v. Constantin. The Supreme Court has previously supported Trump in similar emergency actions and is now expected to act quickly, requesting responses from state and local officials by Monday evening. This case centers on the constitutional balance between presidential emergency powers and judicial oversight in domestic security decisions.",
