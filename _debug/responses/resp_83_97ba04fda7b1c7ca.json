    "Workers may have to repay employers for benefits like signing or retention bonuses, tuition reimbursement, or on-the-job training if they leave before a specified stay period, under so-called 'stay-or-pay' agreements.",
    "Such agreements are often criticized as abusive, particularly when applied to lower-income workers, and are sometimes referred to as 'TRAPs' (Training Repayment Agreements that are Predatory).",
    "California has passed a first-in-the-nation law banning repayment for on-the-job training (except in approved apprenticeship programs) and for benefits when workers are laid off without cause or when jobs are eliminated.",
    "The law allows limited stay-or-pay provisions such as signing bonuses, tuition reimbursement for transferable credentials, and retention bonuses â€” but only if prorated and with employee choice to take bonuses at departure.",
    "The stay period is capped at two years, and interest accrual is prohibited, reducing financial risk for employees.",
    "The law aims to prevent employer-induced employee indenture, protect worker mobility, and ensure fair labor practices in industries like healthcare, retail, and transportation.",
    "Other states like New York are also considering similar legislation, indicating a potential national movement against restrictive stay-or-pay agreements."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses how some employers require employees to repay benefits like on-the-job training or tuition reimbursement if they leave before a set period, under so-called 'stay-or-pay' agreements. These agreements, especially called TRAPs, are seen as abusive and limiting worker mobility, particularly for lower-income workers in industries like healthcare, retail, and transportation. A new law in California, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, bans repayment for training (except in approved apprenticeships) and for benefits when jobs are eliminated, while allowing limited provisions like prorated bonuses and tuition for transferable credentials. The law caps the stay period at two years and prohibits interest. The move is praised by labor advocates and unions as a step toward fairer labor practices, with potential ripple effects across other U.S. states as similar legislation is considered.",
