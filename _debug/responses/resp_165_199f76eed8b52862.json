  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, communities are increasingly relying on Indigenous knowledge—such as observing natural signs like sudden rainfall, animal behavior, and specific sound patterns—to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Despite significant investments in government early warning systems (EWS), such as the $37 million GLOF-II project, these systems suffer from frequent malfunctions, lack of community trust, and poor follow-up, leading residents to turn to local shepherds and elders for warnings. Real-life examples, like that of Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain, demonstrate how timely human-based alerts have successfully prevented loss of life. The article underscores that while technology is important, it must be integrated with traditional knowledge and community trust to be effective. Given Pakistan’s status as one of the most climate-vulnerable nations despite low emissions, and rising temperatures since the 1950s, the reliance on Indigenous knowledge offers a culturally grounded, resilient, and effective alternative to technologically failed systems.",
