Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks narrowly defeated the Houston Texans 27-19, with wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba leading the league in receiving yards (819) and recording eight catches for 123 yards and a touchdown. However, a major storyline was the serious injury of Tampa Bay’s star wide receiver Mike Evans, who suffered a broken clavicle after a fall during the game, ending his season and breaking his 11-year streak of 1,000+ receiving yards annually. The article highlights both offensive breakout performances and significant injuries that reshape team dynamics and season trajectories.",
