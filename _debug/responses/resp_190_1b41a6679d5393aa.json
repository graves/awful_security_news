  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Following Prince Andrew’s loss of his Duke of York title due to his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former wife Sarah Ferguson has lost her duchess title and will now be known as Sarah Ferguson. The scandal intensified after a 2011 email revealed she referred to Epstein as her 'supreme friend,' prompting charities to drop her as a patron. Though Sarah has maintained public presence and resilience, including attending royal events, her business and charitable ventures are now under scrutiny. The daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, retain their princess titles and are in the royal line of succession, though their official roles remain minimal and unlikely to expand. The article highlights how the scandal disproportionately affects Prince Andrew and Sarah, while the daughters are seen as largely unaffected, maintaining their dignity and public affection despite the family turmoil.",
