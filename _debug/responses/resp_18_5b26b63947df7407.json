  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Veterans, particularly those with chronic conditions like PTSD, are being abruptly cut off from long-term one-on-one therapy sessions at VA facilities, despite medical evidence that such care is essential. The policy, introduced under former VA Secretary Doug Collins in 2021 and intensified since then, mandates a fixed number of therapy sessions (typically 4–24), often ending care prematurely without patient or provider input. Providers report facing disciplinary action for extending sessions, some have resigned in protest, and veterans describe the experience as re-traumatizing and abandonment. While the VA claims there are no limits and that care should be patient-centered, internal reports and expert opinion — including from the American Psychological Association — indicate that the policy undermines recovery, trust, and clinical appropriateness. Veterans with severe or lifelong conditions argue that therapy must be continuous, akin to managing chronic physical illnesses like diabetes. The article raises urgent concerns about the quality, equity, and long-term effectiveness of mental health care for veterans in the U.S. VA system.",
