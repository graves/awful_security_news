  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A landmark study conducted by King's College London and the University of Oxford has ranked antidepressants based on their physical side effects—such as weight gain, heart rate changes, and blood pressure fluctuations—revealing significant differences between drugs. The research analyzed over 58,000 patients across 30 common antidepressants and found that even within the widely prescribed SSRI class, side effects vary substantially. For instance, fluoxetine is linked to weight loss and elevated blood pressure, while venlafaxine and amitriptyline increase weight and blood pressure. Patients with specific health conditions—like high blood pressure or high cholesterol—should be prescribed drugs tailored to their needs, such as citalopram or escitalopram. The researchers emphasize that while no antidepressant is universally 'better,' individualized treatment improves patient outcomes and long-term health. A free online tool is being developed to help doctors and patients make informed decisions. The findings challenge the current UK trend of prescribing 85% of antidepressants to just three SSRIs, suggesting that personalized prescriptions could improve patient safety and health outcomes, especially in long-term depression treatment.",
