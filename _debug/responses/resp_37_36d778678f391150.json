  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which remains a beloved romantic classic 30 years after its release. Centered on a love story between two young Indians raised abroad who must navigate family expectations, the film captured the nation’s post-liberalization aspirations and anxieties. Directed by Aditya Chopra, DDLJ broke new ground by portraying Indians living overseas as protagonists, influencing a generation of future films such as 'Pardes,' 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,' and 'Kal Ho Naa Ho.' The film elevated Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol into iconic on-screen partners, and its music, costumes, and narrative style resonated deeply with audiences. Today, DDLJ is still screened daily at the Maratha Mandir in Mumbai, a testament to its lasting legacy. While some critics note dated gender politics and limited female agency, the film’s emotional authenticity and cultural resonance continue to make it a touchstone for Indian audiences, especially those seeking romance, nostalgia, and a reflection of national identity.",
