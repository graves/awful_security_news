  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, which was seen as a major foreign policy achievement, American public opinion has shown little enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s handling of the situation. Polls from AP-NORC and CNBC reveal that Trump’s approval ratings remain at or below their lowest levels, especially on domestic economic issues, with 62% disapproving of his inflation and cost-of-living policies. The article argues that economic concerns, such as inflation, job insecurity, and stagnant wage growth, dominate public sentiment, overshadowing the international significance of the Gaza deal. Even though some believe the ceasefire could bolster Trump’s legitimacy or even earn him a Nobel Peace Prize, Americans prioritize economic stability over foreign policy outcomes. The article concludes that the true driver of public opinion is the economy — not international diplomacy — and that the Gaza deal, while notable globally, has had minimal impact on Trump’s domestic popularity.",
