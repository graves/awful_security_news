  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes to avoid coastal flooding and strong winds. The storm is forecast to pass near the island with gusts up to 80km/h and waves up to 1.2 meters, posing a minimal to moderate flood risk. This evacuation is part of a regular drill, as Catanduanes is frequently the first landmass affected by western Pacific cyclones. The Philippines faces an average of 20 typhoons annually, and climate scientists attribute increasing storm intensity to global warming. The country is still recovering from a series of recent disasters, including deadly earthquakes in Cebu and the southern coast, and Typhoon Ragasa in September, highlighting its ongoing vulnerability to extreme weather events.",
