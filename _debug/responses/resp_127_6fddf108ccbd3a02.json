  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in over 20 years, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in the 2025 presidential runoff, ending decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism party. His campaign emphasized a return to economic realism, including rejecting a proposed IMF bailout and pledging to restore foreign relations with the United States, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it a 'transformative opportunity.' Paz also broke from past alliances with Venezuela by reaching out to opposition leader María Corina Machado. To address Bolivia’s severe economic crisis — including a 23% inflation rate and fuel shortages — Paz plans to cut subsidies, target financial aid to poor families through direct transfers, and secure $3.5 billion in loans and an additional $600 million within 60 days. Critics warn that reforms may face resistance, especially given the country’s deep-rooted distrust of political institutions and past electoral fraud, such as in Evo Morales’ 2019 re-election. Protests erupted in La Paz and Santa Cruz, with supporters of the losing candidate, Jorge Quiroga, calling the election 'fraud.' The new leadership faces the challenge of balancing economic recovery with political stability and respect for Bolivia’s Indigenous majority, which gained significant representation under Morales.",
