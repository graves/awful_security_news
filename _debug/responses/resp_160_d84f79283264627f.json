  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Taiwan’s Kuomintang (KMT) has elected Cheng Li-wun as its new leader, marking a shift toward peace and reduced defence spending, in contrast to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) military posture and U.S. support. Cheng, a reformist former DPP member, defeated establishment candidate Hau Lung-bin and rejected increased defence budgets, emphasizing regional stability and avoiding Taiwan as a geopolitical pawn. With the KMT and Taiwan People’s Party now holding a legislative majority, the new leadership poses significant political pressure on the DPP to pass legislation and budget proposals. The election has also drawn accusations of Chinese interference, with the National Security Bureau identifying foreign-linked social media content, though both Beijing and Cheng have downplayed such claims. This development signals a pivotal moment in cross-strait relations and Taiwan’s domestic political dynamics.",
