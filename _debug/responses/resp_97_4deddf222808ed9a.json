  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and long-range weapon with a history of use in conflicts from Iraq to Syria, is being considered by Ukraine as a strategic tool to strike deep into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged the US, particularly under the Trump administration, to supply Tomahawks to target critical Russian infrastructure such as the Shahed drone factory in Tatarstan and Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov. However, the US has stated it has few missiles available and needs them for domestic defense. Additionally, Ukraine lacks the necessary ground-launched Typhon system to deploy Tomahawks, and its own Flamingo missile program is underdeveloped. Russia has responded with alarm, viewing such a supply as a hostile act that could threaten global security and spark escalation, especially due to the Tomahawk’s potential nuclear capability. While the Tomahawk could inflict significant damage, Ukraine's immediate military needs remain focused on enhancing air defenses against Russian drone and missile attacks.",
