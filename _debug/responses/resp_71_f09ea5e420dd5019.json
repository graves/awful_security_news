  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former FBI Director James Comey has launched a legal defense against federal charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, arguing that the prosecution is politically motivated and retaliatory, driven by President Donald Trump’s personal vendetta against him. His attorneys claim that Trump’s public attacks on Comey and the appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan—beyond the 120-day interim limit and without Senate confirmation—constitute a constitutional violation and an abuse of power. They also draw a parallel to the earlier dismissal of Trump’s own case by a federal judge, citing that as precedent for the unlawful nature of Halligan’s appointment. The case raises significant constitutional and political questions about prosecutorial independence, retaliation, and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.",
