    "A Kremlin envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, proposed a 112-kilometre undersea tunnel between Siberia and Alaska to link Russia and the United States, suggesting it could be built with Elon Musk's The Boring Company.",
    "The project is described as a 'railroad and cargo link' that would enable joint resource exploration, particularly in the Arctic hydrocarbon sector.",
    "US President Donald Trump expressed interest in the proposal during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though Zelenskyy stated he was 'not happy with this idea'.",
    "Dmitriev suggested expanding joint hydrocarbon projects among Russia, China, and the US in the Arctic due to climate change-driven ice melt.",
    "The proposal references a historical Cold War idea — the 'Kennedy-Khrushchev World Peace Bridge' — and frames the new tunnel as a symbol of unity between the US and Russia.",
    "The Bering Strait, which is 82km wide at its narrowest point, is the geographical barrier between Russia’s Chukotka and Alaska, with the Diomede Islands only 4km apart.",
    "Dmitriev posted a sketch of the proposed tunnel route and tagged Elon Musk, suggesting The Boring Company's involvement and estimating the project cost at less than $8 billion.",
    "Musk has not publicly responded to the proposal as of the article's publication date.",
    "The project is positioned as a bold step toward continental connection, with Dmitriev claiming it represents a 'new era of unity' between Eurasia and the Americas."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Kremlin investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev has proposed a controversial undersea tunnel linking Russia’s Siberia to Alaska, suggesting it could be constructed with Elon Musk’s The Boring Company at a cost under $8 billion. The project, dubbed the 'Putin-Trump Tunnel,' is framed as a symbol of unity between the US and Russia and would enable joint exploration of Arctic hydrocarbons. While US President Donald Trump expressed interest in the idea during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who responded negatively, the proposal draws on a Cold War-era vision of a 'Kennedy–Khrushchev World Peace Bridge' and reflects broader geopolitical interest in Arctic resource development amid climate change. Dmitriev has publicly promoted the plan, including a sketch of the route and a direct post to Musk, but as of the article’s publication, Musk has not responded. The proposal remains speculative, politically sensitive, and faces significant logistical, environmental, and diplomatic hurdles.",
