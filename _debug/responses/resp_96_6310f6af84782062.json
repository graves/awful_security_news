  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The U.S. military conducted a seventh strike on a vessel believed to be affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and carrying substantial narcotics, killing all three individuals on board. This action reflects the Trump administration’s hardline stance against drug trafficking, including authorizing lethal strikes on suspected traffickers without due process and expanding military operations in South America. The move has drawn criticism from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the U.S. of killing an innocent national, leading to a diplomatic dispute and the cancellation of U.S. aid. The administration’s classified legal opinion, which may allow the designation of drug traffickers as enemy combatants and their summary execution, has raised serious constitutional and ethical concerns. Bipartisan senators, including Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, have voiced alarm, warning that such actions undermine democratic principles and due process.",
