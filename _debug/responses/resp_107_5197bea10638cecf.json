However, software engineers such as Colton Voege and Simon Willison express skepticism, noting that AI-generated code often fails in complex tasks, creates unworkable or 'death spiral' outputs, and requires human review and oversight. Studies show mixed results, with some engineers gaining modest time savings (e.g., 6.5% in Denmark) while others report longer task completion times. AI tools are most effective for quick prototypes and repetitive tasks, not for higher-level problem-solving. The industry faces concerns about job displacement for junior engineers, environmental costs, and misuse — such as the 'workslop' phenomenon — where AI is used without justification, resulting in messy, unreviewable code. Despite bold claims, experts agree that human engineers remain essential to code quality, safety, and long-term software success.",
