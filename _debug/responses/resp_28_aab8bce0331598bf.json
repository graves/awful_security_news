  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A government shutdown has led to the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees, resulting in limited staffing and safety risks in national parks like Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and New River Gorge. While some parks remain open with state or private funding, the absence of rangers has led to increased illegal activities such as drone flights and base jumping, and has raised concerns about trash accumulation and vandalism. Local businesses report mixed outcomes—some see increased demand due to free access, while others face revenue losses. In Washington, D.C., closures of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo have redirected tourist traffic to private museums, with Mount Vernon seeing a 50% visitor increase. Advocacy groups warn of long-term impacts on safety, visitor experience, and local economies, urging park closures to protect public welfare. The situation underscores the economic and environmental vulnerabilities tied to national park operations during political gridlock.",
