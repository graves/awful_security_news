  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A man named Ian Cleary, who sexually assaulted a woman at Gettysburg College in 2013, was sentenced to two to four years in prison in October 2025 after being extradited from France following a long and difficult pursuit. The assault, which went nearly undetected for over a decade, prompted victim Shannon Keeler to renew her efforts in 2019 after receiving a Facebook message from Cleary stating 'So I raped you.' Despite prosecutors' initial reluctance to act in campus sexual assault cases, Keeler's public advocacy and the 2021 Associated Press story helped revive the case. Cleary, who had lived in Silicon Valley and worked at Tesla, was tracked down through an unrelated arrest in Metz, France, in April 2024. The judge, Senior Judge Kevin Hess, considered Cleary’s guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness when sentencing him, resulting in a term below state guidelines. The case underscores broader issues in the justice system, including delayed prosecution, destroyed evidence, and the long-term trauma inflicted on victims.",
