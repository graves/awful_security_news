  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale population has shown a positive trend, increasing to an estimated 384 individuals in 2025 from 376 in 2024, marking a 7% rise after a decade of decline. Scientists attribute this recovery to reduced injuries and mortalities, improved reproductive success—such as four mothers having calves and shorter birth intervals—along with new conservation measures in Canada. While still vulnerable due to threats like ship strikes and fishing gear, the population’s slow growth offers cautious optimism. Experts emphasize the need for sustained protection, particularly under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and warn that policy rollbacks could endanger the species’ recovery.",
