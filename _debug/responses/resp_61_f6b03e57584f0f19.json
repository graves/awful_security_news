    "The mysterious gamma-ray glow at the center of the Milky Way, detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008, has been a subject of debate among astronomers.",
    "Two main theories exist: the glow could be from pulsars (remnants of exploded stars), or from dark matter collisions, particularly involving WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).",
    "New simulations using supercomputers show that dark matter in the galactic center could be squashed into an egg-shaped distribution, matching the observed bulge-shaped glow — a key point in favor of the dark matter theory.",
    "The shape of dark matter distribution, previously assumed to be spherical, is now shown to be flattened or 'squashed', aligning better with Fermi telescope data.",
    "If confirmed by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), starting in 2027, the glow could be direct evidence of dark matter annihilation, a major breakthrough in physics.",
    "Despite no direct detection of dark matter to date, the idea that WIMPs could explain the glow remains a compelling and elegant solution to one of the century’s greatest scientific mysteries."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Scientists have long debated the origin of a mysterious, diffuse gamma-ray glow detected at the center of the Milky Way by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope since 2008. The glow, shaped like the galactic bulge, was initially thought to originate from pulsars — remnants of exploded stars — but new supercomputer simulations by Joseph Silk and colleagues now suggest that dark matter, specifically WIMPs, could explain it. The simulations reveal that dark matter in the galactic center is not uniformly spherical but instead squashed into an egg-shaped form, matching the observed glow. This finding supports a dark matter explanation, though it does not provide definitive proof. A future instrument, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expected to begin operations in 2027, will offer higher-resolution gamma-ray data to confirm or rule out the dark matter hypothesis. If confirmed, this would be a landmark discovery in physics, offering direct evidence of dark matter and solving one of the century’s greatest scientific mysteries.",
