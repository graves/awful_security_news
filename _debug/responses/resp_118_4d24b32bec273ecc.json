  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef designed to restore a historic coral habitat lost in the 1970s. The project combines art and science, with artists like Ximena Caminos and Leandro Ehrlich creating underwater sculptures from marine-grade concrete — including 22 cars — that will be colonized by resilient, locally sourced gorgonian corals. Scientists like Colin Foord cultivate and transplant these corals in a nursery, with the hope that over time, the sculptures will become part of a living, vibrant reef. The project is funded by a $5 million city bond and seeks an additional $6 million. It aims to become an ecotourism destination, educational center, and cultural symbol, with a potential future phase featuring 57 giant sculpted starfish. Reefline represents a bold fusion of environmental restoration and artistic innovation.",
