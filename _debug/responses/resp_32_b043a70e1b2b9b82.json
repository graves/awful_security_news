The flight departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. local time and turned around just 18 minutes later. The Federal Aviation Administration determined that a malfunction in the inter-phone system — specifically a flight crew mic — caused the loss of communication.

The flight eventually resumed for Los Angeles nearly five hours late, causing the Gruver family to miss their connection to Japan and wait overnight.
