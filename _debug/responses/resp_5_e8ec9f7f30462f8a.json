  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Misty Copeland, the first Black woman principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre and a trailblazer for racial inclusion in classical ballet, is retiring after a decades-long career. Her journey—marked by overcoming racial and gender barriers, rising from corps de ballet to principal, and becoming a cultural icon—has inspired a new generation of diverse ballerinas. The farewell gala features tributes from Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen, and a performance of excerpts from 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Sinatra Suite,' as well as a new piece by Kyle Abraham. Copeland’s advocacy, including her 'Let’s Make a Pointe!' petition and foundation work, has pushed ballet toward greater inclusivity in both performance and digital representation. While progress has been made—such as India Bradley becoming the first Black woman soloist at New York City Ballet—the lack of diversity in top ranks at major institutions like ABT and Paris Opera shows that systemic change remains ongoing.",
