The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, follows a 2015 lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed Andrew was aware of her underage status and participated in sexual abuse. Though he denies all allegations, the scandals led to the stripping of his military titles and charity positions. Prince Andrew will no longer attend royal events or use his titles, but will retain his designation as 'Prince' due to his lineage. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson will now be known only as Sarah Ferguson, while his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, remain unaffected. The controversy has intensified with Giuffre’s death in 2025 and the release of her posthumous memoir, which is expected to further expose the details of the allegations.",
