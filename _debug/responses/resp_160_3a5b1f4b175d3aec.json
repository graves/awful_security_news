  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that global warming, driven by human activity, will result in an additional 57 superhot days per year by 2100—nearly two months of dangerous heat—thanks to current climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. This represents a significant reduction from the 114 superhot days predicted in a worst-case scenario without the agreement. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 average superhot days. The study reveals a stark global disparity: small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa, which produce negligible emissions, are expected to face the largest spikes in heat, with Panama projected to gain 149 extra days annually. In contrast, top polluters such as the U.S., China, and India, which account for 42% of global CO2, face only 23–30 additional days. Experts warn that this imbalance not only reflects climate injustice but may also contribute to geopolitical tensions, as vulnerable nations bear the brunt of warming while emitters remain largely insulated from its impacts.",
