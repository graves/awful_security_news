  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education' approached, nine institutions—including MIT, Brown, Penn, USC, UVA, and Dartmouth—rejected the agreement. The Compact, which mandates gender-based restroom and sports policies, tuition freezes, limited international enrollment, and standardized testing, was criticized by schools for undermining academic integrity, research merit, and diversity. Despite a White House virtual meeting with key institutions, including UVA and Dartmouth, no binding agreement was reached. The widespread dissent reflects a broader conflict between federal political mandates and academic independence, especially regarding DEI policies and research funding, which has already seen billions in federal grants canceled under the Trump administration.",
