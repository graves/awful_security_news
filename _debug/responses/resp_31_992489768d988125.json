  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article reports on the current U.S. government shutdown, which is a full shutdown due to the failure to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills. It notes that this marks a continuation of political stalemate, with the current Congress unable to reach agreement despite narrow majorities and Senate filibuster rules. It references the longest shutdown in history—35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019—which cost the economy an estimated $3 billion and affected around 800,000 federal workers, with 300,000 furloughed. Unlike the partial 2018 shutdown, the current shutdown affects all federal operations. The article attributes the ongoing impasse to partisan gridlock, particularly the narrow House majority under Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate’s lack of a quorum to break a filibuster, highlighting both the political and economic consequences of such events.",
