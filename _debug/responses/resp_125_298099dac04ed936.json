  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy entered La Santé prison in Paris on October 21, 2025, to begin serving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy related to using Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign. This makes him the first former head of state in modern French history to be imprisoned. Sarkozy, 70, was convicted of orchestrating a scheme from 2005 to 2007 while serving as interior minister, leveraging his political position to funnel money from Libya, led by Moammar Gadhafi. He will be held in solitary confinement, with limited contact with others, and has filed for immediate release. His lawyers argue the conviction is politically motivated and unjust, claiming he is an innocent man targeted by a conspiracy. A massive public demonstration of support in Paris, including chants and flags, reflects deep national sentiment. The case has intensified debate about judicial independence, with France’s top magistrate warning that political figures like President Emmanuel Macron visiting Sarkozy could undermine the integrity of the justice system. Sarkozy has expressed defiance, stating he will fight the conviction and plans to write a book about his prison experience.",
