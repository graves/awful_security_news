  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article explores the resurgence of cowboy imagery in American culture, driven by political conservatism, entertainment, and fashion. While the cowboy has long been a romanticized symbol tied to patriotism and rugged individualism—popularized by 19th-century shows and Hollywood films—its current ubiquity in media, politics, and advertising reflects deeper cultural anxieties. The trend is especially linked to conservative leaders like Donald Trump and George W. Bush, who use cowboy aesthetics to signal traditional values and a rejection of urban liberalism. However, the article highlights that this image is a mythologized construct, ignoring the historical reality that cowboys were predominantly Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. Recent efforts by Black artists and communities, such as Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' and Gabriela Hasbun’s photography, are beginning to correct this imbalance. Despite this, mainstream narratives continue to whitewash the cowboy's diverse roots, emphasizing only the romantic, heroic aspects while omitting poverty, labor, and systemic inequity. The article concludes that while the cowboy trend is a powerful cultural symbol, it is ultimately a commercial and political construct rather than an accurate reflection of American history.",
