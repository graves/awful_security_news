  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Under Donald Trump’s peace plan, Israel has withdrawn its forces to a 'yellow line' marking control over approximately 53% of the Gaza Strip, a temporary boundary described by some Israeli media as effectively becoming the new border. This move has pleased Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, who see it as a victory for their vision of expanded Israeli presence. However, the fortifications along the line may deepen tensions between Netanyahu’s domestic allies and U.S. officials who insist on maintaining the ceasefire and avoiding escalation. When Hamas allegedly violated the truce by killing soldiers, Israel responded with limited air strikes and emphasized attacks occurred within the yellow line to show compliance with ceasefire rules. Netanyahu insists that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza demilitarized, but U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have urged restraint, suggesting that real strategic decisions are increasingly being driven by American policy. The yellow line, while temporary, may become permanent if the second stage of negotiations fails, potentially enabling new settlements or even annexation of Gaza by hardline factions. This creates a delicate balancing act for Netanyahu, who must satisfy both domestic hardliners and international pressure to maintain peace.",
