    "The North Atlantic right whale population has increased to an estimated 384 individuals, up from the previous year, showing a positive trend after a decade of decline.",
    "The population growth is attributed to conservation measures, including new management in Canada and improved protections in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.",
    "Despite slow reproduction, four mother whales produced calves in the latest year, with shorter intervals between calves observed in established mothers, indicating improved reproductive health.",
    "A total of 11 calves were born, which is less than expected but still a positive sign, especially with no detected mortalities or injuries in the year.",
    "The species remains vulnerable due to threats from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement, and environmental groups call for stronger protections and enforcement of existing laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act.",
    "Scientists are cautious, noting that the population can turn on a dime, and long-term recovery depends on sustained conservation efforts and policy support."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The North Atlantic right whale, one of the rarest and most endangered whale species, has shown signs of recovery with an estimated population of 384 individuals in 2025—up from the previous year. This growth follows a decade of decline, during which the population dropped by 25% due to threats such as ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement. Scientists from the New England Aquarium’s Cabot Center and NOAA report that recent improvements in conservation, particularly new management measures in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence, may be helping the species. Notably, four mother whales produced calves this year, with shorter reproductive intervals observed, indicating improved health. Although only 11 calves were born—below researchers' hopes—no mortalities or injuries were detected, leading to cautious optimism. Environmental groups stress that the species remains on the brink of extinction and that stronger enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is essential to ensure long-term survival.",
