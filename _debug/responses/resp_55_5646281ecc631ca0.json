In one video, he called for ICE agents to be shot and said, 'If they show up to your neighborhood, it’s time we start shooting at you.' Another video referenced the September 10 murder of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, with Stanton allegedly saying 'do a lot more Charlie Kirks.' Authorities began investigating after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center flagged his inquiry about Israeli military locations.
