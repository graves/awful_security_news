    "China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 known rare-earth metals, adding five new metals (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) to its previous list of seven restricted metals (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium).",
    "The restrictions include export controls on specialized technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals, with effective implementation set for December 1, 2025.",
    "Foreign companies must obtain special approvals from Beijing to export rare-earth magnets and semiconductor materials containing at least 0.1% heavy rare-earth metals, and must justify the intended use of such products.",
    "China cites national security concerns, stating that certain foreign entities have transferred or processed Chinese rare-earth materials for military or sensitive applications, threatening China’s security and global non-proliferation efforts.",
    "Rare-earth metals are essential for advanced technologies including electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, LED TVs, camera lenses, fighter jets (like the F-35), submarines, missiles, and AI semiconductors.",
    "The United States is the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth products, having imported $22.8 million worth of such products in 2023, and sourced 70% of its rare-earth imports from China between 2020 and 2023.",
    "This move is seen as a strategic signaling action by China ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting at the APEC summit, designed to strengthen its negotiating position and demonstrate its ability to leverage supply chain dominance.",
    "Analysts note that while the restrictions may hurt US defence and technological industries, they also risk harming China’s own economy due to interdependence in supply chains.",
    "Exemptions are provided for exports related to emergency medical needs, public health emergencies, or disaster relief."

The move comes just weeks before a high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea. As China is the world’s largest producer and processor of rare-earth metals, these controls are seen as a strategic tool to strengthen its leverage in ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations. The U.S. is heavily dependent on Chinese rare-earths for critical defence technologies, such as F-35 fighter jets, submarines, missiles, and AI-enabled semiconductors, making it especially vulnerable. Analysts interpret the restrictions as a deliberate signaling action to demonstrate China’s ability to disrupt supply chains and pressure Washington. While the controls include exemptions for emergency medical and disaster relief, they underscore the deep interdependence between the U.S. and China in global supply chains, highlighting the geopolitical and economic risks tied to rare-earth metal availability.",
