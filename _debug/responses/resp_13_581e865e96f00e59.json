  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "As the federal government shutdown continues through October 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, will run out of funds in two weeks, threatening to leave millions of low-income Americans without food assistance in November. The Trump administration has not committed to funding the program and instead blames Democrats for failing to negotiate a spending deal, citing political agendas over food security. A $6 billion contingency fund is insufficient to cover the projected $8 billion in November benefits, and 17 states have paused new applications due to the inability to issue partial payments. While WIC was temporarily saved by a $300 million shift in tariff revenue, that funding cannot support SNAP. Advocacy groups stress that November is especially critical due to the approaching Thanksgiving holiday, and food pantries are already overwhelmed. Critics, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul, have condemned the administration’s actions as deliberate and harmful to vulnerable families. This marks a recurring crisis in food assistance during government shutdowns, raising urgent questions about the stability of the nation’s social safety net.",
