  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In October 2025, Russia has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s power and heating infrastructure, particularly in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes over the past month. These attacks, including one involving over 50 drones and casualties in Novhorod-Siverskyi, are part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians through cold and darkness. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attributes this to Russia’s tactics of prolonging suffering and has called on European allies for urgent military and financial support, including air defense systems and funding from frozen Russian assets. The European Union is considering using up to $200 billion in frozen Russian assets as a loan to Ukraine, though Russia claims this is illegal. Analysts note a recurring pattern: when US pressure on Russia decreases (e.g., after Trump's tone shifts), Russian attacks escalate. Zelensky remains skeptical of a potential summit with Putin in Budapest, hosted by Viktor Orban, warning that Russian leaders who block Ukraine cannot offer real peace. Despite ongoing challenges, Ukraine continues to respond with improved air defenses and retaliatory strikes on Russian infrastructure, emphasizing resilience and strategic adaptation.",
