  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, citing internal disagreements over military strategy in the Gaza conflict, particularly Hanegbi’s opposition to a full military takeover of Gaza City and his advocacy for a partial deal with Hamas. Hanegbi, who had served as NSC head since 2023, publicly admitted shared responsibility for the failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and called for a thorough investigation, which Netanyahu’s government has yet to establish. The move has drawn criticism from opposition figures like Gadi Eisenkot, who accused the government of evading accountability by replacing dissenting voices with loyalists. Gil Reich, the deputy NSC head, has been appointed as acting national security chief. The dismissal reflects deeper political divisions within Netanyahu’s administration and raises concerns about transparency and accountability in Israel’s response to the Hamas attack and ongoing war in Gaza.",
