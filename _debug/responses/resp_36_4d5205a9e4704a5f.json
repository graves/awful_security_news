    "The US Marine Corps fired a 155mm artillery shell over I-5 interstate in California during a 250th birthday celebration, resulting in a shell fragment striking a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser.",
    "The shell prematurely detonated mid-flight, a rare and concerning event, despite the Marine Corps having previously fired over 70 shells over the same route without incident.",
    "The demonstration occurred on the busiest highway in America, and despite theoretical safety based on high trajectory, one shell exploded prematurely, raising questions about reliability and risk assessment.",
    "The artillery used in the incident was part of a batch produced as part of a $5.5 billion investment to increase production for Ukraine’s war effort, with over 3 million shells already delivered.",
    "A 2024 Reuters investigation found manufacturing issues, including cracked shells and a change in explosive material (from TNT to a less accident-prone alternative), though the Army later reverted to TNT for cost and production efficiency.",
    "California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the firing as 'dangerous' and ordered the closure of I-5 ahead of the exercise, leading to a public spat with Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
    "The Marine Corps has not clarified who authorized the firing, when the last similar event occurred, or whether broader concerns exist about the batch of shells used.",
    "The incident prompted a full investigation by the Marine Corps, with the shell batch likely being frozen and suspended from future use until further analysis is complete."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live artillery demonstration over the I-5 interstate, resulting in a 155mm shell prematurely detonating mid-flight. The explosion sent fragments that struck a parked California Highway Patrol vehicle, prompting public concern and political conflict. The incident raised questions about the safety and reliability of the artillery batch, especially given that the route had not been used since the 1950s and that previous firings had been successful. The Marine Corps is investigating the cause, and the shell batch has been suspended. This event occurred amid a broader surge in US artillery production for Ukraine, which has tripled since 2022 and included a 2024 investigation revealing manufacturing issues and changes in explosive materials. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the demonstration as dangerous, while federal officials defended it as a routine, safe practice.",
