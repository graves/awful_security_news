  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major political force in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Mikie Sherrill are using Trump’s policies—such as the cancellation of the Gateway tunnel—and his influence to energize and mobilize voters. Sherrill blames Trump for economic harm, while Ciattarelli leverages Trump’s popularity to attract base support, even as he emphasizes the race is about New Jersey. Democrats are particularly alarmed by Trump’s gains in Passaic County, where he flipped a previously Democratic-leaning area in 2024, suggesting possible long-term voter realignment. The races are seen as early indicators of public sentiment toward Trump’s second term and critical tests for both parties ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
