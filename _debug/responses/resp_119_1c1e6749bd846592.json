  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A divided 9th Circuit court ruled that President Donald Trump lawfully exercised his authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut. The court found that the President could consider the totality of circumstances — including violent and disruptive protests in June, July, and August — when deciding on deployment, rejecting the judge’s narrow focus on isolated incidents in September. While the ruling applies to one of two restraining orders, the second remains in effect, so the immediate impact on deployment is unclear. Local officials, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Police Bureau officers, dispute the characterization of Portland as a 'war zone,' arguing that protests have been largely peaceful and manageable with local law enforcement. The federal government claims that protesters assaulted federal officers with rocks, bricks, and incendiary devices, but state officials and journalists counter that such incidents were minor and not indicative of a crisis. The decision is seen as affirming executive power in crisis response, but critics warn it could lead to dangerous overreach and undermine checks and balances.",
