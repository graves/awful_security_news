The US, through key figures like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, remains actively involved in diplomatic efforts. Aid deliveries to Gaza were temporarily paused but resumed, signaling efforts to maintain humanitarian components of the ceasefire. Tensions are heightened by claims of attacks in Rafah, where Hamas allegedly targeted an Israel-backed militia, and by accusations that Hamas has not returned all bodies of the deceased hostages. The situation remains volatile, with internal violence in Gaza, including an apparent public execution, and political pressure from Israeli figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, who criticizes the resumption of aid. The ceasefire remains fragile, and its long-term viability hinges on continued compliance and diplomatic intervention.",
