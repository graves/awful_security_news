  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in late September 2025. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution requires all duly elected members to be sworn in, and that no constitutional authority exists for the Speaker to delay this process based on session status or political strategy. Johnson claims he is following Nancy Pelosi’s precedent from past recesses, but the legal action asserts that such precedent does not justify blocking a new member’s seat. The lawsuit alleges that Johnson’s delay is politically motivated—specifically, to delay a petition on Jeffrey Epstein records and to gain leverage in budget negotiations. Mayes contends that Johnson, who is present at the Capitol, has no valid reason to deny the oath and seeks a court order allowing another qualified official to administer it. Grijalva has not spoken to Johnson in 28 days and is attempting to meet with him to resolve the standoff. This case raises constitutional questions about the role of the Speaker in member seating and the rights of elected officials.",
