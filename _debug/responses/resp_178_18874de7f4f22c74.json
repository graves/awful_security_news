  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details the collapse of Build a Rocket Boy (Barb), a video game studio founded by former Rockstar Games executive Leslie Benzies, following the disastrous launch of its flagship game MindsEye in June 2025. Despite attracting over £233 million in investment and a large team of employees, the studio failed to deliver a coherent vision, with development processes marked by chaotic direction, constant micro-management through 'Leslie tickets', and a culture of ignoring employee feedback. The launch was plagued by severe bugs, performance issues, and negative reviews, leading to employee burnout, a 'crunch' period of mandatory overtime, and eventual layoffs of between 250 and 300 staff. Former employees have accused Benzies and leadership of toxic management, poor communication, and a lack of respect for team input, culminating in a public outcry and union action. The failure of MindsEye is presented as a cautionary tale about the risks of unchecked ambition, poor leadership, and unsustainable development practices in the video game industry.",
