  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article discusses a recent jewellery heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where eight Napoleonic pieces were stolen in a four-minute attack using a truck-mounted ladder and angle grinder. This event is notable as it marks a shift from previous high-profile thefts, which primarily involved paintings like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. The 1911 Mona Lisa theft, carried out by Vincenzo Peruggia, is highlighted as a turning point that elevated the painting’s global fame. The article also covers earlier thefts — including the 1990 loss of Renoir’s portrait and the 1966 jewellery theft during a U.S. loan — and the Nazi looting of French art during WWII, which prompted a major evacuation effort led by Jacques Jaujard. The key insight is that jewellery thefts are more difficult to recover than painting thefts due to their high intrinsic value and the ability to be broken down, recut, and resold without traceability. Experts, such as Noah Charney, emphasize that recovery hinges on offering a large reward for the return of intact items, as disassembled components are nearly impossible to track. A crown belonging to Empress Eugenie was later recovered, demonstrating that not all stolen items disappear. The article underscores the ongoing vulnerability of cultural heritage institutions to both historical and modern criminal threats.",
