  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Seven universities, including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, and MIT, have rejected a White House proposal for a federal funding compact that would require universities to adopt ideological policies such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, limiting international enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes. The proposal, sent to nine institutions on October 1, 2025, aims to offer preferential funding and access to White House events in exchange for compliance. Universities argue that such demands threaten academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research funding, with leaders citing the risk of undermining free inquiry and innovation. While some institutions like the University of Texas at Austin remain open to dialogue, others have firmly rejected the offer, highlighting a widespread resistance in higher education to political intervention in academic governance. The White House has emphasized the need for ideological consistency in education, but critics warn that tying federal support to political conformity undermines the foundational principles of academic excellence and innovation.",
