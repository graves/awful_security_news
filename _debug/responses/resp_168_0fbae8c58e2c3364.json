  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In northern Pakistan’s climate-vulnerable Gilgit-Baltistan region, Indigenous knowledge—such as recognizing signs of glacial instability like heavy rain, animal behavior, and unusual sounds—is being used by local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to warn villagers of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), often saving lives where government early warning systems fail. Despite a $37 million GLOF-II project and official investments in sensors and sirens, communities report widespread distrust due to system failures, lack of real-time connectivity, and poor follow-up. Scientific data from the World Bank shows Pakistan’s temperature has risen 1.3°C since the 1950s—twice the global average—increasing glacial melt and flood risks. The article highlights that traditional human-based warnings, passed down through generations, remain more effective and trusted than technology, and calls for a reevaluation of how climate resilience strategies are implemented, emphasizing community trust, cultural knowledge, and institutional accountability.",
