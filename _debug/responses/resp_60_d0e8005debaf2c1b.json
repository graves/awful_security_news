  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "A former New York prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the death of inmate Robert Brooks, who was beaten multiple times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024. The beating, captured on silent body-camera footage, revealed guards inflicting severe injuries including damage to the spleen, liver, and lungs, with the final attack in the infirmary being fatal. While Kingsley was convicted, guards Mathew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer were acquitted of murder charges, though both faced charges of gang assault. The prosecution argued all guards acted as a gang with 'depraved indifference to human life,' and the case drew national attention due to the lack of concern shown by officers in the video. The case also underscores broader systemic issues in prison violence, as it is part of a larger pattern involving the fatal beating of Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State Correctional Facility, currently being prosecuted by the same special prosecutor, William Fitzpatrick. Attorney General Letitia James recused herself due to representing guards in civil litigation, leading to Fitzpatrick's appointment as special prosecutor. Six of ten guards indicted in February have either pleaded guilty or agreed to reduced charges, with a third guard scheduled to go on trial in January.",
