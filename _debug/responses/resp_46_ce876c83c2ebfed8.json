  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article investigates the hidden realities of Guatemala’s garment factories, known as maquilas, where tens of thousands of workers—mostly women—face exploitative labor conditions, including long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats. Despite being a key player in Guatemala’s economy, contributing to nearly 10% of GDP, these factories operate under weak labor oversight due to factory resistance, union suppression, and lack of accountability by US brands and Korean-owned suppliers. Workers, like Rutilia Cano and Alexandra, report being subjected to impossible quotas, unsafe living conditions, and threats, including violence against union members. US brands such as Target, Carhartt, and Ralph Lauren source from Guatemalan factories via intermediaries, with little legal responsibility for labor practices. The Guatemalan government, under President Bernardo Arévalo, has introduced reforms such as a 6% wage increase and stronger enforcement, but progress is slow due to resistance and power imbalances. A culture of fear, including threats to union leaders and harassment of female workers, persists, and severance payments—when they occur—are often minimal and delayed. The article ends with a call for systemic change, highlighting the gendered and economic vulnerability of garment workers in global supply chains.",
