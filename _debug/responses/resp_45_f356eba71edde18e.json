This marks the first time a former head of state in modern French history has been imprisoned. Sarkozy, who claims innocence and frames the case as a politically motivated judicial scandal, will be held in the VIP wing of La Santé Prison, historically reserved for high-risk or politically significant inmates such as Manuel Noriega, Carlos the Jackal, and Jacques Mesrine. His legal team has requested early release, with a court decision expected within two months. The case raises broader questions about political accountability, the role of foreign influence in elections, and the treatment of former leaders in the justice system.",
