  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "During the ongoing government shutdown, Capitol Police officers have been working without pay, missing their first full paycheck on October 10, 2025. The situation has drawn attention from lawmakers, with Senator Katie Britt blaming Democrats for the impasse, while Rep. Joe Morelle criticizes both the lack of negotiation and political disrespect—such as failure to oppose Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters and the delayed installation of a memorial honoring Capitol Police. The officers face immense pressure in their dual roles as enforcers and welcoming hosts, and their morale is further strained by public incidents and political slights. While they are currently holding up, one officer expresses doubt about their ability to continue doing so beyond a month. The Trump administration has proposed using funds to pay law enforcement, but Democrats question the legality and ethics of such actions.",
