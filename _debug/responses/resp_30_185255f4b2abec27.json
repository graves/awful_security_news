    "Iceland, long protected from mosquitoes due to its cold climate, has recorded its first confirmed wild mosquito population in the species Culiseta annulata.",
    "The mosquitoes were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, about 20 miles north of Reykjavík, by Björn Hjaltason, who spotted and collected a fly he suspected was a mosquito.",
    "The species Culiseta annulata is native to the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia, and is adapted to cold climates by surviving in sheltered areas during winter.",
    "This is the first documented instance of mosquitoes existing naturally in Iceland, unlike a previous isolated case involving a single mosquito found on an airplane at Keflavík Airport.",
    "Climate change may be increasing the potential for mosquitoes to establish in Iceland, though experts remain uncertain whether it directly caused this specific discovery.",
    "Experts like Colin J. Carlson suggest that the discovery may be due to natural range shifts, and that climate change’s role is still unclear and not definitively proven.",
    "Further monitoring is needed in spring to determine if the species can survive winter and become established in Iceland.",
    "Mosquitoes are known to expand their range with global warming, making their presence in Iceland a potential indicator of broader climate-related ecological shifts."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Iceland, known for its cold, frozen climate and long-standing absence of wild mosquitoes, has confirmed the presence of the Culiseta annulata mosquito species in the wild for the first time. The insects were discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, by citizen Björn Hjaltason, who collected a suspicious fly. The entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed the species, noting its adaptation to cold climates through sheltered winter survival. While climate change may be contributing to the expansion of mosquito habitats globally, experts remain cautious about directly linking this discovery to warming trends, as historical and geographic precedents suggest mosquitoes may have already reached such northern latitudes. Further monitoring is needed to determine if the species can establish a permanent population in Iceland.",
