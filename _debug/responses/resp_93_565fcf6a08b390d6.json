  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza, with the other body being that of Israeli citizen Ronen Engel. Hamas handed over both bodies to the Red Cross for identification, after which they were transferred to Israel. The ceasefire, which began last week, is under strain due to the delayed return of remaining hostages, slow aid access, and continued Israeli military operations, including a strike that killed civilians near the ceasefire line. The U.S. State Department warns of an impending Hamas ceasefire violation, while Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains and criticizes Israel for breaching the agreement. Israel insists the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed. Protests have erupted in Israel, and the Rafah crossing remains closed, pending Hamas’s fulfillment of its obligations. The situation underscores the humanitarian and political challenges of implementing a fragile ceasefire.",
