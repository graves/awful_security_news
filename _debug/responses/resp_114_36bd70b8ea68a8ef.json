  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The article details how President Donald Trump has escalated immigration enforcement through the deployment of the National Guard in multiple U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, D.C., and Memphis, often under the pretext of fighting crime. Despite data showing declining violent crime rates, Trump’s rhetoric conflates illegal immigration with urban lawlessness, fueling public fear and protests. The National Guard, which cannot legally make arrests, is being used to guard federal immigration facilities, protect ICE agents, and accompany raids — actions that blur the lines between law enforcement and immigration enforcement. These deployments have faced legal challenges, including a California court ruling that the use of troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The article highlights community fear — particularly among undocumented immigrants like Yackson in Chicago — and expert criticism of the administration’s strategy, which experts say creates a cycle where protests justify military intervention. The involvement of the Texas National Guard, with prior experience in border operations including the use of tear gas, adds a precedent for aggressive tactics. Overall, the article reveals a pattern of political and legal overreach that undermines public trust and raises constitutional questions about the use of military forces in domestic affairs.",
