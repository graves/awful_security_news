    "The yellow line in Gaza, established as part of the first stage of Donald Trump’s peace plan, marks Israel's control over approximately 53% of the Gaza Strip and serves as a temporary military boundary.",
    "The yellow line is seen as a strategic compromise that satisfies Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners by preserving Israeli military presence and potential for future settlements.",
    "Israeli military actions, such as air strikes and troop movements, are carefully calibrated to avoid violating the ceasefire and to maintain alignment with U.S. diplomatic expectations, especially from Vice President JD Vance and negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.",
    "Netanyahu faces pressure from both Washington and domestic hardline allies to show restraint, with U.S. officials urging him not to escalate tensions due to the sensitivity of the second stage of the peace deal.",
    "The decision to respond to Hamas violations with limited air strikes rather than a full-scale war demonstrates a political balancing act between domestic extremist demands and U.S. diplomatic interests.",
    "The yellow line may become a de facto border if negotiations fail at the second stage, potentially enabling new settlements in Gaza and raising the prospect of annexation by hardline Israeli factions.",
    "Netanyahu's position emphasizes that the war will not end until Hamas is fully disarmed and Gaza is demilitarized, a stance that reflects both his political strategy and the conditions of the peace agreement.",
    "The peace plan is structured in stages, with the second stage dependent on resolving power transitions in Gaza and Hamas disarmament—issues that remain unresolved and politically delicate.",
    "Israeli commentators argue that the real influence over military decisions is shifting from Israel to Washington, signaling a growing U.S. role in shaping Israel’s actions in Gaza.",
    "Public sentiment in Israel favors ending the war and bringing home hostages and soldiers, contrasting with the more aggressive positions of hardline coalition members."

  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The yellow line, marking Israel’s first stage of military withdrawal under Donald Trump’s peace plan, has become a pivotal political and military boundary in Gaza, controlling about 53% of the territory. While it satisfies Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners by preserving Israeli dominance, it also creates tension between his domestic allies who want war to resume and U.S. officials who urge restraint to protect the fragile ceasefire. Israel’s response to Hamas violations—limited airstrikes and a reaffirmed truce—demonstrates a strategic balancing act to maintain diplomatic credibility with Washington. The second stage of the peace plan, dependent on Hamas disarmament and power transfer, remains unresolved, raising concerns that the yellow line could become a de facto border and allow new settlements or annexation. Public sentiment favors peace and the return of hostages, while Netanyahu's insistence on full Hamas dismantlement and the long-term political flexibility of the staged deal reflect both domestic and international pressures.",
