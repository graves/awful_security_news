The article highlights how decades of neglect — including overcrowding, climate instability, and disrepair — have contributed to these breaches. In response, French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, have acknowledged systemic failures and announced major renovation plans, including new security systems, a dedicated room for the Mona Lisa, and a grand entrance. Despite past efforts, the Louvre continues to face significant challenges in protecting its priceless collection from both physical and institutional threats.",
