  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a highly coordinated seven-minute heist that occurred at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, October 19, 2025, thieves breached the Louvre Museum in Paris using a truck-mounted ladder and angle grinders to enter the Apollo Gallery, stealing eight of the nine items from the French Crown Jewels. Among the stolen pieces are a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, an emerald necklace and earrings from Empress Marie-Louise, and the crown of Empress Eugénie—damaged during the theft. The suspects, believed to be four armed with tools and using motorcycles, were unarmed but threatened guards. One item was left behind, and the museum remained closed as a security measure. The French government, including President Emmanuel Macron and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, condemned the act as a severe attack on national heritage. Police found tools and a yellow vest at the scene, and an attempt to burn the vehicle was thwarted. A probe into organized criminal activity and possible foreign interference is underway. Experts warn that thieves may melt or recut the jewelry, risking irreversible loss. This marks the first major museum heist at the Louvre in over a century, underscoring global concerns about the security of cultural artifacts.",
