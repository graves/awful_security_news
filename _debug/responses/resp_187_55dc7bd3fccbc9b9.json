  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "In a brazen daylight heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, eight priceless jewels were stolen by a highly professional criminal group, believed to be part of an organized crime network. Experts, including Dutch art detective Arthur Brand and jewellery historian Carol Woolton, suggest the stolen items were dismantled and sold in small pieces to avoid detection, with the gold and gems likely melted down or cut into smaller stones. The estimated value of the loot could reach £10 million, with larger stones worth around £500,000 each. French authorities suspect the robbery was driven by money laundering or criminal sponsorship, and a specialist police unit is investigating, including DNA analysis of items left at the scene. While public sentiment in France is deeply shocked—comparing the theft to losing the Mona Lisa—there remains a slim hope the items may one day reappear, based on past precedents like the 1948 Cartier theft. The emotional and cultural impact of the theft underscores its significance beyond the financial value.",
