  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The body of Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai national taken hostage during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, has been identified as the twelfth deceased hostage returned to Israel. His body, along with that of Israeli citizen Ronen Engel, was handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross and formally identified. This partial fulfillment of the ceasefire agreement has sparked renewed tensions, as 16 of the 28 deceased hostages remain unaccounted for. Israel demands full compliance with the ceasefire, including the return of all bodies and the disarmament of Hamas, while Hamas claims it has returned all accessible remains and accuses Israel of using the bodies as leverage. The Rafah crossing remains closed, severely restricting humanitarian aid, and Israel has conducted military strikes on a civilian vehicle, resulting in civilian deaths. The U.S. State Department warns of an imminent Hamas ceasefire violation, and protests have erupted in Israel over the delays. The article underscores the emotional, political, and humanitarian stakes of the hostage recovery process in determining the future of the Gaza conflict.",
