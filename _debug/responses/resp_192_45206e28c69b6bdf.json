  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "The AWS outage on 2025-10-21 caused widespread disruptions to UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting concerns about the UK's over-reliance on US cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With both firms holding between 30% and 40% of the UK cloud market, their dominance creates systemic risk through 'nested dependencies' — where even services not directly hosted on their platforms rely on their infrastructure. Experts warn that assuming these providers are 'too big to fail' is a misconception, especially given the ripple effects of outages. While using major cloud platforms offers cost, scalability, and security advantages, experts stress the need for political action, including mandatory use of multiple cloud providers and data replication, to enhance national resilience and support domestic innovation. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended designating AWS and Azure as having 'strategic market status' to promote competition, and government officials are actively working to diversify the cloud ecosystem by encouraging UK and European providers to participate.",
