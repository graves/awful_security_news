The United States, led by President Donald Trump, fiercely opposed the tax, calling it a 'scam tax' and threatening sanctions—including visa restrictions and port access denial—against countries supporting it. While the European Union, Brazil, and small island nations like Vanuatu backed the tax as a tool to fund emissions reductions and promote net-zero goals by 2050, oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia resisted. Experts warn that the failure undermines decades of climate diplomacy, delays progress toward clean shipping, and raises concerns about future climate negotiations, including the upcoming COP30 in Belém, Brazil.",
