  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "An appeals court in Colombia has overturned the conviction of former President Álvaro Uribe on charges of bribery and witness tampering, citing structural flaws, vague premises, and lack of comprehensive analysis in the original trial. The court found the phone wiretap evidence used in the trial to be invalid due to being initiated during an unrelated investigation, raising significant legal and political controversy. The decision has reignited national debate, with Uribe’s supporters celebrating the outcome and critics, including President Gustavo Petro, criticizing the court’s decision. The case remains politically charged, influencing public discourse ahead of Colombia’s upcoming elections and deepening the polarization around Uribe’s legacy—seen by some as a stabilizing force and by others as linked to human rights abuses and paramilitary ties. The U.S. government has also weighed in, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the verdict a victory of justice, while the Democratic Center party has announced that Uribe will run for senator if legally permitted.",
