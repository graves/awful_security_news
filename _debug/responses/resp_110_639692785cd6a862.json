  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "President Donald Trump announced a sharp reduction in U.S. aid to Colombia and imposed new tariffs on Colombian exports, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being ineffective in combating drug production and labeling him an 'illegal drug leader.' The U.S. Defense Department claimed a strike on a vessel linked to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a group that denies involvement in drug trafficking, without providing evidence. Petro rejected these accusations, calling them 'rude and ignorant' and asserting that the U.S. actions—such as the killing of fisherman Alejandro Carranza—constitute a threat to Colombian sovereignty and national dignity. Colombia, which is the world's largest exporter of cocaine, faces a deepening security crisis, with rising coca cultivation and violence. The U.S. has already increased pressure on Venezuela, and now expanding such actions to Colombia risks destabilizing a key regional ally, undermining Colombia’s military and anti-drug efforts, and potentially triggering international legal action. Experts warn that cutting U.S. aid during a time of heightened security threats could have catastrophic strategic consequences for both nations and the broader region.",
