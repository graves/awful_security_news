While some local businesses report no immediate impact, others face declining bookings, and advocates warn that the lack of rangers and staff poses serious safety risks, including unauthorized drone use, base jumping, and trash accumulation. In response, advocacy groups are urging park closures to protect public safety and preserve natural resources. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., the shutdown has unexpectedly boosted visits to private museums, demonstrating shifting tourism patterns. However, the long-term economic and environmental impacts on local communities and national parks remain a significant concern.",
