She won the vote in the lower house with 237 votes, narrowly defeating opposition leader Yoshikoko Noda. Her victory was secured through a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation Party, which provided crucial support despite the coalition lacking a majority in both houses. The new government, led by Takaichi, is expected to prioritize tackling rising prices and economic recovery, while continuing policies associated with Shinzo Abe, such as military strengthening and constitutional revision. Despite pledges to increase gender diversity in government, only three women are appointed—most of whom are party loyalists. Takaichi’s controversial views on imperial succession, same-sex marriage, and her historical ties to the Yasukuni Shrine have drawn criticism from China and South Korea. Her government faces significant instability risks due to its minority status and need to form alliances with other opposition parties to pass legislation.",
