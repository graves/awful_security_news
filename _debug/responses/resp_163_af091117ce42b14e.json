  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "On October 19, 2025, Russia claims to have captured the village of Pleshchiivka in Donetsk, while Ukraine remains silent. A Ukrainian drone strike in occupied Kherson kills two displaced people, and an explosion at a weapons plant in Sterlitamak in Russia results in three deaths and five injuries. At the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, damaged power lines have led to emergency repairs to prevent a meltdown, with UN nuclear watchdog Rafael Grossi confirming the action. Austria reverses its earlier stance and supports the EUâ€™s new sanctions against Russia, indicating a shift in European policy toward greater pressure on Moscow.",
