  "summaryOfNewsArticle": "Virginia Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, has urged King Charles III to strip Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title, citing allegations that the prince forced her to have sex when she was 17, including at Ghislaine Maxwell’s London home in 2001 and on Epstein’s properties. Prince Andrew has already voluntarily relinquished his titles, including the Duke of York and membership in the Order of the Garter, and has publicly denied the accusations. The broader context includes ongoing scrutiny over Prince Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, a pattern of private contact contradicted by his 2019 claim of severing ties. Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir is expected to further detail these allegations, and survivors like Haley Robson view the removal of Prince Andrew’s titles as a long-delayed but necessary act of accountability. The move may mark a turning point in public expectations for royal accountability, especially in light of the monarchy’s role in upholding justice for survivors of sexual abuse.",
